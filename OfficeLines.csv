All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?,Michael
"Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...",Jim
"So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?",Michael
"Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.",Jim
"All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.",Michael
"[on the phone] Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. [quick cut scene] All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. [hangs up] That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... [Clears throat] So that's the way it's done.",Michael
"I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam?",Michael
Well. I don't know.,Pam
"If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. [growls]",Michael
What?,Pam
Any messages?,Michael
"Uh, yeah. Just a fax.",Pam
"Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.",Michael
You haven't told me.,Pam
It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.,Michael
"People say I am the best boss. They go, 'God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious.' 'And you get the best out of us.' [shows the camera his WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.",Michael
[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming],Dwight
"My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.",Jim
Whassup!,Michael
Whassup! I still love that after seven years.,Jim
Whassup!,Michael
Whassup!,Dwight
Whass...up!,Michael
Whassup.,Dwight
"[Strains, grunts] What?",Michael
Nothing.,Jim
OK. All right. See you later.,Michael
All right. Take care.,Jim
Back to work.,Michael
[on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.,Jan
"Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. [walking out of his office] Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah.",Michael
"Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?",Jan
Um... Me no get an agenda.,Michael
What? I'm sorry?,Jan
I didn't get any agenda.,Michael
"Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.",Jan
Really? I didn't... [looks at Pam] Did we get a fax this morning?,Michael
"Uh, yeah, the one...",Pam
"Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?",Michael
You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.,Pam
"Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.",Michael
Do you want to look at mine?,Jan
"Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.",Michael
"OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.",Jan
OK...,Michael
"Michael, don't panic.",Jan
"No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.",Michael
"No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided.",Jan
All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!,Michael
I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.,Jan
OK. No problem.,Michael
"This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.",Jan
"Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?",Michael
"Question. How long do we have to... [Telephone rings] Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?",Michael
Go ahead.,Jan
Packman.,Michel
"Hey, you big queen.",Todd Packer
"Oh, that's not appropriate.",Michael
"Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today?",Todd Packer
"Uh, I don't know what you mean.",Michael
I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?,Todd Packer
"Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.",Michael
So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.,Jan
"No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. [zips his lips] Like that.",Michael
So what does downsizing actually mean?,Phyllis
Well...,Stanley
You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.,Oscar
I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.,Angela
"Yeah, it'll be you.",Kevin
I have an important question for you.,Pam
Yes?,Jim
Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?,Pam
"Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.",Jim
"Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.",Michael
Hey.,Michael
Hey.,Ryan
This is Mr. Scott.,Pam
Guilty! Guilty as charged!,Michael
Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.,Ryan
"Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.",Michael
Yup.,Ryan
"Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! [hold hand up for a high five] Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler. [Continues with cod German]",Michael
"I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good.",Pam
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.,Pam
"Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?",Jim
What?,Dwight
What are you doing?,Jim
Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.,Dwight
It's not on your desk.,Jim
"It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.",Dwight
You can't do that.,Dwight
Why not?,Jim
Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.,Dwight
[crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.,Jim
Downsizing?,Dwight
"Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.",Dwight
You just still have these messages from yesterday.,Pam
"Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. [Imitating Six-Million Dollar Man sound effect]",Michael
What?,Pam
"Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.",Michael
Don't we all?,Pam
I'm sorry?,Michael
Nothing.,Pam
"If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. [Sighs]",Michael
"I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect. [Imitating a PA] Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.",Michael
"People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable.",Michael
Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.,Michael
I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.,Dwight
Assistant to the Regional Manager.,Michael
"OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?",Dwight
I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.,Michael
Can't you just tell us.,Oscar
"Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?",Dwight
You don't know what it is. [Laughs],Michael
OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.,Dwight
I don't need your permission.,Michael
Go ahead.,Dwight
Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.,Michael
I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.,Ryan
"Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?",Oscar
Not gonna happen.,Michael
It could be out of your hands Michael.,Stanley
"It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.",Michael
Can you promise that?,Stanley
On his mother's grave.,Dwight
No.,Michael
What?,Phyllis
"Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.",Michael
It's just that we need to know.,Stanley
"I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.",Michael
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.,Pam
Are you sure about that?,Man
"Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.",Michael
"Pam, information is power.",Dwight
"You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?",Stanley
"No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.",Michael
"If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.",Jim
"Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... [Laughs]",Pam
"Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.",Michael
What's up? Nice to meet you.,Ryan
Introduce yourself. Be polite.,Michael
"Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.",Dwight
"Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.",Michael
"Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.",Dwight
That's his profit.,Michael
"New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.",Dwight
Damn it! Jim!,Dwight
"OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?",Michael
He put my stuff in Jell-O again.,Dwight
[Laughing],Pam
That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.,Dwight
"It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.",Dwight
What is that?,Michael
That is my stapler.,Dwight
"No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.",Michael
"OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?",Dwight
How do you know it was me?,Jim
It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?,Dwight
"Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.",Michael
Yeah.,Dwight
"And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.",Michael
"OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.",Jim
[Laughing] Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.,Michael
You should've put him in custardy.,Ryan
Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.,Michael
"OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.",Dwight
Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.,Michael
Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.,Jim
So when are we going out?,Pam
"Tonight, hopefully.",Jim
OK. Yeah.,Pam
"Hey, man.",Roy
What's going on?,Jim
"Hey, baby.",Roy
Hey.,Pam
Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.,Pam
Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?,Pam
"No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home.",Roy
OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.,Pam
You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.,Jim
"It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going.",Roy
"Yeah, yeah.",Jim
Um... What's in the bag?,Jim
Just tell her I'll talk to her later.,Roy
"No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.",Jim
Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head],Jim
"So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. [Knock at door] Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?",Michael
Yeah.,Ryan
"You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?",Michael
All right.,Ryan
"Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to...",Michael
You got a fax.,Pam
"Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.",Michael
What? Why?,Pam
"Why? Well, theft and stealing.",Michael
Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?,Pam
Post-it Notes.,Michael
"Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?",Pam
"50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.",Michael
Are you serious?,Pam
Yeah. I am.,Michael
I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.,Pam
But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.,Michael
"[Pam starts crying] You been X'd punk! [Laughing] Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you.",Michael
You're a jerk.,Pam
I don't know about that.,Michael
"What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, 'Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?' Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.",Michael
Hey.,Pam
Hey.,Jim
How are things?,Jim
Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...,Pam
"Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?",Jim
"It's better, thanks.",Pam
Good. Good.,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
That's great,Jim
Is...?,Pam
Yeah?,Jim
Um... Are you...,Pam
Am I walking out?,Jim
Yes.,Pam
"Yes, I... Do you want to...",Jim
Yeah.,Pam
Great. Let me just...,Jim
"[Car horn honking] Oh, Roy.",Jim
"Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend.",Pam
"Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here.",Jim
"Dwight Schrute. My father's name, also Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name, Dweide Schrude, Amish. That's my family. I don't know where they came, the Amish, came from originally. Uh, Amland.",Dwight
[holding up a Dundie and pretending it is talking] Hello. I'm Michael Scott. I'm the best boss in the world.,Michael
"My name is Jim Halpert and I am a sales rep, which is a very important job. Um, without me dozens literally dozens of small businesses would go paperless. They would have to write on their hands, or bed sheets, or who knows you know. Total chaos, total chaos. I mean or they could get their paper somewhere else. Staples maybe. I don't know.",Jim
"Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam?",Michael
I guess.,Pam
"Yeah, at one time or another every guy in the office has sprayed on Pam.",Michael
What?,Pam
Messages?,Michael
"People respond to the human touch and that's what I give them. I can look at a client and I can say, 'Hello, how are you? How's business been going?' And we can go back and forth for sometime and uh, then I'll say, How much, how many reams do you want?' And they'll order it and then I'll take care of all the sales. I'll make sure that they get that paper. And they appreciate that.",Dwight
"Ah, right here. Three Stooges. High five. [Michael and Ryan high five] Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. [camera cuts to Pam then back to Michael] Now, who was the one before Curly?",Michael
"Uh, Shemp.",Ryan
Curly? Very good. Curly Joe DeRita.,Michael
Just Curly. Joe DeRita was different.,Ryan
"Well, comedy's kinda my thing. Watch this, here's Curly Joe. Mmm. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Oh, I forgot. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm Hitler. Right. [Continues with cod German] Me, me, me, me, me, me. Curly Joe Hitler. [laughs]",Michael
"All these people are walking around and they're happy and their lives are just going along, ignorance is bliss. But if they knew what was lurking on the other side of that fence that furry monster. [imitating monster] 'I'm gonna get you, downsizing.' No. They wouldn't... They'd freak. And I'm not going to play God. They look to me for support. And they look to me for guidance and leadership. And I think if I could lie to them and it serves them, then that's what I'm going to do.",Michael
"So this is our sales staff. They are the ones who are making calls and making us lots of money. [comes to a screeching halt and laughs] This is accounting. The numbers dudes. Do not let the job description fool you, they are all completely crazy. Especially that guy, he is a mental patient. [camera zooms in on Kevin] Not literally of course, that wouldn't work. The last place you'd want somebody like that is accounting. [hides behind office plant] 'Very interesting, but stupid.' Artie Johnson. It's a crazy place.",Michael
"My name is Angela and um, I'm in charge of the accounting department. There are three of us, Kevin and Oscar.",Angela
"It's my job to keep the books in order. And, um, I... I'm, uh, immediately below my supervisor.",Oscar
"Oscar, how do I describe him. He's like a stapler. Do I need a stapler? Yes. But, I'm still the one that has to push it down.",Angela
There's a lot of anxiety. I don't want to get laid off. This place is like five minutes from my house.,Oscar
I don't wanna be laid off. This is a good job for me. 'Cause I need my nights free. I'm in a band.,Kevin
"Not very worried about downsizing right now. Because, uh, I think you've met Kevin and um...",Angela
"Can I just say one thing? Um, my friend is Jewish, Art Geller. And a couple of years ago he, um, showed me how you can plant a tree in Israel, so I planted a tree. So... You know 'cause... Yeah we work in paper. Well, you know, I try to give back.",Oscar
"I have a lot of cat figurines on my desk. I think cats, really, are old souls. And, uh, Phyllis thinks so too.",Angela
"What you don't know... Well, it can hurt you, but if you don't know it won't hurt you. Then, you can just be happy for a little while at least.",Michael
What's that?,Michael
Wired.,Pam
"Oh, John Belushi. What a crazy guy. Phew, freaked myself out this morning.",Michael
"Oh, yeah.",Pam
"Yeah. I thought I found a lump. I checked the, uh... I check the jewels every month. This time... You know, it's a little different. It was fine. It was fine. But freaky, man, you know. Testicular cancer, God. Cancer, whoa testicles. So... What's, um... What you eating?",Michael
Smoked turkey.,Pam
"Oh, place around the corner. Nice. All right. See you later.",Michael
Do I need to speak up? [grabs boom microphone] Hello.,Michael
[boom microphone drops into the camera shoot] Can you move it out? Can you move it? Is that all right? Can you make that work?,Documentary Crew Member
That's fine.,Dwight
"[new take] No, you don't even need ... That's fine. We'll keep it...",Documentary Crew Member
I'm sorry it makes me nervous.,Dwight
"Understood, but it is what we need to capture what you're saying as clearly as possible.",Documentary Crew Member
"I understand. It's in a blind spot because I'm trained in several martial arts and one of them, uh, includes, uh, an awareness that the masters bring, uh, of anything on all sides of you. It could be behind you or whatever. This is directly in a blind spot, so I'm trained to respond negatively to something right above my head. [new take] This now I have an eye on. You see, it's on my periphery and if I needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow. [does a martial arts move with his hands] I could come right out. I mean, I know you're doing your job, but... Documentary Crew Member: [talking over Dwight] It's...",Dwight
I'm doing my job.,Dwight
"I think better to be a happy idiot then a, um... Then someone who knows the truth.",Michael
"Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?",Michael
"Oh, I'm all set, thanks.",Mr. Brown
Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.,Michael
"Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited.",Michael
"That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, '100% post-consumer content.' What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.",Jim
Do you really have to do that right now?,Jim
Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.,Dwight
"Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.",Jim
Retaliation. Tit for tit.,Dwight
That is not the expression.,Jim
"Well, it should be.",Dwight
"This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?",Jim
Solitaire?,Jim
"Yeah, Freecell.",Pam
Six on seven.,Jim
I know. I saw that.,Pam
"So then, why didn't you do it?",Jim
I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.,Pam
Who doesn't love that?,Jim
"Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?",Michael
All right.,Oscar
Did you have a good weekend going there?,Michael
It was fine.,Oscar
"Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. [to Mr. Brown] Oh, hey! This is Oscar---",Michael
Martinez.,Oscar
"Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis!",Michael
Great. We're all set.,Mr. Brown
"Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?",Michael
"Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.",Jim
"It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.",Michael
You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.,Jim
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great.,Mr. Brown
"Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!",Michael
"Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance.",Mr. Brown
"You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race.",Michael
"Uh, see this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind.",Mr. Brown
"Exactly, were not...",Michael
That's fighting ignorance with more ignorance.,Mr. Brown
With tolerance.,Michael
No. With more ignorance.,Mr. Brown
Ignorance.,Michael
"Right. Exactly. Uh, instead, we need to celebrate our diversity.",Mr. Brown
Let's celebrate.,Michael
Right. OK.,Mr. Brown
Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right?,Michael
"Yes, exactly. Now here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that...",Mr. Brown
You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.,Michael
I have two. White and Indian.,Dwight
"Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?",Mr. Brown
Yes.,Michael
Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.,Mr. Brown
OK.,Michael
"Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out.",Mr. Brown
A few of the ground rules?,Dwight
"Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.",Michael
"OK, can we steer away from gay people?",Dwight
Um...,Mr. Brown
"I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.",Dwight
"Well, we only have an hour.",Mr. Brown
I figured it would save time.,Dwight
OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...,Michael
Mr. Brown.,Mr. Brown
"Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.",Michael
"Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK.",Mr. Brown
"How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?",Michael
So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome.,Mr. Brown
I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.,Michael
"Well, let's have someone who wasn't involved in the reenactment.",Mr. Brown
"OK, I will play guy listening.",Michael
"Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember?",Mr. Brown
I remember.,Kevin
Great. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening.,Mr. Brown
OK.,Michael
Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.,Michael
"Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.",Kevin
"OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me... [As Chris Rock] Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass... [Bleep] I take care of my kid!",Michael
Wait a second.,Mr. Brown
[Bleep] They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!,Michael
Stop it!,Mr. Brown
[As Chris Rock] What you want a cookie?,Michael
"Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.",Mr. Brown
"Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.",Dwight
"Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?",Mr. Brown
"A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.",Dwight
OK.,Mr. Brown
"A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.",Dwight
"Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.",Mr. Brown
We all have a hero in our heart.,Dwight
"Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge.",Mr. Brown
[Clears throat] I don't think I can sign this.,Michael
I can't leave until you do.,Mr. Brown
"Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?",Michael
"Michael, can I talk to you candidly?",Mr. Brown
Sure.,Michael
We both know that I'm here because of the comments you made.,Mr. Brown
"Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit.",Michael
"Um, it's not throwing me. I need your signature.",Mr. Brown
"OK, well I know. You told me that several times.",Michael
"Yes, but you're not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need.",Mr. Brown
OK.,Michael
Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed.,Mr. Brown
"Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.",Michael
Don't worry about dating.,Mr. Brown
I won't.,Michael
OK. Thank you.,Mr. Brown
"Yeah, yeah.",Michael
"I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness...' Open-mindedness, is that even a word? '...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck.' [Laughing] He's going to lose it when he reads that.",Michael
"Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.",Jim
"I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart.' I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, 'Mr. Brown,' he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears.",Michael
All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good.,Michael
"Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]",Toby
Get out.,Michael
I'm sorry.,Toby
"No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape.",Michael
"[on the tape] Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.",Michael
OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?,Michael
": Uh, is that it?",Jim
Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.,Michael
It was kind of hard to hear.,Kevin
"Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...",Michael
I have a customer meeting.,Kelly
"Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.",Michael
What part Native American?,Oscar
Two fifteenths.,Michael
"Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.",Oscar
"Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.",Michael
"OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.",Oscar
"Oh, yeah...",Michael
"And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.",Oscar
Wow.,Michael
My parents were Mexican.,Oscar
"Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?",Michael
Thank... Yeah...,Oscar
"Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?",Michael
Mexican isn't offensive.,Oscar
"Well, it has certain connotations.",Michael
Like what?,Oscar
Like... I don't... I don't know.,Michael
"What connotations, Michael? You meant something.",Oscar
"No. Now, remember that honesty...",Michael
I'm just curious.,Oscar
"...empathy, respect... [Phone ringing] Jim! Jim!",Michael
Hello? Hello?,Jim
"I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done.",Michael
Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's...,Michael
Oh this is a good one.,Michael
"Um, hi. How are you?",Pam
Fine. How are you?,Stanley
Great.,Pam
Push it.,Michael
I admire your culture's success in America.,Stanley
Thank you.,Pam
Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.,Michael
Who am I supposed to be?,Stanley
"No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.",Michael
"Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.",Dwight
Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.,Dwight
"That's nice, Dwight.",Pam
"OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.",Dwight
"OK, I like your food.",Pam
"Outback steakhouse. [Australian accent] I'm Australian, mate!",Dwight
"Pam, come on. 'I like your food.' Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real.",Michael
"OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver.",Pam
"Oh, man, am I a woman?",Dwight
"You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. 'Too soon for Arabs.' Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court.",Michael
What are you watching?,Jim
Chappelle's Show.,Ryan
Really?,Jim
I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.,Ryan
No way. I think she likes this stuff.,Jim
"Great. She's cute, huh?",Ryan
"Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but...",Jim
"Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch.",Ryan
"Oh, yeah. She's hot.",Jim
Hey.,Kevin
Hey.,Angela
You wanna go to the beach?,Kevin
Sure.,Angela
You wanna get high?,Kevin
No.,Angela
"I think you do, mon.",Kevin
Stop...,Angela
OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.,Michael
"[Voice raised, Indian accent] Kelly, how are you?",Michael
I just had the longest meeting.,Kelly
"Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my... [slap!]",Michael
"[trying not to cry] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority.",Michael
"[on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.",Jim
"I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food.",Michael
[Itialian accent]Maybe some spagh-etti.,Kevin
"Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.",Michael
It's collard greens.,Stanley
What?,Michael
It's collard greens.,Stanley
"That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.",Michael
"[Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey.",Jim
[stirs] Mmmm.,Pam
Hey.,Jim
Oh.,Pam
We can go.,Jim
Sorry.,Pam
That's fine.,Jim
Uh... Not a bad day.,Jim
Thanks for filling these out. I promise this will be quick. We only have about an hour.,Mr. Brown
Yeah. I would like to see us erase 100 years of racism in an hour.,Michael
Does this company have 100 years to erase?,Mr. Brown
"No, the country.",Michael
"Oh right, more like 200 years.",Mr. Brown
"Yeah, more like a 1,000.",Michael
"Okay, um. Uh, I'll try to make this quick.",Mr. Brown
"I am a salesman, okay. And I don't think we should be doing this during prime sales hours. If you can prove to me that diversity is going to help my sales, I'll go elephant running with James Earl Jones. I really will, but not on spec.",Dwight
"HERO, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.",Mr. Brown
"I just think that HERO? It's cute, but it's... It's empty, you know? It's easy. Dwight, you know what, I came up with some terms of my own. Could you put these on the board? The first one is Inclusion, New Attitudes, Color-blind...",Michael
"Oh, nice.",Mr. Brown
Expectations....,Michael
Good.,Mr. Brown
Thank you. Sharing...,Michael
Great.,Mr. Brown
And tolerance.,Michael
Beautiful.,Mr. Brown
"Um, that spells incest.",Pam
"Oh, my sorry. That is not appropriate.",Mr. Brown
"Well, it's not ideal but you have to give me some credit 'cause I made it into a word.",Michael
"Yeah, but it's not appropriate. This is not helpful as a memory aid.",Mr. Brown
"I will give you a number of reasons why it is, actually. Okay, first, incest is bad. Racism is bad. No brainer, right? Two, incest. We're all a family, right? We're all brothers and sisters. Racial message? Um? Number three, and this is a fact. The states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest. Okay? And finally...",Michael
"Okay, Michael, I just...",Mr. Brown
"No, no, no, no, wait. Final one, final one this is important. The more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest, literally.",Michael
"It would've been just as easy for him to spell insect. Of course, that wouldn't have made any sense either.",Pam
Does anyone have anything else at all? Anyone besides Michael?,Mr. Brown
I have something.,Ryan
"Yes, please.",Mr. Brown
"Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about...",Ryan
"Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry this guy's a temp and I should've told you that.",Michael
"No, no, no, no. An outsider's perspective would probably be pretty helpful.",Mr. Brown
"Yeah, but no, seriously. Uh, you know, he's not a member of the full staff so, uh, Ryan you wanna just step outside?",Michael
What do you want me to do?,Ryan
"Well, maybe you should go down to the parking lot. You know what. Yes, go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots. Cool? 'Cause the handicaps get a raw deal. Oh, you know what. That ties right into New Attitudes. New attitudes about handicap people. Very important.",Michael
"I'm sorry, Michael. We're actually out of time.",Mr. Brown
"Yeah, um, there's good things about Michael. He uh, uh... Yeah, definitely. Um...",Pam
"In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck.' [laughing] He's going to lose it when he reads that. Doh! Hogan! Not again, Hogan! Get Col. Burkhalter on the phone! [laughing] I'm kind of a Hogan around here. And kind of, Jan is kind of Col. Burkhalter, then Dwight is Schultz. But, it's... Oh, God. We have fun. We have fun. 'Cause he's gonna be pissed. [making voice] No doubt about it.",Michael
What you doing?,Dwight
Freecell.,Jim
Solitaire is a one-player game. It can't have two players.,Dwight
"Well, I mean.",Jim
What's your win rate?,Dwight
Seventy-six percent. What's yours?,Pam
You're not allowed to play two-player. You need to start over.,Dwight
You're doing fine.,Pam
Are we going? [Dwight puts four fingers in front of the camera to start a countdown] Don't do that. Just say action when we're ready.,Michael
"Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott, Diversity Tomorrow, take four. And action.",Dwight
"[mumbling] Should I... turn, no. Do it again.",Michael
"Diversity Tomorrow, take five. Action.",Dwight
"Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles... Damn it. Okay, sorry. Don't laugh; please don't laugh this time Dwight. You're... it's, it's bugging me. Let me give myself a countdown, ready? Three, two, one.",Michael
Take six.,Dwight
"Just let me do it! God! Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton... Keep the camera steady please! People are gonna get sea sick watching this. Ready? Three, two, one.",Michael
Action.,Dwight
"Don't. Please don't say anything. [sighs] Oh, God.",Michael
"And action... Lights, camera, action. Whenever you're ready.",Dwight
"Could I count myself down please, Dwight. Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.",Michael
Cut.,Dwight
[wandering around the room during his diversity exercise] I want you to push it. I want you to push 'cause breakthroughs are right around the corner. Something's going to pop here. Something's going to pop between a party. Feel what it's like to be in someone else's skin. What does it feel like to be a different race? It feels pretty bad doesn't it. So let that come out.,Michael
"Yeah, I marched on Washington back in the day. I went to the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, U.S. Mint, congressman talked to our class. It was pretty cool.",Michael
Talk like you're talking to that race. I have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile. So keep it going. [camera shows Devon sitting outside with West Nile],Michael
"Um, what's going on here?",Jim
People treat us like the race on our forehead. And then we guess what race we are.,Pam
"Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good. [goes to the index cards and writes another race down]",Jim
"Oh, man, am I a woman?",Dwight
"Yes, yes.",Jim
God!,Dwight
How embarrassing is it? That's not fair. Here...,Jim
It's not fair.,Dwight
Try this. [takes Dwight's 'Asian' race and switches it with the one he wrote],Jim
Thank you. Thank you very much.,Dwight
Go get 'em.,Jim
"Good. [clears throat] So, am I a hunter gather culture?",Dwight
No.,Pam
Do I live near a harbor or an ocean?,Dwight
No.,Pam
"No, I'm an inland. Am I a mountainous?",Dwight
No.,Pam
Am I nomadic?,Dwight
No.,Pam
"Okay, okay, okay, okay. I think I got this. Um, I am treated in a foreign way with a great deal of prejudice. Am I one of those tribes in Africa? The piggies, or whatever?",Dwight
No.,Pam
"No. But I am, I am human, right? [Pam hesitates]",Dwight
[Dwight's new race is 'Dwight'] I could be French.,Dwight
"[takes his 'Dwight' race off his forehead] Damn it, Jim! That's not funny, Jim!",Dwight
"Oh, okay. Here we go, breakthrough radar. What happened? What happened here?",Michael
It didn't have anything to do with race.,Pam
"Okay, all right. Let's keep on track. Keep on point. Let's do it.",Michael
One time we had an ethnic festival in Scranton. One time.,Pam
"Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my... [Kelly slaps Michael] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Kelly thank you. [claps] She's not here, but she gets it. That's what we have been looking for. The whole time. [trying not to cry] Oh, man. This is what I thrive on. You know? It's like Don Rickles on acid, man. Right?",Michael
"Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?",Jim
"What, huh?",Michael
What card was she?,Pam
I think she wasn't wearing a card.,Jim
It's good. This is good. We got it happening now. All right? Let's keep it rolling. Let's round it up.,Michael
Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.,Michael
I'm not making any copies.,Pam
"Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.",Michael
Nothing new.,Pam
Lay them on me. What?,Michael
There's nothing new.,Pam
That's not what you said earlier.,Michael
"Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... [nods toward camera]",Pam
"The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.",Michael
"So, which health plan have you decided on?",Jan
"I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.",Michael
"Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?",Jan
I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.,Michael
The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.,Jan
"Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good.",Michael
Michael.,Jan
You gotta crack these things open.,Michael
"You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.",Jan
"Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.",Michael
It's your job. So...,Jan
"Well, it's a suicide mission, you know.",Michael
Michael... maybe... I mean...,Jan
"There, there...",Michael
"Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.",Jan
[scoffs] When have you ever done that?,Michael
I'm doing it right now. To you.,Jan
"Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?",Jim
No. I have a life.,Pam
"Interesting, what's that like?",Jim
You should try it sometime.,Pam
Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...,Jim
[laughs]... your problem.,Pam
Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.,Michael
"There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.",Michael
Gosh.,Jim
Yeah!,Michael
That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.,Jim
Really?,Michael
"Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?",Jim
"Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.",Jim
Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.,Dwight
"Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.",Jim
"OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?",Dwight
"Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.",Michael
"OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.",Dwight
You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.,Michael
"[to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.",Dwight
"Nope, you cannot use it.",Michael
"OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.",Dwight
Temporary workspace. You can use it.,Michael
Thank you.,Dwight
"If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.",Michael
What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.,Dwight
"In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, 'Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead.' Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.",Dwight
"There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.",Stanley
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",Pam
"[on phone] Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?",Michael
Where are you?,Pam
"Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?",Michael
"Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the...",Pam
"Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call.",Michael
No you're not.,Pam
"I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?",Michael
OK.,Pam
"Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.",Michael
Still no one calling.,Pam
"Dwight, what...",Pam
"Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.",Dwight
It says 'workspace'.,Jim
Same thing.,Dwight
"If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'?",Jim
"Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.",Dwight
You are not my superior.,Jim
"Oh gee, then why do I have an office?",Dwight
I thought it was a workspace?,Jim
OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?,Pam
Yes. And my decision in final.,Dwight
This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.,Pam
"Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.",Dwight
"You cut more than you had to, didn't you?",Jim
Sure.,Dwight
"Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?",Jim
Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.,Dwight
"OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.",Jim
"I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.",Dwight
Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?,Pam
So I can lower it.,Dwight
He literally won't come out of his office.,Oscar
He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.,Kevin
Kevin! That's inappropriate.,Angela
"Michael, can I talk to you?",Oscar
"Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?",Michael
"Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?",Meredith
"Ah, what? Which memo?",Michael
Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.,Pam
Is it a good plan?,Michael
It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.,Dwight
It's like a pay decrease.,Oscar
"Michael, he made huge cuts.",Pam
"Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?",Michael
"Yeah, you said...",Dwight
"No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?",Michael
I can handle that.,Dwight
"OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?",Michael
This is not good.,Oscar
It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?,Angela
What was that?,Oscar
You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.,Angela
What are you guys talking about?,Kevin
"Nothing, Kevin.",Angela
"Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, 'Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I...",Michael
"OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.",Dwight
"OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.",Jim
"OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.",Dwight
Workspace.,Jim
You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.,Michael
Where are you going?,Pam
"Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn't find the knob.",Michael
"So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.",Michael
"I don't know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?",Travel Agent
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...",Michael
Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.,Jim
I'm inventing new diseases.,Pam
"Oh, great.",Jim
"So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?",Pam
I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.,Jim
Nice.,Pam
Thank you.,Jim
"[on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.",Michael
You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It's not really a ride.,Man on Phone
Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.,Michael
"It goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.",Man on Phone
So it's not a free fall?,Michael
It's an industrial coal elevator.,Man on Phone
"Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?",Michael
"OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?",Michael
Damnit! Damnit Jim!,Dwight
"All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.",Dwight
What are you talking about?,Jim
"Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.",Dwight
"OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?",Jim
"Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.",Dwight
"You did this, didn't you?",Dwight
Absolutely not.,Jim
Yes you did.,Dwight
No I didn't.,Jim
"I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!",Dwight
Killer nanorobots?,Jim
It's an epidemic.,Pam
"The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] 'Count Choculitis'",Dwight
Sounds tough.,Jim
Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?,Dwight
Do you?,Jim
I think you need to confess...,Dwight
Mmm hmm.,Jim
...the fact...,Dwight
Yep.,Jim
What are you doing? Those are my keys.,Dwight
Good luck. [closes door and locks it],Jim
"Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]",Dwight
"[looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green...",Stanley
[answering phone] Jim Halpert.,Jim
Let me out.,Dwight
Who is this?,Jim
Let me out or you're fired.,Dwight
"No, you can't fire me.",Jim
Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.,Dwight
"OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.",Jim
"[on phone] Hey, Jim. It's Pam.",Pam
Hey Pam! How are you?,Jim
Jim! Open the door!,Dwight
"Good, how are you? Busy?",Pam
I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?,Jim
Jim!,Dwight
"Um, I'm not bothering you, am I?",Pam
"No, not at all.",Jim
You don't have anything you're doing?,Pam
I have nothing to do.,Jim
Jim!,Dwight
"Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything.",Pam
Jim!,Dwight
Oh yeah?,Jim
I might go to the mall.,Pam
The mall?,Jim
Jim!,Dwight
I need new shoes.,Pam
"Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?",Jim
Hello?,Jan
"Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.",Dwight
This is Jan.,Jan
"Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.",Dwight
Who is this?,Jan
Dwight Schrute.,Dwight
From sales?,Jan
Well...,Dwight
Where's Michael Scott?,Jan
He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.,Dwight
"Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?",Jan
"That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.",Dwight
Really?,Jan
Yeah.,Dwight
"OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.",Jan
"Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?",Dwight
No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.,Jan
"Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone]",Dwight
"Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! [laughs] Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.",Michael
Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...,Ryan
"Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.",Michael
"Oh, thanks.",Stanley
There you go.,Michael
"This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.",Stanley
"Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it.",Michael
Michael. Michael?,Dwight
"[under his breath] Oh, Christ.",Michael
"I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.",Dwight
"I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.",Dwight
What about confidentiality?,Stanley
"You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.",Dwight
"Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.",Meredith
I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?,Dwight
A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.,Meredith
"OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?",Dwight
That's a real thing.,Kevin
"Yeah, but no one here has it.",Dwight
Someone has it.,Kevin
Do you think we should go ?,Kevin
"I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.",Oscar
What is he doing?,Kevin
I don't know.,Oscar
Well?,Oscar
"Well, what? You could be referring to anything.",Michael
"OK, the health care plan.",Oscar
Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.,Pam
"Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?",Michael
I most certainly did not.,Dwight
"Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it? [looks at watch] Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.",Michael
What about the surprise?,Angela
"Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?",Michael
We all think you don't have a surprise.,Stanley
"All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!",Michael
"When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.",Michael
"[clapping hands] God, yeah... Ah! This...",Michael
"Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] 'Hi. I'm Mork from Ork.' Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.",Michael
"Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.",Dwight
"[heated discussion in the 'Dwight Schrute Workspace', door opens] I did not dismiss you.",Dwight
"Well, you have no right to ask those questions.",Oscar
You came into my office voluntarily.,Dwight
Because I don't want my benefits slashed.,Oscar
"Well, maybe they won't get slashed if you answer all my questions.",Dwight
I'm reporting you.,Oscar
"You know when ever a worker is promoted above their peers there's always going to be a little bit of jealousy. Uh, it's natural. And that's going to lead to goofing off and that's okay that's fine. As long as they are willing to suffer the consequences.",Dwight
Michael I need to talk to you.,Oscar
"Sorry, too busy can't even come to the door.",Michael
[opens door] Michael.,Oscar
"Yeah, no... [hurries to get up from chair]",Michael
"Michael, Michael I... [blinds rustle] ... inside.",Oscar
"You know what. I, um, I'm out the door. I'm going to a meeting. Pam, I'm headed out to another meeting. So see you later. Uh, here we go.",Michael
We stole Dwight's trashcan and she found some of his early attempts at his sign.,Pam
"Okay, here's uh, this is very simple. 'Dwight's Workspace,' nice.",Jim
Mmm hmm.,Pam
"Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. 'Schrute Space,' very medieval, very England. Um, this one's forceful, this one's very Dwight. 'Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,' it's good.",Jim
Mmm hmm.,Pam
"I really heard him on that. This one's interesting I'm not really sure what he meant by this. Um, 'Dwight Schrute Privates.' Tough to say.",Jim
Yeah.,Pam
"Okay, you know what, Dwight. What if you got a really serious disease like Ebola.",Jim
"Psssh, no.",Dwight
"Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak?",Jim
"Yeah. Well, have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable? 'Cause that guy couldn't get sick, just like me.",Dwight
Okay. Have you ever seen the movie Sixth Sense? Maybe you are already dead.,Jim
Unlikely.,Dwight
You promise these are confidential?,Pam
100%.,Dwight
Did you just mark on that?,Pam
"I don't think so, no.",Dwight
You made a 'P.',Pam
"Wrong. [walks away] Thank you Jim. Kevin. Stanley. [whispering] Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. You finished?",Dwight
"Oh, yeah. Here's the rest of them.",Oscar
That was... unauthorized.,Dwight
"Well, it is time to call in a little favor. A buddy of mine runs this tourist attraction, actually it's big. It's probably one of the most popular in the state. So...",Michael
Hello.,Man on Phone
"[on his cell phone] Hey, hey Craigers, my man! It is Michael Scott here. [silence] Dunder Mifflin, we supply your office paper.",Michael
"Oh, I think we already did our order this month.",Man on Phone
"No, no, no, no. No, actually to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, here's the deal. Um, trying to give the troops here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could bring them down to go on your big ride.",Michael
You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It's not really a ride.,Man on Phone
"Well, it says here that it's a 300ft drop.",Michael
"Well, it goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.",Man on Phone
So it's not a free fall?,Michael
It's an industrial coal elevator.,Man on Phone
"Uh, okay. So um, once you get down into the mine, what do you do? Is it like, uh... Do you have laser tag down there or something?",Michael
"No, you just look around. It's a historically preserved coal mine.",Man on Phone
That's it?,Michael
"Well, there's the adjacent Anthracite Heritage Museum. They got some really interesting old mining tools. There's also a photo mural exhibit. Uh, bat guano sculpture. [Michael hangs up cell phone]",Man on Phone
"Uh, he's a small client. They don't really buy much.",Michael
"Why do you want health care, Pam? Hmm? Why do you want it?",Dwight
In case I get sick.,Pam
"Why don't you just go ahead and use Roy's health care plan, huh?",Dwight
Because we're not married.,Pam
"But you're engaged. Aren't you and maybe you've set a date for the wedding, hmm? And because you know you're going to get married you don't have to take our health care plan seriously.",Dwight
We haven't set a date. [Dwight laughs],Pam
"You really expect me to believe you haven't set a date? I think you have. Sure Pam, sure. But you know what, you've been engaged for three years and I know you've set a date. And you know what else, I know you've got coverage under Roy and I know that you wrote down those fake diseases. Admit it. Admit it, Pam.",Dwight
"Shut up, Dwight.",Pam
You wrote down... I didn't give you permission to.. I didn't...,Dwight
I'm not talking to you anymore.,Pam
"Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.",Jim
You're doing the right thing. Go ahead. What 's your confession?,Dwight
Um...,Jim
Let it out.,Dwight
You're a jackass.,Jim
Okay. You wanna do this the hard way. We'll do this the hard way. You wrote down those fake diseases didn't you?,Dwight
No. Was that the hard way?,Jim
I know you did.,Dwight
"Well, then why are you wasting everybody else's time interrogating them?",Jim
"Well, because I want to know who wrote those diseases down.",Dwight
Right.,Jim
You want you to take this pen and this piece of paper and write this down. Write this down.,Dwight
Okay.,Jim
"I, Jim Halpert...",Dwight
"Wait, slow down.",Jim
...confess to health care fraud.,Dwight
"One second 'cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two? [Dwight sighs] One, right? 'Cause, 'cause of the show, it's one.",Jim
One word.,Dwight
"I've really learned from the greats. The great improvisers, Drew Carey, Ryan Stiles, uh, the Brady guy not so much. He's more the signing, Wayne Brady. Um, Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] 'Hi. I'm Mork from Ork.' Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo. [as Robin Williams] 'That's Good morning, Vietnam!' Well, hello to you. You know it would be... God. And you know what, sometimes when I'm watching somebody like um, like Jay Leno. He'll be half way through his step [snaps his fingers] And I will already be laughing at the punch line. He hasn't even gotten to it. He doesn't even know what it is it. So it's fun, you know it's fun having a mind that works like that. That is just a few steps ahead of... comedically ahead of like what's going on. Like I'll watch T.V. and I'll be watching a show and I will think, oh, I know someone's gonna walk in here right now and say something funny. And then they do. Or, um, I know they'll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down. There's going to be some sort of insult. And there is. You know, there's like, 'Oh you're... God your butt is fat.' And I knew it. I know it's like I knew they were going to say that. I knew they were gonna go there. Don't go there. Um, but other... You know it's like uh, you know Leno, um and Letterman, Carson, you know. Need I say more? No.",Michael
"Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.",Dwight
We're all going bowling!,Michael
Michael!?,Dwight
"Oh! God. Dwight, come on...",Michael
I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?,Dwight
There's no downsizing.,Michael
"I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?",Dwight
Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.,Michael
"Yeah, so I don't have to worry?",Dwight
"Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?",Michael
"But there's no downsizing, so just don't...",Michael
Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?,Dwight
"Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.",Michael
"It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, 'You're fired.' [as Donald Trump] 'You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed.' It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. [as Donald Trump] 'You're foir-ed.' I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, 'You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want.' But that's unrealistic, so...",Michael
"It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.",Dwight
Why'd you do this?,Stanley
"I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?",Dwight
"Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?",Michael
Who is it? Who's the birthday?,Michael
"Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up.",Pam
Next person on the...,Michael
Oh.,Pam
...calendar.,Michael
"Okay, umm... that would be Meredith.",Pam
"Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!",Michael
But it's not until next month.,Pam
"Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise.",Michael
You still want to have a party?,Pam
"Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!",Michael
"[grabs cell phone off desk] Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.",Michael
"Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it.",Phyllis
What?,Angela
"I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.",Phyllis
"No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.",Angela
Yeah?,Phyllis
What color do you guys think?,Angela
"Well, there's green, um, blue... yellow... red...",Phyllis
How about green?,Pam
I think green is kind of whoreish.,Angela
This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.,Pam
These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook!,Michael
"So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.",Michael
"Meredith's allergic to dairy, so...",Angela
"She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so...",Michael
It is... her birthday.,Pam
"Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?",Michael
"Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.",Dwight
"Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?",Dwight
"Absolutely, I do.",Jim
"Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected...",Dwight
"At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.",Jim
Did you get your tickets?,Dwight
To what?,Jim
The gun show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep],Dwight
"And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says 'No, Jim, here's a way.'",Jim
There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.,Dwight
An alliance?,Pam
Oh yeah.,Jim
What does that even mean?,Pam
"I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.",Jim
"Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.",Jim
"Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?",Dwight
Did you tell Pam about the alliance?,Dwight
What? No.,Jim
Just now.,Dwight
"What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.",Jim
"Right, that's good, good, pursue this.",Dwight
Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?,Jim
Mmm hmm.,Dwight
"But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.",Jim
Done.,Dwight
All right.,Jim
"[to the camera] Can you get her? She's right there. [camera zooms in on Meredith at here desk] That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day. [laughs] Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, 'Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers.' Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, 'Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael.' [pretends to vomit and laughs]",Michael
"They seem awfully chummy, don't you think?",Dwight
"Yeah, what do you think that's about?",Jim
Only one way to find out.,Dwight
I'm on it.,Jim
You are not going to believe this.,Jim
What? I believe it.,Dwight
"Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.",Jim
"I could tell, from the body language.",Dwight
"Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?",Jim
Italian.,Kevin
"Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...",Jim
Yeah.,Kevin
"Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.",Jim
"Good, let 'em. It helps our cause.",Dwight
"Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...",Jim
"Oh, they're forming an alliance",Dwight
I love their sandwiches.,Toby
I love their sandwiches too.,Jim
Their bread's really good.,Kevin
Their bread is very good.,Jim
Damn it. God!,Dwight
"OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.",Jim
God... Damn it! Why us?,Dwight
"Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong.",Jim
"[staring at birthday card] Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor.",Michael
"Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up?",Michael
"Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.",Oscar
"Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on?",Michael
"My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if...",Oscar
What?,Michael
Donate to the charity?,Oscar
"Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.",Michael
Thank you.,Oscar
"No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25.",Michael
That's... that's... that's very generous.,Oscar
"Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so...",Michael
"[whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?",Pam
"Sure, what's up?",Jim
"Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?",Pam
Oh no?,Jim
"Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, 'These people are my friends.' But he's all like, 'This is confidential. You can't tell anybody.' But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything.",Pam
"No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.",Jim
"OK, yeah.",Pam
Jackpot.,Dwight
That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.,Jim
"[looking at birthday card] Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.",Michael
"Hey, you wanted to see me?",Dwight
Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?,Michael
I don't think she'd be missed.,Dwight
"There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.",Michael
"Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.",Dwight
"I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.",Michael
She had a hysterectomy.,Dwight
[laughs] Which one is that again?,Michael
That's where they remove the uterus.,Dwight
"Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?",Michael
It could be kind of funny.,Dwight
"You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.",Michael
"OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.",Jim
"Oh my God, we have to be there.",Dwight
"I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.",Jim
"No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.",Dwight
What? What?,Jim
I know. I know exactly what to do.,Dwight
[gives Dwight a high five] Great.,Jim
"I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.",Dwight
"This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.",Dwight
Good.,Jim
Michael? Are you done yet?,Ryan
"Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.",Michael
"Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.",Jim
So tape it down.,Dwight
I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.,Jim
"Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box.",Dwight
"Thank you, thank you. OK.",Jim
Surprise!,Everybody
Oh! Surprise.,Meredith
"No, it's ah...",Angela
"It's surprise Meredith. One, two...",Michael
[tunelessly] Happy birthday to you.,Everybody
Find a key.,Michael
Happy birthday...,Everybody
"So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?",Jim
"No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone.",Dwight
Right... That's good.,Jim
"Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.",Dwight
"[singing] ... birthday, dear Meredith Happy birthday to you...",Everybody
And many more!,Michael
"Last year, five years ago...",Stanley
"You were surprised, weren't you?",Michael
Yes.,Meredith
"You looked freaked, man. We said 'Surprise.' You were, like, 'What?' 'What the hell's goin' on here?' Good cake. Why don't you have some?",Michael
"Uh, I can't. Um...",Meredith
Come on. A little bit.,Michael
I can't eat dairy.,Meredith
"Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good.",Michael
"Yeah, it makes me sick.",Meredith
"You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good.",Michael
He's in a box?,Pam
"Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.",Jim
"[on her cell phone] Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...",Pam
[box falls over] Oh.,Dwight
"Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.",Michael
"Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?",Jim
"Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time.",Michael
"Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.",Jim
Is Oscar around?,Michael
"I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so...",Michael
"Well, that's what a walk-a-thon is.",Oscar
I know...,Michael
"It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, 'However many dollars per mile.'",Oscar
Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...,Michael
I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.,Oscar
"No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?",Michael
Yeah.,Oscar
How many miles did he do last year?,Michael
"Last year, he walked 18 miles.",Oscar
Son of a bitch. That is impressive.,Michael
Happy Birthday. [gives Meredith her card],Pam
Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.,Michael
"Happy Bird-day' Um... 'Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.'",Meredith
[under his breath] I don't know about that.,Michael
"That was Stanley. 'Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam.'",Meredith
"[pretends to vomit] Huh! Thanks, downer.",Michael
"This is from Michael. 'Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'",Meredith
Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.,Michael
"No, I... I get it. It's funny.",Meredith
"[laughs] You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... 'Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.' 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?",Michael
You're right. You're right. Yes.,Meredith
"Divorce. Um... OK, 'Meredith is so old...'",Michael
How old is she?,Oscar
Everybody? If... could do it? 'Meredith is so old...',Michael
How old is she?,Everybody
"She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.'",Michael
"That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me.",Michael
"Uh, nice party Michael.",Oscar
"This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers? I think we could have done better than that.",Michael
"Phyllis wanted red, I didn't.",Angela
"Oh, boy... You...",Phyllis
"OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25.",Michael
Per mile.,Oscar
"Per mile, yes.",Michael
"When I retire, I... don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.",Michael
"A check for the kids, and for the team.",Michael
"I want it to be like... 'Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?' 'Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous.' 'Well, guess what, [whispering] that was Michael Scott.' 'But it was anonymous, how do you know?' 'Because I'm him.'",Michael
"Thank you, Michael.",Oscar
"Come here. [hugs Oscar and In a low voice] Don't cash that till Friday, OK?",Michael
Really? Today?,Toby
Yeah.,Ryan
"Oh, Happy Birthday.",Toby
Thanks.,Ryan
"Yeah, I could say something.",Toby
"No, don't. Don't do that.",Ryan
"OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.",Jim
"Oh, tell me, tell me.",Pam
OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no.,Jim
"But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.",Jim
[laughing] That's perfect!,Pam
If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...,Jim
[yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?,Roy
"No, no, dude, no.",Jim
"Hey, Hey!",Pam
"No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.",Jim
Come on.,Pam
"God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...",Jim
It's just office pranks.,Pam
"It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks.",Jim
[looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?,Roy
I have absolutely no idea.,Dwight
Come on.,Roy
"Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.",Dwight
"[With blonde hair] That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.",Dwight
"Good, excellent, and file sharing off and done. Security software, 128-bit encryption, firewalls. Get up, I'll install it on your computer.",Dwight
No thanks.,Jim
"Pssh, stupid. Identity theft happens all the time. I can become you like that. [snaps fingers] But no one can become me.",Dwight
"No one wants to be you, Dwight.",Jim
"Not true. And if they did, they couldn't because I'm password protected.",Dwight
Is your password Frodo?,Jim
No. [typing on keyboard],Dwight
Did you just change it to Gollum?,Jim
No. [typing on keyboard],Dwight
"[telephone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold please.",Pam
"All righty then, well I see you're going for the whole bored supermodel thing. 'Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. May I help you?' [takes a drag from an imaginary cigarette] Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.",Michael
I wasn't really going for anything.,Pam
"No, no. I get it, I get it, I get it. A child is born, 'Oh, oh-hum.' A beautiful sunset, 'No, I'll catch the next one.' Right? Unicorn walks into the office, 'Oh, do you have an appointment?' [laughs] Okay, look Pam this is not meant as a criticism, but let me tell you what you're doing wrong. You are the voice of this company, right? And when clients call and you're not smiling they can hear that in your voice. It is a real turnoff.",Michael
Are you being serious?,Pam
"Yes, I am, absolutely. So, the next call we get I'd like you to smile. I'd like to see a big smile.",Michael
Okay.,Pam
Okay. [waits for call],Michael
No one's calling.,Pam
"I know, somebody will. And we'll wait.",Michael
Sometimes there's a lot of time between the calls.,Pam
"I know, I know, we will wait.",Michael
Okay.,Pam
"We will wait for the call and you will smile. Let me try something, just while we're waiting.",Michael
Okay.,Pam
"Tell me if I'm smiling or not. [covers face with hands] Hi Pam, how are you? Was I smiling?",Michael
Yes.,Pam
"Okay, let me try this one. [covers face with hands] Hi Pam, how are you?",Michael
No.,Pam
I mean you can tell.,Michael
"Yeah, I could tell.",Pam
I wasn't smiling that time and they can tell too.,Michael
That was a good example.,Pam
"Thank you. All right, when we get a call I'll come back and you'll do the smile.",Michael
Okay. [telephone rings],Pam
Show time! It's show time!,Michael
"[smiling] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. One moment I'll transfer you.",Pam
Okay.,Michael
"[throwing away a banana, mayonnaise, and a sandwich from the refrigerator, smells the mayonnaise] God. [drinks from the milk carton and puts it back] Mmm.",Dwight
"[looks in the refrigerator] Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn't in the refrigerator. You wouldn't know anything about that would you?",Jim
It was rotting.,Dwight
It was not rotting.,Jim
Any employee may dispose a food item...,Dwight
"Stop. Dwight, stop.",Jim
...that risks contaminating the other food item. Read the official kitchen regulations memo.,Dwight
"Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it's not an official memo.",Jim
"Uh, uh, not my problem. Okay, this is a paper factory not a bacteria factory.",Dwight
"Dwight, it's not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing? [Dwight is tapping each of the bobble heads on his desk and making them bobble]",Jim
"Uh, if they don't bobble, what's the point?",Dwight
What is this?,Angela
My nephew does it every year. Anything you could give would be fantastic.,Oscar
"Okay, but I don't want to be put on a mailing list.",Angela
We need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.,Jim
God... Damn it! Why us?,Dwight
"Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. God, it's freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes.",Jim
[talking over Jim] Okay.,Dwight
You don't want to arouse suspicion.,Jim
I'll stay for ten.,Dwight
Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke. [Dwight pretends to smoke],Jim
"Do a poem for Meredith's birthday or uh, limerick. Limerick. Um, [knock on door] there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Come on in. Who had a big, smifflin.",Michael
"Hi, do you mind if I sign the card real quick?",Toby
"No, not at all come on in. [Toby signing the birthday card] No, no. You can't. No, red hair is my area. We have it on tape, so...",Michael
It's just a birthday card.,Toby
"I was going to put that in my message, Toby. All right? So just cross it off. Cross it off, now. [Toby writes on birthday card] What are you doing? Oh come on, you're ruining it. Toby, come on. Just, look at that. That's wrecked. Ass. Get some white out.",Michael
There's some right there.,Toby
"That's my white out. Get your own white out. Just... what's the matter with you? God. [Toby leaves] Okay, um, there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Who had a big, puttifflin. [thinking out loud] Mifflin, spifflin.",Michael
"Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life.",Jim
Hey.,Dwight
Hey.,Michael
You wanted to see me?,Dwight
"Uh, yeah. What do you know about Meredith?",Michael
I don't think she'd be missed.,Dwight
"There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.",Michael
"Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.",Dwight
"I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.",Michael
She had a hysterectomy.,Dwight
Which one is that again?,Michael
That's where they remove the uterus.,Dwight
"Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny here, okay. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?",Michael
It could be kind of funny.,Dwight
"[sighs] Come up with a joke that I can use, okay?",Michael
Mmm-hmm.,Dwight
Help me out here.,Michael
"Okay. Hey Meredith, where's your uterus?",Dwight
"No, not a uterus joke Dwight. Please. Something useable. A joke.",Michael
"If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity? [cut to Jim holding his hands up like a champion]",Dwight
What?,Michael
From the downsizing.,Dwight
"There's not going to be downsizing, Dwight. You know what, I am on a deadline here and just, okay. Thanks. Thanks for your help. I'm... I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. [Dwight leaves] Thanks for coming in, that's always... Always helpful when I give him a call. Call him in.",Michael
"Meredith. Oh, oh man, ah gosh. I can't remember why I came over here. Ha, ha.",Michael
I hate that.,Meredith
"I know. Ugh, that is so annoying. [makes fart noise] Brain fart. By the way, do you remember any funny interactions we may have had recently that I've forgotten about? Just, you know we bumped into each and you said, 'Brr, brr.' And I went, 'Argh, Argh.' You know? Anything? [shakes her head 'no'] Well, if you think of something, let me know. 'Cause I like to know. 'Cause I'm going crazy.",Michael
"Oscar, uh for future reference just think you should know, that you should probably make it clear that your nephew is doing the walkathon and that he doesn't actually have cerebral palsy. Okay.",Michael
I never suggested...,Oscar
"No, no. I know you didn't intend to, but I just I got the idea and I, uh, I just don't it has a lot of ethical merit to make people think something. You know? And then prey on their emotions.",Michael
"Michael, if I gave you...",Oscar
"No, hey it's just kinda uncool, okay? I, just... Play fair, you know, play fair.",Michael
Thank you.,Oscar
Thank you.,Michael
Okay.,Oscar
"Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'",Meredith
Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.,Michael
"No, I...I get it. It's funny.",Meredith
"[laughs] You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, Okay, here's a good one. Um...'Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.' 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?",Michael
You're right. You're right. Yes.,Meredith
"Divorce. Um... Okay, 'Meredith is so old...'",Michael

"All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. [Ryan holds up his bag] Very good. Excellent, excellent.",Michael
Michael!,Dwight
"Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, 'This might be kinda fun.' And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.",Michael
"Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.",Michael
"Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.",Dwight
"No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.",Michael
"Oh, please.",Dwight
[to camera] When I let him come to my pick-up game...,Michael
I apologized for that.,Dwight
[to Dwight] I vouched for you.,Michael
"Michael, I...",Dwight
"I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.",Michael
I can handle that.,Dwight
"Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that.",Michael
And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.,Dwight
Yes it is. Assistant to the regional manager.,Michael
[to camera] Same thing.,Dwight
"No, it's not. It's lower, so...",Michael
It's close.,Dwight
"So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.",Dwight
"God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?",Jim
Keep me out of it.,Phyllis
"My fiance has plans for us this Saturday. So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.",Pam
"All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right.",Michael
"Fine, don't worry about that.",Ryan
"And here we have 'Mister Roger's Neighborhood.' Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs.",Michael
What's up?,Lonny

Darryl Rogers?,Ryan
"Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.",Darryl
"[laughs] And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.",Michael
"Yeah, yeah.",Ryan
"You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job! Rapport!",Michael
"[on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years.",Pam
"Pam gets a little down. Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.",Jim
"So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on.",Michael
We're loading at one.,Darryl
"Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me.",Michael
"No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time.",Darryl
"Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way. [clucking and dancing like a chicken]",Michael
"All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.",Darryl
"All right, see you at one.",Michael
Are we ready for the game?,Michael
[half-heartedly] Yeah.,Everybody

Gimli.,Dwight
Nerd. That is why you're not on the team.,Michael
Just trying to be helpful.,Dwight

That's him.,Jim
"OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.",Michael
I'm sorry?,Stanley
"Um, what do you play? Center?",Michael

What's that supposed to mean?,Stanley
"Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that.",Michael
"Uh, I heard it.",Jim
"Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time.",Michael
I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.,Phyllis
"[ignores Phyllis)] Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.",Michael
"But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch?",Ryan

Please don't throw garbage at me.,Pam
"Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?",Michael
"I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.",Pam
"I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...",Jim
"Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.",Michael
Maybe Angela would cheerlead.,Pam
"Oh, yeah right.",Michael
I'll do it.,Phyllis
"Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good.",Michael
"Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?",Michael
Just getting a tea bag.,Darryl
"Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!",Michael
Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.,Darryl

"No, that's not as much fun. You know what?",Darryl
What?,Michael
You're on.,Darryl

"Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake.",Pam
I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.,Jim
"Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let's bring it in! Here we go! OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, you're fired. That's a joke. OK, let's do it.",Michael

"When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. It's gone, I'm in the zone.",Michael
[misses another shot] What is wrong with me today?!,Michael
"Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine. What's Dunder Mifflin? I've never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um... well, that's probably gonna happen, actually.",Michael
"Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut! [Michael looks away and misses Jim's pass] Whoa!",Michael
My bad.,Jim

"You know what? Dwight, Dwight...",Michael
"Football is like rock and roll, it's just bam-bam-boo... And basketball is like jazz, you know? You're kind of... Dupee-doo, dupee-do. It's all downbeat, it's in the pocket, it's like... [singing] Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah...",Michael
"[singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter...",Michael

"Block, block, block!",Darryl
He's afraid of you now.,Madge
"[Jim makes a shot after pushing off Roy] Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?",Michael
[Jim pushes Roy to the ground and makes another shot] Yes!,Michael
What the hell man?,Roy
Take it easy.,Jim

"Oh, that hurts.",Michael
"Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.",Worker
"What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?",Michael
Take your shot man!,Darryl
"No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.",Michael
No it wasn't.,Worker
"[mocking voice] Yes, it was. You know what, I'm just being fair.",Michael
"Oh, really? No, I just put my arm up...",Worker
"Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly.",Michael
This is a cold pack...,Angela
"Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. [bag explodes]",Dwight
Thanks Dwight.,Michael
"Wait, what does that mean? What is it, a tie? What's going on?",Lonny
"Well, let's just say whoever was ahead won.",Michael

"So what's that? We're coming in on Monday, right?",Lonny
"Hey, hey...",Michael
Monday?,Lonny
"[laughing] You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word.",Michael
"[to Pam] ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.",Jim
Mmm-hmm.,Pam

"Hey, what a game, huh? What a game.",Michael
What time do we have to come in?,Oscar
"Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.",Michael
The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don't win. But we did because we were ahead.,Michael
"[slams palms on desk] Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.",Michael

"Michael, could I talk to you for a second, please?",Dwight
Uh...,Michael
In your office? [in Michael's office] You know that is why you have an assistant regional manager.,Dwight
"Yes, yes. Assistant to the regional manager.",Michael
[to camera] Same thing.,Dwight
"No, it's not. It's lower.",Michael
It's close.,Dwight
What was that?,Michael
What?,Dwight
That look?,Michael
What look?,Dwight
"Like trying to find the camera, to give the camera a look. Okay, we're done. Is that your stomach? I keep hearing somebody's stomach. [whispers] God.",Michael
"So, you uh, see the Sixers game last night?",Michael
Yeah.,Darryl
[howls like a wolf] Oww whoo whoo! The Answer was on fire!,Michael
"Iverson. Yeah, always man. It's very important.",Darryl
"Oh, man! Man I tell ya. Iverson has maybe got me beat by like 20 pounds, 3 inches. [makes 'pop' noise with his mouth]",Michael
What? Iverson's not fat.,Roy
"No, neither am I. We both look good.",Michael
"Do I have a nickname on the court, um? Well, The Answer would be nice, but it's taken. So, uh, probably The Question. The Answer dishes to The Question. The Question back to The Answer. Answer over to The Question. The Answer, whew, [makes shooting motion] three points. The Question, whew, whew, [makes shooting motion] six points. Nothing but net. Question, who's the best player in the league? Answer, The Question. Or the Drunkmeister.",Michael
I can't work Saturday.,Kevin
"Please, have a seat. [Kevin sits down] Okay, why not?",Dwight
I'm in a band.,Kevin
Marching or garage?,Dwight
It's a Steve Miller Tribute Band.,Kevin
I tell you what. You give me a tape of your band and a tape of the Steve Miller Band and I'll get back to you. That is all.,Dwight
[on the phone] Mello.,Todd Packer
Packer. Pac-man.,Michael
Whoa. Hey.,Packer
Pac-man [imitating the noises of the video game Pac-man eating dots],Michael
"[on the phone] Is this Michael Scott? My secret lover. My intercom, I told you never to call me here. Never! [Michael's laughing]",Todd Packer
"I'm not your lover! I'm am not Michael Scott, I am Dr. Bergerstein. Your proctologist.",Michael
[on the phone] Bergerstein!,Todd Packer
"Ah, yes. Ah. [laughs]",Michael
[on the phone] Bergerstein!,Todd Packer
"It's not a Jewish joke, so don't worry.",Michael
[on the phone] I want my money back you greedy Hebrew. Bergerstein!,Todd Packer
"[clears throat] No, hey, hey , hey. You know what I just wanted to remind you about the game today. One 'o clock. Big game, big game.",Michael
[sounds sick on the phone] I can't make it.,Todd Packer
"Mmm. No, you said you could man. We're counting on ya. You know you're playing point guard.",Michael
[on the phone] I... I'm not coming.,Todd Packer
"No. Hey... I mean, although it's just for fun, you know we want... I was counting on you man.",Michael
"[on the phone] Oh, God! Stop whining. You know, you only come to the pick up game once a year. You little bitch. [Michael picks up phone, takes it off speakerphone] All right, yup. Hey, okay. No problem, you know, best you can do. Hey, you know. Hey, nice talking to you too. All right take care. [sighs] Michael Scoot. That's funny. He's a good friend.",Todd Packer
[eating Tootsie Rolls from Angela's candy on her desk] Mmm. Good. Mmm.,Dwight
They're one per person. [points to sign 'Please take one!!],Angela
"Would you like to have a vacation this year? That's what I thought. [continues eating Tootsie Rolls] Mmm, delicious.",Dwight
"Well, I though we were saving money for the wedding, but apparently Roy thought it was more important to buy two WaveRunners. I don't really ever get to use the other WaveRunner that's supposed to be mine because his brother uses it and they race.",Pam
"Jim, you're the new schedule guy, huh?",Dwight
"I'm trying, yup.",Jim
"Yeah, I hear that. You know what? This little baby might come in handy.",Dwight
"Great, thanks.",Jim
On one condition. You...,Dwight
Forget it. It's just a dry erase board.,Jim
"Oh, no it's not. Okay, check it out.",Dwight
"Okay, that's insanely complicated and the first thing I'm going to do is erase it.",Jim
"No, you're not because I spent hours on it.",Dwight
"Well, then keep it.",Jim
"Okay, I will. Okay, fine. You'll be back.",Dwight
"[misses a free throw badly] I... I think you can play. Like you could when you were a kid. I think you can never give up the play. Because if people stop playing, then they stop living. It's like a shark. If a shark stops playing he stops living. And sharks are very playful creatures.",Michael
"[Dwight holds the first aid kit up] I'm the safety officer, not you.",Angela
"Isn't that crazy? I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Lackawanna County says that it's okay for me to perform CPR, but for Michael my lips aren't qualified enough for his perfect little face. It's nuts.",Dwight
Is that really necessary?,Angela
[wearing a face guard] I've almost had my nose broken a dozen times.,Dwight
"You know what. I think most basketball movies are great movies. Because it's a great subject. There's one about a little kid who, um, joins a professional basketball team and he's really, really good and he can dunk and he's like 3 feet tall. And he can dunk the ball. That, oh, I love that movie. That movie kind of, that movie makes me cry. I don't like to cry on camera, but that movie makes me cry. Um, because it touches a cord in me about hoops. [Michael's free throw is really short] Short, short, short! And basketball is like jazz, you know. To like pertipify it there's a jazz musician, a guy, you know... if you know jazz you know who I mean. He's uh, God what was his name? Um, he plays one of those curly horns, like those really shiny curly horns that's used in jazz a lot.",Michael
[back to the basketball game] Let's go Lonny.,Warehouse Worker
"[Michael steals the ball] Yeah, Michael. Go Michael. [makes shot]",Jim
Yes!,Dwight
"Birdie. He's not the guy with the cheeks. Kenny G. Is... if you knew jazz, you'd know who I mean. Kenny G. God. Glad I remembered that. Jazz people know who he is.",Michael
"[back to the basketball game] Dwight, pass it to Jim! Pass it to Ryan!",Michael
"Oh, my ankle!",Stanley
"Stanley, gotta play hurt.",Michael
"Oh, actually no I don't Michael.",Stanley
"I just want you know, you've been a big disappointment to me today, okay.",Michael
[in pain] Oh. Go away.,Stanley
"I'm in. I'm in. Here we go. [Lonny gets around Michael to score and he ends up in front of Phyllis] Zone, Phyllis! We're playing zone!",Michael
[Michael hits a half court shot] Ah! [clapping],Everybody
Yes! Yes! All right. We got game!,Michael
Are you listening to me Michael?,Jan
Affirmative.,Michael
What did I just say?,Jan
"You just said, let me uh... check my notes. You just said...",Michael
Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales.,Jan
"Hey, hey how is Alan? Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!",Michael
I'm not going to do that Michael.,Jan
Okay,Michael
We've created an incentive program to increase sales.,Jan
"Uh, huh.",Michael
At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.,Jan
"Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That's cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?",Michael
"Uh, yes. Yes you can.",Jan
"Um, question: Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that've been promoted to...",Michael
"No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.",Jan
I didn't mean me!,Michael
"Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.",Michael
Sex.,Dwight
It's illegal. Can't do that. Next best thing.,Michael
Torture.,Dwight
"Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That's just stupid.",Michael
"Uh, Michael?",Pam
Pam!,Michael
"Hey, there's a...",Pam
Burger with cheese!,Michael
There's a person here...,Pam
And fries!,Michael
There's...,Pam
And shake! What? Go ahead.,Michael
There's a person here who wants to sell handbags.,Pam
"No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction.",Michael
"Okay, I told her you'd talk to her.",Pam
"Pam. Pam. Come on, I'm busy. So just tell her to go away.",Michael
Okay.,Pam
"[exhales loudly, looks out window and sees Katy] Oooh, alright I'll talk to her.",Michael
This one is hand embroidered.,Katy
"All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse.",Michael
Cocks in the henhouse.,Dwight
"Don't say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass?",Michael
Katy.,Katy
"Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0.",Michael
"Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I'm against violence in the workplace.",Michael
So am I.,Dwight
Nobody cares what you think.,Michael
Doesn't matter.,Dwight
"So uh, you know what? I usually don't allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It's yours. All day.",Michael
"Wow, thanks.",Katy
There's an HR meeting in there at 11:30.,Pam
"Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.",Michael
"I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating.",Michael
"This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall. [knocks on wall] used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be.",Michael
"So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here.",Michael
I guess a cup of coffee would be great.,Katy
"Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks.",Michael
What?,Katy
"It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here.",Michael
Regular coffee is fine.,Katy
"Nah, it's not. it's spppplllibbb",Michael
No really it is.,Katy
"No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day. So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?",Michael
Bring it on.,Katy
"Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right.",Michael
So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?,Kevin
No.,Pam
She's prettier than you though.,Kevin
"That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin.",Pam
[nods],Kevin
So do you like the periwinkle and the purples?,Katy
"The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.",Dwight
[handing Katy a mug of coffee] There ya go. Nice steaming cup o'joe.,Michael
Thank you.,Katy
"I have an idea. Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?",Michael
"Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um...",Katy
"Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?",Michael
I'm installing File Share on all the computers.,Ryan
"Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?",Michael
"You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy.",Michael
I'm on the phone.,Oscar
Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.,Michael
That was on Sesame Street.,Katy
I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here?,Michael
"No, I don't believe that.",Katy
"I know, it's unbelievable.",Michael
"It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with.",Pam
"Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby.",Michael
Hi,Katy
"Hi, nice to meet you.",Toby
"Toby, Katy.",Michael
"Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O'Hara?",Toby
Yeah.,Katy
"Yeah, me too.",Toby
Cool. What year were you there?,Katy
Eighty-nine.,Toby
"Toby's divorced. He uh, guh recently, right?",Michael
Yeah.,Toby
"You and your wife, and you have kids.",Michael
A girl.,Toby
Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too?,Michael
[looks resigned],Toby
I should probably get back to my table.,Katy
"Okay. Alright. Cool. See ya in a bit. [looks at picture on Toby's desk] Oh, she's cute. Cutie-pie. Back to work.",Michael
"I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike.",Michael
"Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh?",Roy
"Cute, sure, yeah.",Jim
Why don't you get on that?,Roy
She's not really my type.,Jim
What are you gay?,Roy
"Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope.",Jim
What is your type?,Kevin
"[glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.",Jim
That's disgusting.,Roy
Stay away from my mom.,Kevin
"Too late, Kev.",Jim
"[Katy walks through breakroom] Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam.",Roy
"We're not dating, we're engaged.",Pam
"Engaged, yeah.",Roy
"Pam and I are good buddies. I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.",Jim
She'd be perfect for you.,Jim
Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.,Dwight
"So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager.",Jim
Assistant to the Regional Manager.,Dwight
"Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.",Jim
That's true.,Dwight
"Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.",Jim
True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.,Dwight
It's all gold.,Jim
"Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know? They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.",Katy
"Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her. If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.",Jim
What's that?,Dwight
You buy a purse.,Jim
I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.,Dwight
"Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?",Jim
No.,Dwight
"Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them.",Jim
Like those?,Dwight
"Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.",Jim
"Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...",Dwight
No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.,Jim
"Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.",Jim
[smiles],Pam
"[mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?",Jim
"[mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.",Pam
"Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.",Jim
Oh!,Pam
Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.,Jim
Oh...,Pam
"I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball. Oh, how much?",Jim
"Oh, God. It's sad. It's so sad.",Pam
"[whispering] Here he comes, shhh...",Jim
[gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good.,Jim
[smiles in agreement],Pam
He did pick a good one.,Jim
You're horrible.,Pam
This one's really good for a hot date.,Katy
"Yeah, what's that?",Pam
[laughs],Katy
I'm engaged. So...,Pam
Congratulations. You need a hot date more than anyone.,Katy
"I wished, right?",Pam
"Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right? [to Katy] So how's that uh, coffee from earlier?",Michael
Good.,Katy
"Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing. So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?",Michael
[whispers] Sorry.,Katy
Busted.,Michael
[to Pam] Come back...,Katy
"Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something. I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.",Michael
Is that from Starbucks?,Katy
Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.,Michael
Wow. Is that for the office?,Katy
"Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!",Michael
I wouldn't think of it.,Katy
"Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!",Michael
"[Katy reading text message on her phone] Oh the rotating um, steam wand. [Katy looks annoyed] What? What's the matter?",Michael
"Oh, nothing. My ride just bailed on me.",Katy
"Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...?",Michael
"Oh no, it's um...",Katy
Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.,Michael

"Seriously. No, really.",Michael
No. I really don't want to inconvenience you.,Katy
"God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp.",Michael

"Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay.",Katy
Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. Five o'clock sharp. I will give you and your purses a ride home.,Michael
Okay. Cool.,Katy
Excellent.,Michael
Cool.,Katy
"Great. Cool. Cool. [takes deep breath - looks at camera] Yeah, okay.",Michael
I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..,Michael
It's actually better this way.,Dwight
No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---,Michael
Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...,Dwight
"No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not.",Michael
"Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.",Dwight
But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.,Michael
What?,Dwight
She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.,Michael
Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?,Dwight
"Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...",Michael
"Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?",Dwight
No. I cannot promise you that.,Michael
"You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?",Dwight
"Listen, Dwight.",Michael
Do you love her?,Dwight
"[laughs] Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel. [Dwight sadly looks away]",Michael
"I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that.",Katy
Hmmm...,Stanley
Espresso?,Michael
"Oh, thank you.",Katy
You're welcome. Thank you. Hmmm-hmm-hmm.,Michael
Is that from the machine that was in your office?,Stanley
Ummm-hmmm...,Michael
I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.,Stanley
Very easy to clean.,Michael
"Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right? [laughs]",Michael
Did we get any mail?,Michael
"Yeah, I gave it to you.",Pam
"Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and...",Michael
"So, can I..? [points to the door]",Pam
"Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?",Michael
A futon?,Jim
[nods],Pam
He's a grown man,Jim
That's what he said.,Pam
"That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]",Jim
What's up?,Roy
[not looking at Roy] Hi.,Pam
Are you still mad at me?,Roy
Roy...,Pam

"Huh? huh? Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding.",Roy
"[breathless] Stop, I can't breathe.",Pam
I was just kidding. You know I didn't mean it. I can't...,Roy
Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me. We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.,Pam
You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet?,Katy
I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.,Angela
"Oh no, it's fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It's really uh, kind of festive. It's got a lot of personality.",Katy
"Yeah, uh no.",Angela
"Hey, how's it going? Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?",Dwight
I don't think so I'm really busy.,Katy
It will just take a second.,Dwight
I can't.,Katy
Just for a minute.,Dwight
I really can't.,Katy
Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.,Dwight

"Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin.",Michael
Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water],Ryan
No.,Michael
What about this bottle of power drink?,Ryan
"Uh, what flavor?",Michael
Blue.,Ryan
Blue's not a flavor.,Michael
It says flavor: Blue Blast.,Ryan
"Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you.",Michael

Okay.,Katy
"What, stop! Whoa! That's my Drakkar Noir.",Michael

"That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?",Jim
Great.,Pam
Okay.,Jim
"Okay, I'm gonna head back.",Pam
Alright.,Jim
"I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. [laughs] I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right? I don't know.",Michael
Sure you don't want me to help you with that? Cause I can grab that no problem.,Michael
"Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you.",Katy
"See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim.",Michael
"Goodnight, Michael.",Jim
Where you going?,Michael
"I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?",Jim

"Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.",Michael
I got this. [taking Katy's bag from Michael],Jim

"You too, have a good night.",Michael
You got that?,Katy
"Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.",Jim
Good. Here. Squeeze it inside.,Katy
"Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?",Jim
Why?,Katy
"This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.",Jim
It's a... it's a very nice car.,Katy
You're not going to freak out?,Jim
"Do I have a special someone? Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time. Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.",Michael
"The perfect girl for me would be Konikotaka. She has the most amazing story. She was orphaned at age 10 when both her parents were assassinated, and she was taken in by a wealthy, but very cruel, businessman. So she practiced aikido in secret for years until she could avenge the death of her parents. She's also a survivor of monster rape.",Dwight
This is really well made. Good stitching. Excellent fabric. [shakes the purse from side to side by it's handle] You sell a lot of these?,Dwight
"It's very popular, yeah.",Katy
I knew it. Is it waterproof?,Dwight
I'm not sure. It's faux snakeskin.,Katy
"Snakes are waterproof. So, I'm betting that it's waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?",Dwight
No.,Katy
Cause I could look it up real easily.,Dwight
"You're really into reptiles, huh?",Katy
My belt's made out of alligator. Check it out. [lifts shirt],Dwight
"Oh, um, it's okay.",Katy
"Dwight. Dwight. Dwight! Okay, that's it. Keep it in your pants.",Michael
I was just showing her my belt.,Dwight
"Well, don't do that. Where are your glasses?",Michael
I....,Dwight
He wears glasses. Did you know that?,Michael
Not all the time.,Dwight
"Well, now suddenly he can see. [laughs] Okay, take off. See ya. Bye-bye. [gives coffee to Katy] There you go steaming hot cup of joe.",Michael
Thank you.,Katy
"Oh, I know your hero. Yeah, saving you from Animal Planet Jack over there. [laughs]",Michael
"Ha. Yeah, asks a lot of questions.",Katy
"Yeah, yeah he is the worst.",Michael
"What's the um, saying, 'once their laughing they're... that's... Once they're laughing that's 50 percent of them being horizontal. So, not that I'm just... Not that that's my... that's what I'm trying to do, but I think it helps kind of melts the ice. Breaks the ice, melts... Breaks the ice and melts them. Melts their hearts.",Michael
"Thank you, Al Gore... for the Internet. Can send messages from one side the global to the other in the blink of an eye. Can you believe we couldn't do that ten years ago?",Michael
We could do that ten years ago.,Katy
"Right, but 20 years ago we couldn't and that is amazing. Here's Toby from Human Resources. This is Katy. Toby, Katy.",Michael
Hi.,Toby
Hi.,Katy
"Hey, did you go to Bishop Ohara?",Toby

"[talking over Toby and Katy] Toby's divorced. God, that's hard. That really ripped you up. She got the kids right? That'll damage ya. Sorry man. That's uh, that's a bad one. How much you paying her? What can, you can't even afford anything now, right? You're all right though, right? Don't ask me for a raise. [laughs] Cup of Soup's a good idea though. That'll... that's a good budgetary thing to do.",Michael
It's just a snack.,Toby
"Well, they're good snacks. They're good food, good meals, good lunch. Roman noodles are good too. You still sleepin' in the car?",Michael
No.,Toby
Cause he slept in the car a couple times.,Michael
Just the once.,Toby
"Are you still taking the antidepressants? 'Cause it was a good idea. 'Cause it'll help. It'll help, man.",Michael
I'm gonna go back to my table.,Katy
Okay. I'll see you in a bit. [whispering] She's pretty cute isn't she? See you in a bit.,Michael
I mean whatever one you want.,Ryan
"Um, I like that one I think. [Ryan hands her a purse]",Kelly
"Yeah, I mean, it looks real good, probably.",Ryan
You know Michael's been talking to her too.,Pam
"Oh, really?",Jim
What do you think his chances are?,Pam
"Well, Pam I'm not gonna lie to you, he's chances are none. Um, he's 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is 'Mambo #5.' So...",Jim
[laughs] I like that song.,Pam
"I don't know though. I mean, you know that was a hit.",Jim
[laughs] 10 years ago.,Pam
"Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.",Jim
Went well?,Jim
I think it did.,Dwight
"You know what, just in case she's looking you should put some stuff in it.",Jim
Seriously?,Dwight
Anything. [Dwight begins to fill his new purse] Good. Yup.,Jim
What else?,Dwight
"Post-it Notes. Wow, that purse holds a lot.",Jim
It's a mini-briefcase.,Dwight
"Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great. [Dwight throws the purse over his right shoulder and gets back to work]",Jim
Do you like Steve Miller?,Kevin
No.,Katy
Cause I'm in a Steve Miller Tribute... Tribute Band.,Kevin
"Hey, Dwight. I need your stapler.",Jim
It's in my purse.,Dwight
"Oh, great thanks.",Jim
"Let me describe the perfect date. I take her out to a nice dinner. She looks amazing. Some guy tries to hit on her. Uh, now he wants to fight. So I grab him. I throw him into a jukebox. Then the other ninja's got a knife. He comes at me. We grapple. I turn his knife on him. Blood on the dance floor. She's scared now, I take her home. I'm holding her in my arms. I reach in for a kiss. I hear something in the leaves. I flip her around. She gets a poison arrow right in her back. She was in on it the whole time. But, I knew.",Dwight
"All right. That's looking good. Hey um, Ryan do you have any music I can borrow.",Michael
What kind do you like?,Ryan
"Ah, I know, everything really. I love it all. I love music.",Michael
"Okay, do you like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock?",Ryan
"Yes, I love both of those so much. A lot of 'em.",Michael
Okay. Do you like The Strokes?,Ryan
Mmm hmm. I like 'em.,Michael
Do you like The Hives?,Ryan

"Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those.",Ryan
"Cool, so maybe hook me up with some Fleebulls and some Hive.",Michael
Absolutely.,Ryan
All right. This is gonna be good.,Michael
"Hi, here you can have this. [Dwight gives Kelly his purse] It's a mini-briefcase, but you can use it as a purse.",Dwight
"Uh, thank you.",Kelly
"Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. [holds up a trophy of a business man] And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, 'Hey, did you get an award?' And the neighbor will say, 'No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me.' Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So...",Michael
"So, you ready for the... the Dundies?",Jim
Ugh...,Pam
"You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.",Pam
[in a Fat Albert voice] Hey hey hey! It's Fat Halpert.,Michael
What?,Jim
[in Fat Albert voice] Fat Halpert. [in normal voice] Jim Halpert.,Michael
"So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera?",Michael
"Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.",Jim
"Oh, that's a good idea.",Michael
Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.,Dwight
Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.,Michael
"T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say 'Don't go there' but that's... lame.",Michael
"And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling.",Michael
"I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.",Stanley
"Oh, no you di-int.",Michael
I think I did.,Stanley
W-why did you...,Michael
"Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time. We ran out last year, remember?",Stanley
"Yes we should. I... you know what? I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, [turns to Kevin] someone had eaten all of them.",Michael
[in video] To Oscar Martinez it's the 'Show Me the Money' award! Yeah!,Michael
Michael has taped,Pam
[in video] That's supposed to be confidential.,Oscar
"[in video] He has the award-ah! ...it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!",Michael
"[singing along to tune on video] A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing...",Michael
[in video]...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere...,Michael
"Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great.",Pam
"[on video] ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of...",Michael
It was you.,Kelly
Live and learn.,Phyllis
[quietly laughing] It wasn't. I swear.,Pam
"Yeah, it was.",Kelly
"So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.",Dwight
"We're not laughing at you, Dwight.",Pam
So who are we laughing at?,Dwight
"Um, just something somebody wrote.",Pam
Who? Dave Barry?,Dwight
"[laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall.",Kelly
What is it? Who wrote it?,Dwight
"Um, it's kind of private.",Pam
[whispering] It's about Michael.,Phyllis
"That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.",Dwight
"Okay, now I'm laughing at you.",Pam
"[talking to the speakerphone] Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?",Michael
"[on speaker phone] It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.",Jan
"Well, you could take the bus. You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home.",Michael
No.,Jan
"Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So...",Michael
"No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this.",Jan
Um...,Michael
[to camera] Could you...?,Michael
Are you there Michael?,Jan
"Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.",Michael
"Um, what, ah, what is, I mean...",Michael
"...come on, Jan!",Michael
You're dropping an A-Bomb on me here.,Michael
Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?,Jan
"Well, yeah, I mean, what is...",Michael
You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.,Jan
No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...,Michael
And you had a luau....,Jan
...it happens once every billion years.,Michael
And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.,Jan
"Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N.",Michael
"Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense.",Jan
"Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.",Michael
"This is a little character I like to do [places a green turban with a yellow feather on his head], it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson's classic characters. [puts an envelope to his head] Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse. [tears open envelope and pulls out card] 'Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin.' Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan and it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk.",Michael
"Dwight, get out of here!!",Phyllis
"No, no, no, no...",Dwight
What were you doing in the ladies room?!,Phyllis
"...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.",Dwight
Why were you peering over the stalls?!,Phyllis
"No, why were you in there?!",Dwight
You are a pervert!,Phyllis
What were you doing in there?,Dwight
"You, are, a pervert!",Phyllis
I am not.,Dwight
[in video] The Dundie award for 'Longest Engagement' goes to Pam Beesley.,Michael
"Pam, everybody! [starts clapping]",Michael
"Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting.",Michael
[on video] Yes.,Roy
"[on video] Thank you Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say, on Pam's behalf?",Michael
"[on video] Ah, w-we'll see you next year.",Roy
"[on video] Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!",Michael
"I'm not changing that, it's the best one.",Michael
"No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, 'world's longest engagement', um, we're all expecting it, you know?",Jim
"That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier.",Michael
Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.,Jim
"Oh, [taking it to heart] lazy. Uh huh.",Michael
"Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.",Dwight
You're taking away our bathroom?,Pam
We are going to have two men's rooms.,Dwight
But where would we...go?,Phyllis
Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to...,Dwight
Michael...,Pam
Yes.,Michael
...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.,Pam
"Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now.",Michael
"Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions...",Dwight
"Just don't, don't talk-",Michael
...for people's behavior.,Dwight
Don't talk-,Michael
And it's-,Dwight
Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!!,Michael
"Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.",Michael
[with a small fist pump] Yes!,Dwight
"Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever.",Michael
[clapping] Best Dundies ever.,Dwight
Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.,Dwight
"Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. [points] Devon!",Dwight
"The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you. You're just a name and number and no one even says hello.' [to Ryan] Card!",Michael
"The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.",Oscar
You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-',Michael
The waitress tripped on the cord.,Dwight
"Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards. [takes off sweater to reveal tuxedo] I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!",Michael
"[to waitress] Oh, just put these on the group tab.",Kevin
"Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks.",Michael
"You said, we could bring our families.",Stanley
I did. And why didn't ya Stanley?,Michael
"I did, my wife's name is Terri.",Stanley
"Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terri.",Michael
It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.,Stanley
"[to Dwight, in a low voice] Shut it. [normal voice] Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight.",Michael
Really? We don't have any girls from HR.,Dwight
"No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.",Michael
Yeah?,Dwight
And I was about to take her bra off...,Michael
Yeah!,Dwight
...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-,Michael
Like an AIDS test?,Dwight
No! [under his breath] God.,Michael

"Well, we'll fix it up. You don't have to display that.",Michael
...because that's what happens every time!,Pam
...talking about? He's a jackass every year.,Roy
No.,Pam
"[Put's his hand on Pam's arm] Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's.",Roy
"[Breaks Roy's grip] No, I don't want to go, I don't want to.",Pam

[in a stereotypical oriental accent] Herro everybodeeee. I'm gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould.,Michael

"Oh no, I just, I decided to stay.",Pam

"[doing impression] Oh, dat wir be fwar. Ah, me so horny.",Michael
Right? You know wat I'm talking 'bout.,Michael
[to an off camera waiter and still clutching Jim's beer] Can I get a drink?,Pam
"This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office.",Michael
"Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The 'Hottest in the Office' award goes to... ...Ryan the temp!",Michael
"Yeah. [singing to music] 'Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you.' Here you go.",Michael
What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.,Ryan
"And the 'Tight Ass' award goes to Angela. Not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose. So...come on down.",Michael
No.,Angela
[Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty.,Jim
"No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink! [laughs]",Pam
Second drink?,Jim
The 'Spicy Curry' award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor! Get on up here. Here you go.,Michael
"Spicy Curry', what's that mean?",Kelly
"Um, not everything means something, it's just a joke.",Michael
"Yeah, but why'd you give it to me?",Kelly
"I don't know, it's just...",Michael
This is a bowler-,Kelly
I know. It's ju- they didn't have any more businessmen. So...,Michael
"Yeah, but everyone else-",Kelly
Just sit down Kelly.,Michael
"[sweaty and chugging water from a bottle] It's so freakin' hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do. [Music starts playing in the background] Here we go, he's early with the cue. Here we go.",Michael
[Michael is singing to the tune of 'Tiny Dancer' by Elton John] 'You have won a tiny Dundie.',Michael
Sing it Elton.,Guy at bar
"Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from?",Michael
We just came from yo' mama's house.,Other Guy at Bar
"Oh, alright, yeah.",Michael
Sing 'em a song dude.,Guy At Bar
"Uh, you know what guys, we're just having a little office party, so if you want, uh...",Michael
"[Something flies by Michael] Hey, you know, cool it guys, really-",Michael
You suck man!,Guy At Bar
Let's cut it. [Dwight turns the music off],Michael
"[clears throat] [with a lot less enthusiasm] I had a few more Dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, I'm just going to cut it short. And wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food. Um...thanks for listening, those who listened. [clears throat] This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the 'Don't Go in There After Me' award. It's for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So...",Michael
[give Kevin his award]There you go.,Michael
Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.,Pam
"[starts clapping] Yeah, alright Kev.",Jim
"Woo! Hey, I haven't gotten one yet!",Pam
"Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.",Jim
More Dundies!,Pam
[clapping] Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies!,Pam and Jim
Dundies! Dundies!,Everybody
"[getting his spirit back] Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, we'll keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.",Michael
Fine work! Fine work Stanley!,Pam
You know you did.,Michael
"Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech [other people start joining in]",Pam
"Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don't...",Stanley
"So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. [starts chuckling]",Stanley
And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley...,Michael
...I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.,Michael
It is the 'Whitest Sneakers' award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!,Michael
"Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen! [Pam grabs the microphone from him] Oh, here we go.",Michael
I have so many people to thank for this award.,Pam
"Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them. [people clap] Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because [people start clapping again] this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.",Pam
"Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.",Pam
"And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!",Pam
Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman. [Pam hugs Michael and gives him a quick peck on the cheek] Oh! Thank you.,Michael
What a great year for the Dundies.,Jim
"We got to see Ping. [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding]",Jim
What?,Jim
Nothing.,Pam
Okay.,Jim
What?,Pam
"I don't know, what?",Jim
Oh my God! You are so drunk!,Jim
Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.,Jim
"Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy.",Dwight
He's a volunteer.,Jim
Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-,Dwight
"Dwight come on, come-",Jim
"It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt.",Dwight
"Dwight, get off me!",Pam
"I'm sorry, you're gonna have to put your clothes back on, people are trying to eat.",Employee
[struggling] Ahh! I can't-,Dwight
"Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let's see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost.",Michael
Oh my God!,Pam
Whoa.,Jim
"I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!",Pam
Whoa.,Jim
"Whoa, careful, careful.",Jim
"We have a strict policy here not to over serve. Apparently, this young woman was sneaking drinks off other people's tables. I Xeroxed her driver's license and she is not welcome to this restaurant chain ever again.",Chili's Employee
Great work tonight.,Michael
Watch your step.,Dwight
Excellent.,Michael
"Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion.",Dwight
"Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work.",Michael
I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.,Pam
No you don't.,Jim
"Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.",Jim
"Hey, um, can I ask you a question?",Pam
Shoot.,Jim
"Um, I just wanted to say thanks.",Pam
"Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.",Jim
Alright.,Jim
Bye.,Pam
"Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.",Jim
"TMI. Too much information. I used to say, 'Don't go there,' but that is so lame now. Or, 'You go, girl.' Or... Um, when did 'Where's the beef?' That was, like, a long, long time ago. It's funny how the shelf life of these things, like how long they last, like, 'Too much information' probably came on the scene... I mean, I didn't hear it till, like, this month, so it's pretty recently. Um, but you know, they're generally good for, like, no more than five or six years.",Michael
"Yes, that's true. I have never won a Dundie. I am more than okay with that.",Toby
"I think I'm gonna share some Cadillac Fajitas with Toby. Toby is so cute, except he has that stupid kid.",Kelly
"Yes, I'm the designated driver, which is very important. We need everyone to get home safely. [sighs] But no one ever gives me gas money, and people live all over. It's expensive.",Angela
[scoffs] Like a gaggle of geese... [jibbering mockingly],Dwight
"All right, we need something for Kevin.",Michael
Mmm-hmmm.,Jim
What do we know about him? He's an accountant.,Michael
"He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler.",Jim
[talking over Jim] He's fat. The fat accountant award.,Michael
"Well, you seem to have this under control.",Jim
"The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.",Jim
I am the fat accountant.,Michael
"Michael, I need to talk to you.",Dwight
Here he is.,Michael
I just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies' room wall.,Dwight
"Really? What did they say? 'For a good time, call Michael Scott'?",Michael
Good one.,Jim
"Uh, no, no. No, I think something bad, maybe.",Dwight
"Why do you think that? You just immediately go to that, Dwight? Why are you so negative? Why...",Michael
Michael.,Dwight
"I mean, you just come in and you're just negative...",Michael
Michael.,Dwight
...and you just walk negatively.,Michael
Do you want me to find out what it says?,Michael
Yes.,Michael
By any means necessary?,Dwight
What does that even mean? What are you... What are you talking about?,Michael
It's the ladies' room.,Dwight
"Just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me. But don't tell anybody that I have anything to do with it because if they ask me, I will say that you are crazy.",Michael
"Thank you. You won't regret this, Michael.",Michael
What award would you like to give Dwight?,Jim
I hadn't planned on including him.,Michael
Okay.,Jim
Kevin.,Michael
"It hasn't always been easy being a whistleblower. When I was in school, the kids would call me a tattle-tale or a snitch or a worm. So I really identify with those women from Enron. I wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me, but they never wrote back. I guess they're all married.",Dwight
"Angela, it's simple. Just tell me what the bathroom wall says.",Dwight
I don't talk about what goes on in the restroom.,Angela
I'm not asking what you do in there. I just want to know what's written about Michael.,Dwight
I don't says those kinds of things out loud. It's inappropriate.,Angela
"Okay, I'll talk. You nod if I get it right. Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?",Dwight
I think his characters are pretty funny. Especially Ping.,Kevin
"Well, what should I do, guys? Seriously, do you want me to just cancel the Dundies?",Michael
"No, we were just hoping you wouldn't do those characters, like last time.",Kelly
Ping? Everybody loves Ping. He's my most popular character.,Michael
I think many people find that character slightly racist.,Oscar
"Really? Well, he is based on the Chinese delivery guy that I have, who talks exactly like that, so, I think you should take it up with him instead of me.",Michael
"Look, I'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits.",Oscar
"[sighs] Well, neither of you are Chinese, so what... Why do you care?",Michael
"Dwight, get out of here!",Phyllis
"No, no, no.",Dwight
You can't be in here!,Phyllis
It's not what you think.,Dwight
Shut up. You're a freak!,Phyllis
I'm on official business.,Dwight
You are...,Phyllis
This is Dunder Mifflin...,Dwight
I'm telling Michael.,Phyllis
"No. Phyllis, you're not...",Dwight
I'm telling Michael.,Phyllis
"Phyllis, no. No.",Dwight
"Michael, Michael.",Phyllis
"Phyllis, no, no. Do not listen to her. She's out of her mind.",Dwight
Dwight was in the ladies' room and he was looking at me.,Phyllis
What?,Michael
That is not true.,Dwight
He was looking at me in the ladies' room.,Phyllis
That's totally unfair. I was just in the ladies' room in order to spy.,Dwight
"Dwight, you've hit a new low here.",Michael
That's what I said. He was spying in the ladies' room.,Phyllis
"What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, 'Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.' I'm not even attracted to you.",Dwight
That is a good point.,Michael
Write him up or I'll take it to Jan.,Phyllis
"Okay, all right, I will do that. I will get to that definitely. Absolutely.",Michael
When?,Phyllis
"Oh, I don't know. Maybe after I finish writing, producing, directing, and hosting your awards show. All right, just relax, keep your pants on. Unless, of course, you're in the bathroom and you should be able to take your pants off in that case without Creepsville Central spying on you. Good.",Michael
All right.,Phyllis
"All right, let's wrap it up. Come on, we're late. The Dundies are starting very soon. Accounting, let's go, let's go. Okay, I gave you fair warning. [turns off their computers] Out. Who's next, customer service? Meredith, let's roll.",Dwight
Here we go. [organizing his costumes] And that. [to waitress] Hey. How you doing?,Michael
[singing] You down with the Dundies?,Michael
"Yeah, you know me.",Dwight
[singing] You down with the Dundies?,Michael
The Dundies!,Dwight
[singing] You down with the Dundies? You're all my homies,Michael
You know me.,Dwight
[singing] You down with the Dundies?,Michael
"Yeah, you know me.",Dwight
"[singing] Yeah, all the homies",Michael
I have listened to that song so many times and I still don't know what OPP stands for. Other people's... Something. I... [shakes head],Michael
"So, Pam, I wonder who's gonna get 'longest engagement' this year.",Kevin
"Well. You're not goona get longest engagement, man, 'cause we got that locked up.",Roy
I wonder what I'll get. I brought my fiance.,Kevin
"All right, our next award... ah, yes, this award goes to the most creative writing on the ladies' room wall, and the winner is... Who is it? Who wants to claim it? Shiny Dundie. Who wrote it? Great idea, Dwight.",Michael
I'm just saying I don't think it's appropriate for you to have given Ryan that award.,Toby
"He's hot, all right? What do you want me to do about it?",Michael
"Okay, that is fine to feel, but not to act on.",Toby
"[sighing] It was unanimous, Toby.",Michael
It wasn't a vote. You decided.,Toby
"Well, okay, I based it on what I felt was unanimous office sentiment, and this isn't even about what Ryan thinks. It's about you. It's about how you feel about the Dundies. Admit it.",Michael
"Okay, that is not true.",Toby
"Yes, it is true.",Michael
Cause Ryan asked me to talk to you.,Toby
"Okay, I don't have time for this. I need to get on stage and you are breaking my concentration. [imitating Native chant] Me Chief Michael Scott. Here to trade...",Michael
"Excuse me, Goldschlager, extra flakes.",Dwight
"We don't have that. You want a Presidente Margarita? Blue Pacific Margarita, El Nino...",Waitress
"No, no. No margarita. Hot sake.",Dwight
[shakes head 'no'],Waitress
Fosters in the big can.,Dwight
[shakes head 'no' again],Waitress
"Just a chocolate shake, chocolate sprinkles.",Dwight
"Okay. No, no, no, no, no. Lie still, lie still.",Dwight
I am fine.,Pam
"Dwight, this is crazy.",Jim
Okay.,Pam
"Jim, not now! We need to cushion her head. Lie still. Please, Pam. Do not move.",Dwight
"Dwight, Dwight.",Jim
I'm sorry.,Dwight
[laughing] I am fine.,Pam
"Jim, don't interfere.",Dwight
You have to put your clothes back on. People are trying to eat.,Manager
"Oh, my God.",Pam
"Can you give me a second, sir.",Dwight
No!,Manager
"Dwight, let me up.",Pam
"Put your clothes back on. Get, get right now.",Manager
I am a Sheriff's Deputy.,Dwight
That's fine.,Manager
I could have my men in here in a second and have you arrested.,Dwight
The other volunteers.,Jim
"Pam, are you all right?",Dwight
I'm fine.,Pam
"Sir, sir.",Manager
How many fingers am I holding up?,Dwight
You're holding up three fingers.,Pam
All right. Are you okay?,Dwight
"Put your clothes on, right now.",Manager
I will. I will. You need to calm down.,Dwight
Right now.,Manager
Don't wanna forget that.,Michael
You and your party really need to leave right now.,Manager
Absolutely. Is this mine or is this Chili's?,Michael
You know what? Don't worry about it.,Manager
Keep it. My gift. [hugs Chili's Manager] Thank you. Have a good night. See you next year.,Michael
That's fine.,Manager
"[clears throat] Hey, what's up?",Michael
Hey.,Jim
Any emails today?,Michael
Um... I don't think so.,Jim
No? Um... Check your spam folder.,Michael
Oh! There it is!,Jim

Well done.,Jim

Topical.,Jim
"I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer.",Michael
So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background],Dwight
That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.,Michael
Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?,Dwight
"Um, I...",Michael
Consider it?,Dwight
"Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's... [muffled by jacket over his head] Whup! Come on! Hey!",Michael
What has two thumbs and likes to bone your Mom? [points at self] This guy!,Todd Packer
"Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!",Michael
[makes laser gun noises],Todd Packer
"Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him.",Michael
"bleep, bleep. What's up, Halpert?",Todd Packer
Uh oh.,Michael
Still queer?,Todd Packer
Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!,Michael
"Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So...",Michael
"Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why.",Michael
"Are you kidding? Everyone knows why! You don't know? Okay, check this out. Al lright. So here's the story. So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she is totally incompetent.",Todd Packer
Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy one!,Michael
We're talking blonde incompetent.,Todd Packer
"Oh, yeah.",Michael
Like 10 words a minute... talking.,Todd Packer
"Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there's a lot of dumb people out there.",Michael
"They are women, right?",Todd Packer
Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it!,Michael
"I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch.",Todd Packer
"Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.",Michael
"Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!",Jim
"Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation?",Todd Packer
Oh. Bad boy. [to Ryan] Um... Ryan? [makes Donald Duck noise],Michael
"[to Ryan] Come on, kid. Let's go.",Todd Packer
Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.,Michael
Except pass that breathalyzer.,Jim
You a big William Hung fan?,Ryan
Why does everyone ask me that? Who the hell is that?,Todd Packer
[monkey noises],Kevin's computer
I'm really excited to meet your Mom.,Jim
You are?,Pam
My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.,Pam
I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.,Pam
Oh yeah?,Jim
mmhmm.,Pam
Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.,Jim
Oh really?,Pam
"Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?",Jim
"Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot.",Michael
Yes!,Dwight
Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. 'Old School'.,Michael
Michael?,Toby
"Yes, Toby?",Michael
Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.,Toby
Um... literally two seconds?,Michael
Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.,Michael
The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.,Toby
"No, no, Toby. No.",Michael
"It's really not a big deal, Michael.",Toby
"It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!",Michael
And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer...,Toby
What?,Michael
Just to refresh you... .,Toby
NO!,Michael
on our policy.,Toby
"What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?",Michael
Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.,Toby
There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.,Michael
"Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. [to Toby] So, take it away.",Michael
"Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.",Toby
"I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.",Michael
"A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says 'Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?' This is what's at stake.",Michael
"Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. [to Warehouse guys] Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?",Michael
Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?,Darryl
"Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.",Michael
"Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?",Darryl
Boys R Us!,Roy
Oh!,Warehouse Guy
"Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.",Michael
"Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.",Darryl
"Oooh, okay. That was still about me.",Michael
"Hey, hey, hey.",Roy
What?,Michael
So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.,Roy
I don't feel bad.,Michael
[fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.,Darryl
"No, I don't.",Michael
You look like you feel bad.,Roy
Okay.,Michael
Little package!,Roy
"Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.",Michael
Little package! Little package!,Warehouse guy
Thank you.,Michael
You look good.,Roy

"So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam?",Toby
"Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today.",Pam
MILF!,Kevin
"Thanks, Kevin.",Pam
Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.,Pam
She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.,Pam
Great point.,Toby
Thank you.,Pam
"Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.",Toby
"Hi, is it over?",Michael
"Uh, yes!",Toby
No.,Michael
I can go over it with you.,Toby
"I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.",Michael
It's over.,Toby
"Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?",Michael
Email forwards.,Angela
Exactly! Mmwwah [blows kiss to Angela]! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?,Michael
I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.,Angela
"Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?",Michael
That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.,Stanley
Um... what about office romance?,Meredith
"Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.",Toby
"All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?",Phyllis
"I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.",Michael
"Yeah, Meredith.",Dwight
No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?,Michael
Yes.,Dwight
She would have definitely slept with me.,Michael
She wasn't that hot.,Kevin
"Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!",Michael
"Ok, you know, Michael...",Toby
"I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.",Jim
What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her 'partner' in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line?,Michael
No.,Toby
What if they made out? In front of everybody?,Michael
"Well, that would be...",Toby
At home? And I told everybody everything about it.,Michael
"Okay, I'm lost.",Toby
"Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?",Michael

"I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say?

"No, thanks. I'm good.",Jim
That's what she said. Pam?,Michael
Uh... my mother's coming.,Pam
"That's what she sai [clears throat] Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.",Michael
"Hey, Toby.",Dwight
Hey Dwight.,Toby
You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.,Dwight
Sure.,Toby
"Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?",Dwight
"Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.",Toby
"Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.",Toby
Good. Good. And...,Dwight
I should get back to work.,Toby
Okay.,Dwight
"In today's fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Let's take a look at a couple of scenarios and ask ourselves 'where is the line?'",Man in Video
[Scenario 1: The Natural Redhead],Video
Natural redhead.,Roy
"Hey, Rach.",Actor
"Hey, Joe. Mike.",Redheaded Actress
"Hey, settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead?",Actor
"Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...",Darryl
That's her?,Roy
"Yes, this is the one.",Darryl
No!,Roy
You remember? Yes!,Darryl
At the party?,Roy
You banged her?,Warehouse guy
Yes! [to video screen] Right here. You are a naughty girl!,Darryl
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.",Michael
"[to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.",Jan
"Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.",Michael
"Don't ever let this little bitch drive you around town. We got, uh, lost for half an hour.",Todd Packer
"I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks.",Pam
Where is Michael Snot? Sniffing some dude's thong? Probably.,Todd Packer
"So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.",Michael
I love lawyer jokes.,Mr. O'Malley
"Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.",Michael
"When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.",Michael
"You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?",Jan
The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.,Michael
"Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.",Jan
"Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.",Michael
"Do you need to see the video again, Michael?",Jan
"No, I've seen the video.",Michael
[to Jan] He talked the whole time.,Toby
"No, I didn't. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll]",Michael
"Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.",Michael
Does that include 'That's What She Said'?,Jim
Mmmhmm. Yes.,Michael
"Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...",Jim
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!,Michael
Michael. MICHAEL!,Jan
[laughing] Come on.,Michael
"Michael, please.",Jan
There he is.,Todd Packer
Mwah! [kisses hand and salutes office],Michael
There he is. Good one.,Todd Packer
You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.,Michael
Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really.,Jan
It's... That's...,Michael
That's not my sense of humor.,Jan
"Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.",Michael
Wha...,Jan
I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.,Michael
"[to camera] And motorcycle head injuries, worker's comp, and diet pill lawsuits.",Albiny
This guy does it all.,Michael
"[to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.",Jan
What?,Michael
"Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.",Jan
So I'm not in trouble?,Michael
"I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.",Michael
"Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so...",Michael
"Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here.",Albiny
I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.,Michael
Um... hello.,Pam's Mom
[ecstatic] Oh my god!,Pam
Finally made it!,Pam's Mom
Hello!,Pam
I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.,Pam
This is all yours?,Pam's Mom
Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.,Pam
"Oh, my goodness. That's great.",Pam's Mom
"So a guy goes home, tells his wife, 'Honey. Pack your bags. I just won the lottery.' She goes, 'Oh my god! That's incredible! Where are we going?' He goes, 'I don't know where you're going, just be out of here by five!' [men laugh] Boom!",Todd Packer
This is where I used to keep my computer.,Pam
"Oh, right! I remember...",Pam's Mom
But then I moved it.,Pam
with the picture.,Pam's Mom
"Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...",Pam
Sure.,Pam's Mom
"So this is like, um, an organization station...",Pam
[to Roy] Oooooh!,Pam's Mom
Hey!,Pam
"Well, there he is!",Pam's Mom
How are ya?,Roy
"Hi, handsome!",Pam's Mom
You look great!,Roy
"Oh, thank you! So! We ready for dinner?",Pam's Mom
"Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time.",Pam
"Oh, I don't believe that.",Pam's Mom
"Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?",Roy
"Oh, anything is fine.",Pam's Mom
"All right, I'll see ya.",Roy
So which one is Jim?,Pam's Mom
Mom!,Pam
I just wanted to know.,Pam's Mom
No.,Pam
All right. Okay.,Pam's Mom
Ten minutes.,Pam
Okay.,Pam's Mom
Then we can go to dinner.,Pam
I'll make myself busy.,Pam's Mom
"There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh... [points at Phyllis]",Todd Packer
Phyllis?,Kevin
"No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.",Michael
Ex-squeeze me?,Todd Packer
"Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.",Michael
Packer said it.,Kevin
"No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.",Michael
"I'm the same age as you, Michael.",Phyllis
I don't know about that.,Michael
We're in the same High School class.,Phyllis
"Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.",Michael
You mean where my desk is?,Kevin
"Yes, your corner. Go.",Michael
Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.,Kevin
Mmmhmmm.,Michael
"Oh my. They really got to you, didn't they?",Todd Packer
"They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. [to Phyllis] C'mere, c'mere, c'mon! Come on! Come on.",Michael
Michael! Come on!,Phyllis
Oooh!,Michael
You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...,Phyllis
I'm not worried.,Michael
...report you to HR.,Phyllis
"You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.",Michael
"Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.",Michael
He said what?,Pam
"Good morning, Pam.",Michael
"Good morning, Michael.",Pam
What's going on?,Michael
Nothing. You look nice today.,Pam
What?,Michael
You look real thin.,Pam
I don't get what you mean.,Michael
You just... You look good. Your shirt looks... You look real good.,Pam
"Well, you said I looked thin, so what does... Does that mean I'm like thin weird or thin handsome or... [laughing]",Michael
"Thin handsome, Michael.",Pam
"Yes, well, of course. Of course. [laughing]",Michael
"Wait, Jim, no! Don't drink directly from the can. Okay, I'm serious. It's all over the Internet. They use the same shipping company as a rat poison, and it gets on the can. [Jim takes a drink] Well, you're an idiot.",Dwight
"What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.",Jim
[Email chiming] [snickers] Did you see that?,Kevin
I saw it.,Oscar
You can see her...,Kevin
It's fake.,Angela
How do you know?,Kevin
She wouldn't do that. She's a Senator.,Angela
"Office romance. For example, Pam and I are dating, do we have to disclose that?",Michael
We're not dating.,Pam
"No, but I'm saying hypothetically if we were dating...",Michael
"We're not dating, I'm engaged.",Pam
"Well, Roy is dead, and I ask you out.",Michael
I would say no.,Pam
"You say yes, and we go out.",Michael
I would drown myself.,Pam
"And now Roy and Pam are dead, and we have your stupid rules to blame, Toby.",Michael
"Toby actually gets alimony from his ex-wife because she makes more, so that's kind of embarrassing. Not that I'd mind, but it would never happen to me because I would make the marriage work. People seem to like him because they think he's one of us, but he's not. He's this weird loner who just tells people, 'Don't do this, don't do that. Hire this person for this reason.' I would complain about him, but who would I go to, to complain about Toby? Toby. Bias. And what does he do about that? Nothing. Because he's Toby. What kind of name is that? It's almost a girl's name. I think I've known more girls named Toby than guys. He just kind of makes my skin crawl a little bit. Toby is the devil. Toby's the devil.",Michael
Hey.,Pam
Hey.,Jim
I know we're having that harassment thing this afternoon.,Pam
Yeah.,Jim
"Sometimes when we IM, I send you that little winking face with the lipstick.",Pam
Yeah?,Jim
Yeah. I realize that might be harassment.,Pam
"Yes, it is harassment and I'm going to be suing the winking face. I've hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon.",Jim
Okay.,Pam
Okay. [IM chiming] [laughing],Jim
"I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast.",Michael
"I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.",Ryan
"Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.",Michael
"What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?",Ryan
"Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. 'Home Alone,' 'Risky Business.' Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.",Michael
I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.,Ryan
"Ok. [Removes biscuit, leaving only sausage, egg and cheese.] Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.",Michael
"Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.",Michael
Diversifying. Smart.,Dwight
"Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.",Michael
"And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.",Dwight
Maybe.,Michael
[looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk],Jim
[laughs],Pam
"Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him.",Pam
You see Dwight's coffee mug?,Pam
Mm-hmm.,Jim
"Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it.",Pam
No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh.,Jim
Here.,Pam
Wind.,Jim
Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.,Pam
Perfect. [misses],Jim
Oh.,Pam
Oh.,Jim
You should go.,Dwight
Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.,Michael
Uh huh.,Dwight
Sign the papers at the condo.,Michael
You have your lawyer there?,Dwight
"Uh, I don't need one.",Michael
Can I be your representative?,Dwight
I don't need a representative.,Michael
I think I should be there.,Dwight
"No, No.",Michael
I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.,Dwight
No. Dwight. I'm fine.,Michael
"Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.",Dwight
"Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal.",Michael
So you're taking a personal day?,Dwight
"Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.",Michael
"Please, I'll make you proud.",Dwight
"Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.",Michael
Yes! As your representative?,Dwight
As my associate.,Michael
Same thing.,Dwight
No it is not.,Michael
"I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy.",Dwight
"Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies.",Michael
You headed out?,Pam
We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.,Michael
Ok.,Pam
Very good.,Michael
Have a great time.,Pam
"We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?",Michael
"Yeah, I changed them to your new address.",Pam
Good. The Small Business Man?,Michael
Yup.,Pam
Maxim? American Way? Cracked?,Michael
"Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription.",Pam
"How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?",Michael
[shakes head],Pam
"NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked. Thank you.",Michael
Yeah.,Pam
Ok. See you soon.,Michael
What kind of shocks you got on this baby?,Dwight
"I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?",Michael
[tries to open sun roof] I want to put the top down.,Dwight
"What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside. Don't... please...",Michael
But then no one can see us.,Dwight
I... Just... Would you put it up? [roof opens] Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.,Michael
Check it out. [points at sunglasses] Terminator.,Dwight
I do not understand what you spend your money on.,Michael
[paper football lands on desk] Ooh.,Kevin
"Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?",Jim
"Yeah. It's a terrible system, I know.",Oscar
[points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?,Jim
Eh.,Oscar
"Wait a minute, what is this?",Jim
It's a scoreboard.,Oscar
What?,Jim
Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.,Oscar
Really?,Jim
Yeah.,Oscar
Or when we're bored.,Kevin
"Oh my God! Wait, this goes back two years.",Jim
We're bored a lot.,Kevin
[flicks football onto Kevin's desk] OH!,Jim
Oh!,Kevin
Sweet!,Oscar
Yes! So close. I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game. Yeah.,Jim
We call it Hate Ball.,Kevin
Why?,Jim
Because of how much Angela hates it.,Kevin
"Hey, do you guys have any other games?",Jim
Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?',Kevin
You,Angela
You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.,Oscar
"Home, sweet home.",Michael
Which one's yours?,Dwight
"Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait... [turns around] no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home.",Michael
[bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that's what this sound is all day.,Jim
"Michael, this is Bill. He's the head of the condo association.",Carol
"Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something.",Michael
Nice to meet you.,Bill
Nice to meet you too.,Michael
This is smaller than your old place.,Dwight
"Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.",Michael
"Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.",Dwight
Are we ready to sign some papers?,Carol
"Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.",Dwight
"It's very safe. It's very clean. Also, it's very accepting of all lifestyles.",Bill
It's a very gay-friendly neighborhood.,Carol
Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.,Michael
Let's go check out the master bedroom.,Dwight
"Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?",Jim
"Yeah, I got a game. It's called 'work hard so my kids can go to college.'",Stanley
Fair enough.,Jim
"This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. [points at wall] Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.",Michael
Oh. Terrible idea.,Dwight
I'm putting my bed right over here.,Michael
"No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.",Dwight
"Well, then I will get a warrantee.",Michael
"Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.",Dwight
Well then I won't get a warrantee.,Michael
Shh Shh.,Dwight
"So that's the problem, is solved. What?",Michael
Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.,Dwight
[sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.,Jim
It smells like cookies.,Kevin
"Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.",Jim
"Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.",Pam
I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.,Angela
Let the games begin. [sings Olympic theme],Jim
"And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow.",Carol
What kind of mortgage did you get?,Dwight
Uh... Ten year.,Michael
"Well, ten over thirty, so thirty year total.",Carol
What? Wha? You said ten.,Michael
"Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total.",Carol
"Ho, thirty years.",Dwight
"Ok, ok, ok.",Michael
"Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.",Dwight
Alright.,Michael
"Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.",Dwight
Ok. Alright. Oh boy.,Michael
"Well, this is it.",Dwight
Whenever you're ready.,Carol
"Um. Oh. [moves stove burner] Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?",Michael
Actually yes.,Carol
"Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.",Dwight
Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.,Michael
We'll be here waiting for you.,Dwight
"Oh, man.",Michael
"A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.",Dwight
"Whenever you're ready, Michael.",Carol
"Uh. [breathes deeply, head at knees]",Michael
"You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?",Jim
"Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton.",Pam
Hum.,Jim
"In English, box of paper snowshoe racing.",Pam
"Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.",Jim
"The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.",Pam
"So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?",Jim
I'll do it.,Phyllis
"Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk.",Jim
"The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't...",Michael
What?,Carol
...know if you showed me this same unit or not.,Michael
"Michael, this is the unit you saw and...",Carol
Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.,Michael
Who told you that?,Carol
"As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here.",Michael
"There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down.",Michael
"Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom.",Carol
"No, no, no.",Michael
That's some extra income for you.,Carol
I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.,Michael
"You will lose $7,000 if you walk away right now.",Carol
Ehhhh....,Michael
I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.,Michael
Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs],Dwight
Here we go. Here we go.,Jim
Go! Go! Go!,Pam
Pair of shoes!,Oscar
"Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It's Phyllis!",Jim
It's Phyllis!,Pam
Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.,Jim
Flonkerton.,Pam
"Thank you, delegate from Iceland.",Jim
Wow!,Meredith
[empties bowl of M&M's into his mouth],Kevin
Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.,Jim
"There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.",Michael
You didn't have to...,Dwight
"No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.",Michael
"Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.",Michael
I don't even know what to say.,Dwight
"I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.",Michael
Question. Where can I put my terrarium?,Dwight
What the hell is a terrarium?,Michael
It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.,Dwight
"Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.",Michael
Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.,Dwight
Are you sure you don't want to play?,Pam
I'm sure.,Angela
"Come on Angela, don't you have a game?",Pam
"I have one, yes.",Angela
"Well, let's play, what is it?",Pam
I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.,Angela
We're friends.,Pam
Apparently.,Angela
"Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.",Jim
Are you calling me a ho?,Phyllis
"Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.",Jim
"Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?",Dwight
We take separate cars.,Michael
Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?,Dwight
Why would we do that?,Michael
Just for fun?,Dwight
No.,Michael
Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?,Dwight
"EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok.",Michael
"Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.",Dwight
Ah...,Oscar
OH!,Everyone
Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?,Jim
I did.,Ryan
Ryan Howard. Ryan! [claps] Gold medal.,Jim
I made something for our closing ceremonies.,Pam
What? [looks in box] Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?,Jim
Automatic voicemail.,Pam
"Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work!",Jim
[sees Angela making check mark on tally sheet],Pam
A little bit more and I would have had it.,Stanley
You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm. We paid it off early.,Dwight
"Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.",Michael
People love beets.,Dwight
Nobody likes beets.,Michael
Everybody loves beets.,Dwight
"Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.",Michael
Let's get this roof going.,Dwight
Stop it! [smacks Dwight's arm],Michael
Ow.,Dwight
Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15.,Jim
Oscar!,Stanley
Go! Go! Go!,Crowd
"Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys?",Jim
What is going on?,Dwight
Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er?,Jim
That's my stopwatch.,Dwight
[hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.,Jim
Great.,Oscar
"Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.",Jim
"I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?",Ryan
Hey.,Jim
I have 59 voicemails.,Pam
"Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?",Jim
Sure.,Pam

Really?,Pam
Notify the athletes.,Jim
Cool.,Pam
Michael.,Jim

"Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly.",Michael
Nice.,Jim
You know.,Michael
"Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.",Jim
Really?,Michael
What's this?,Michael
"These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one. [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps]",Jim
"I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment.",Michael
"And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal.",Jim
"Get up here, Dwight.",Michael
Silver medal.,Dwight
"Yep, not as good as gold. [national anthem plays] Why are you playing the national anthem?",Michael
Um... 'Cause your condo's in America.,Jim
Oh. [doves move across cord] What the hell is that?,Michael
Those are the doves.,Jim
Hey. Morning.,Pam
"Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It's important, so...",Jim
Okay. What? What is this?,Pam
I found Dwight's wallet in the parking lot.,Jim
"Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?",Pam
"I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don't know what to do. What do you think?",Jim
I know. I know what to do.,Pam
"Okay, what?",Jim
Okay. Put everything back exactly how you found it.,Pam
Okay.,Jim
"Hey, Dwight. Jim and I found your wallet in the parking lot.",Pam
What did you do to it?,Dwight
Nothing.,Jim
I'm serious. What did you do to it?,Dwight
"Dwight, I swear, we didn't do anything.",Pam
Nice try. [on the phone] Cancel card. Cancel card. Cancel... card.,Dwight
"I mean, you've got, you've got stuff here. You rented 'Mermaids.' You can't... It's a movie. You can't deduct that, you know that.",Oscar
All right.,Kevin
It's not an office expense.,Angela
"Yes, thank you.",Kevin
"Next year, you should file your stuff in a basket.",Angela
"Remember last year he slipped by with 'Stripes.' He rented 'Stripes,' he had it for a week.",Oscar
Please...,Kevin
"And that got through, so maybe he's thinking he can do that from now on.",Oscar
"Please, please. Please.",Kevin
What are the specs?,Dwight
"Oh, okay. I'll tell you. Let's see here. Three bedroom, two bath...",Michael
[talking over Michael] Nice.,Dwight

[talking over Michael] Yes.,Dwight
...wall-to-wall carpets...,Michael
"[talking over Michael] God, what a steal.",Dwight
"...all fixtures included. Yes, this is... This is looking good.",Michael
Does it have a deck?,Dwight
I think it does.,Michael
Have you seen it?,Dwight
Yes.,Michael
Does it have a deck?,Dwight
"I think it has a... Yeah, it has a deck. They call it a porch, but it has a deck.",Michael
"When a man is laying on his deathbed there are four things that go through his mind. Was I well-loved? Check. Did I express myself? Did I let my light shine through? Check. Will an attractive woman cry at my funeral? Check. Probably more than one. Check. Check, check, check, check. Lastly, did I achieve success and own real estate? And when I close on this condo, I will be able to check that one as well.",Michael
What do you call it? Schruteball?,Jim
Okay. How about skeet Schruteing?,Pam
Did you just come up with that?,Jim
Mmm-hmmm.,Pam
That is good. That's it. That's what it is.,Jim
Thank you.,Pam
Wow. [cup tinkles],Jim
"Oh, oh.",Pam
"Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam.",Jim
Oh!,Pam
"Home owner. About to join an exclusive club, Dwight. Maybe some day these people out here will know what that feels like. Maybe not. Who knows? Not my problem. [groans]",Michael
It's time.,Dwight
Are we ready?,Michael
That's it.,Dwight
Are we gonna do it?,Michael
"This is all mine. All the way down around the corner. It's a shared space, but I can use it whenever I want to,",Michael
"Okay, so I called in a favor to my buddy at the police department.",Dwight
"Ah, the volunteer Sheriff station.",Michael
Same thing.,Dwight
No.,Michael
"Um, these are the crime statistics for the surrounding square mile over the past four years.",Dwight
"Oh, anything bad?",Michael
"Two charges of loitering,",Dwight
Mmm-hmm.,Michael
"one noise complaint, several speeding tickets.",Dwight
Mmm-hmm.,Michael
Do you own a gun?,Dwight
No.,Michael
I'd think about it.,Dwight
I don't need a gun.,Michael
Hello?,Man
"Hello! How are you? I'm, uh, just about to close on 126 over there and I guess we're going to be neighbors. Very cool, very cool. So, uh, so what's the vibe? What's the vibe of this place?",Michael
"Uh, I don't know. It's pretty quiet.",Man
Oh... That's gonna change. [laughing],Michael
Why?,Man
Because I loves to party and I'm gonna be partying my butt out at this place.,Michael
"Okay, but there's an 11:00 noise curfew.",Man
"Hi, I am Dwight Schrute, Mr. Scott's associate.",Dwight
Who is Mr. Scott?,Man
"Him. I have got a couple of questions about the neighborhood. Have you had any problems with prostitution, crack dealing, gang violence, etcetera?",Dwight
No.,Man
"Here's a question for you. I have a convertible. Is it safe that park that in my driveway. [Man steps back inside his house and shuts the front door] All right. See you soon. Good guy. Um, cool.",Michael
So it's like volleyball.,Toby
Okay.,Jim
"Okay, you get a one-second hold on the ball...",Toby
Mmm-hmm.,Jim
...and you bounce it off the wall on your side of the tape.,Toby
"Oh, okay. Oh, do... that's what the tape is for. I didn't know.",Jim
"Yeah, Michael asked about it once. I just pretended not to hear him. He left.",Toby
"I think I'm going to make myself some microwave popcorn. [humming] Press 'Popcorn.' Oh, that's gonna be delicious. I just love having popcorn in the middle of the afternoon. You know what? I could do with some hot chocolate as well. Oh, drat. I can't make hot chocolate and popcorn at the same time, unless, I can. Boom! Second microwave for le hot chocolat.",Michael
Hello.,Carol
"Oh, Carol. Hello, how are you?",Michael
"Hello, hi. Hey, Michael.",Carol
Good to see you.,Michael
"Oh, boy. This whole condo's shifting. It's like this place was built on ancient Indian burial ground.",Dwight
"Hey, Phyllis, Do you have any games that you play in the office?",Jim
What do you mean?,Phyllis
"Um, like stapler tennis or something like that.",Jim
No.,Phyllis
Okay.,Jim
"Second bedroom for the ladies. I mean, the extra ladies who aren't in my bed, or for friends or family, whoever wants to pop on by to casa de Scott. And right in here... What, what's in here? Uh-oh, bedroom number three. What are we gonna do in there? Limitless possibilities.",Michael
Seal it off.,Dwight
What? [toilet flushing] What are you doing in there?,Michael
Fill it full of cotton or soundproof insulation.,Dwight
"Oh, my God. Dwight.",Michael
Seal it off with drywall so you don't hear Yo-Yo Ma over there all the time.,Dwight
"You know what I might do, I might make this into a kids' room.",Michael
Kids? You don't even have a girlfriend.,Dwight
I will have a girlfriend once she sees this place. I'm gonna get married and I'm gonna have kids.,Michael
"Well, that depends on how old she is. What if your girlfriend is 55?",Dwight
I'm not gonna date a 55-year-old woman.,Michael
Just a possibility.,Dwight
"No, it's not. Just shut up.",Michael
If you fall in love with her.,Dwight
You're an ass. Shut it.,Michael
I smell mold.,Dwight
"No, you don't.",Michael
"Living on a farm, your sense of smell gets very sharp. For example, there are beets in the condo two doors down that way. And someone over there, I believe, is a big fan of olives.",Dwight
"I'm gonna back out of the deal. Nothing personal, but I feel like I have been taken advantage of here.",Michael
How?,Carol
This smells of fraud to me. This whole thing just kind of stinks.,Michael
[looking into his coffee mug] What the hell?,Dwight
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second.",Pam
Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.,Jim
"Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?",Pam
So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.,Jim
[to Jim] Hey! You can just give her your extension.,Pam
Okay.,Jim
"Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think.",Michael
The temp agency wants to know what you think.,Ryan
"Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! [laughs]",Michael
Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.,Dwight
"Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?",Michael
"Ah, well, I'm interested in business.",Ryan
Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?,Michael
"Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.",Ryan
That is ridiculous.,Michael
Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.,Michael
[speaks in a Yoda voice] Much advice you seek. [regular voice] Do you know who that is?,Michael
Fozzie bear?,Ryan
Mmm... No. That was Yoda.,Michael
There are ten rules of business that you need to learn. Number one: You need to play to win. But... you also have to win to play.,Michael
Got it.,Ryan
And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.,Michael
[to Ryan] [makes clicking noises like shooting a gun] Hey!,Michael
"Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.",Dwight

I'm okay!,Kelly
Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.,Dwight
Let go of me!,Kelly
"Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!",Dwight
"Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands.",Michael
Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.,Michael
Yeah.,Ryan
Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That's rule number two.,Michael
"Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?",Dwight
So what was rule two?,Michael
"Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act.",Ryan
"Okay, well, let's... . let's kind of take it a little slower.",Michael
"Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off.",Dwight
"Okay, uh, well, one is taken.",Michael
"Uh, okay, two?",Ryan
NO!,Dwight
"Okay... uh, sorry?",Ryan
"Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today.",Dwight
"Well, he needs a permanent number, right?",Michael
No.,Ryan
...I don't.,Ryan
"Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers.",Dwight
"Um, yeah. Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges.",Michael
"That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers...",Dwight
"I don't want to be like 'a guy' here. You know? Like, Stanley is the 'crossword puzzle guy'. And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the 'something guy'.",Ryan
"Okay, you know what? I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?",Jim
Ooh.,Stanley
"And, um...",Jim
...Would You Rather?,Pam
Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.,Jim
"[to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a...",Dwight
"Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.",Jim
The Bible.,Angela
That's one book. You've got two others.,Stanley
A Purpose Driven Life.,Angela
Nice. Third book?,Jim
No.,Angela
Okay. Phyllis.,Jim
"Um, The DaVinci Code.",Phyllis
The DaVinci Code!,Angela
Nice.,Jim
I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.,Angela
"Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question: is there fire wood on the island?",Dwight
I guess.,Jim
"Then I would bring an axe, no books.",Dwight
"Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.",Jim
Fine. Physician's Desk Reference.,Dwight
Nice. Smart.,Jim
"...hollowed out, inside: waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question: did my shoes come off in the plane crash?",Dwight
"Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it?",Michael
Yeah.,Ryan
Okay. Thought people read more books.,Jim
DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Yes! Meredith?,Jim
"Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County...",Meredith
Wow.,Jim
Legends of the Fall?,Pam
"Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .",Jim
"Well, I kind of liked Legal...",Pam
"Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.",Jim
I take it back.,Pam
Unforgivable.,Jim
I take it back!,Pam
Good.,Jim
"...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene...",Meredith

"Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?",Michael
[to Dwight] Don't...,Ryan
Good shocks.,Dwight
"Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop! So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. 'M' is for Murder, 'P' is for...",Michael
That's actually a test prep book.,Ryan
...for Phone. What?,Michael
That's a test prep for business school.,Ryan
"Um, oh, thinking about business school?",Michael
"I just got in. I applied, I go at night.",Ryan
Really?,Michael
Yeah.,Ryan
So you think you know a lot about business?,Michael
"No, not yet.",Ryan
Uh huh.,Michael
Just started.,Ryan
Yeah. Quiz me.,Michael
I... wouldn't even know where to start.,Ryan
"Come on, egghead. Let's do it.",Michael
Do it.,Dwight
Quiz me up.,Michael
"All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?",Ryan
Uh...,Michael
"When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me.",Michael
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?,Ryan
Keep an existing...,Dwight
"[to Dwight] Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please? [to Ryan] Uh, it's equal.",Michael
It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.,Ryan
Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.,Michael
"Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.",Dwight
"Okay, Dwight.",Michael
Self taught. You didn't even go to college.,Dwight
"You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about.",Michael
"[scoffs] Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?",Dwight
"For instance, why don't you go to business...",Michael
"[to Ryan] You should learn from him, right?",Dwight
I am.,Ryan
Right?,Dwight
I am.,Ryan
"Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.",Michael
Stupid!,Dwight
"I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so it's not the same thing. At all.",Michael
Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?,Michael
It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.,Ryan
You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me.,Michael
Pam? Get us back into it.,Jim
Okay.,Pam
Five movies. Go ahead.,Jim

"I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?",Michael
Maybe we should get some air.,Ryan
"Nah, I'm okay.",Michael
I'm really uncomfortable.,Ryan

He doesn't even know that I do that.,Dwight
You should tell him.,Pam
"Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.",Dwight
Dwight.,Pam
What?,Jim
"I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.",Dwight
"You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.",Jim
"Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.",Dwight
Yeah. You're right.,Jim

You're all gay.,Roy
"Who's, uh... Who's next? Who we got? Whooo...",Michael
"[answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk... this is great timing.",Ryan
"Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So...",Michael
Would that make you happy?,Dwight
What's that?,Michael
"If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?",Dwight
Yeah.,Michael
I'm on it.,Dwight
Dwight. Hey!,Michael
You can't go in yet!,Angela
"Dwight, don't! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen.",Michael
What if he dies in the fire? And that's the last thing you ever said to him.,Kevin

"Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.",Michael
"[coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.",Dwight
"Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.",Michael
That's exactly what I said.,Dwight
"Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?",Michael

Sure.,Jim
Alright.,Katy
[looking at Roy and Pam] They are soo cute.,Katy
"I'm really sorry, Dwight.",Ryan
"Answer me this, though.",Dwight
What?,Ryan
Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?,Dwight
No.,Ryan
Was it worth it?,Kevin
Really?,Dwight
"I'm really sorry, Dwight.",Ryan
The fire guy! The fire guy!,Dwight
"[sings] Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!",Dwight
"Okay. Rule five - safety first, i.e. don't burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer.",Michael
Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.,Michael
I'll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.,Michael
"Seventy and clear, that's nice. Where's that?",Jim
That's here.,Pam
"I'm Michael's number two. He's one, I'm two. He's Alpha, I'm Beta. He's A, I'm B. It's easy. Whatever Michael is, I'm one less.",Dwight
"Rule three: Reach for the stars. And if you fail, see rule four. Rule four: Failure is not an option.",Michael
"Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these.",Dwight
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And at the end I will reveal, that they were all just one rule.",Michael
That is so cool.,Dwight
Mmm-hmm.,Michael
"Plus you can go, 'Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five.'",Dwight
"No, I'm not trying to trick him. I'm trying to be a good mentor. So...",Michael
Kill or be killed.,Dwight
No.,Michael
"Shoot to kill, or kill to shoot.",Dwight
"No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan.",Michael
You could ask for an extension.,Dwight
I'm not asking the temp for an extension unless I really need it.,Michael
"I know Michael's every move. It's not something you can just pick up. I could write a book about him. Literally. I started once, but Michael made me stop.",Dwight
"Hey, how's it going, man?",Dwight
Good. What's up?,Ryan
"Oh, nothing much. What's up with you?",Dwight
"I'm good, thanks.",Ryan
"Good. Good, I'm good, too. How's it cracking?",Dwight
"Uh, fine. What's up?",Ryan
"You know what you would love? Guns N' Roses. When I was your age, I loved Guns N' Roses. Do you like Guns N' Roses? I'll make you a tape.",Dwight
Cool.,Ryan
I'll make you two tapes.,Dwight
I don't have a tape player. So...,Ryan
"Someday, temp. I've got a couple of shirts that don't fit so well anymore. I'll bring them by. Okay, see you later.",Dwight
"Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don't want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck.",Dwight
"Sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight. [snickering] Sixty-nine. Seventy. Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three.",Kevin
"I like fire drills. You know what's the greatest? Like, when you were in school and the teacher would let you have class outside.",Pam
"Oh, the best.",Jim
"Yeah, it was great because it was like you're supposed to be working, but nothing ever gets done.",Pam
"Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.",Jim
[chuckling],Pam
"Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn't be stuck here at a paper company.",Jim
You're not stuck.,Pam
"Yes, there is a real fire, but it's okay. Everyone got out fine. This is why you practice these things.",Angela
"Yes, yes, I ran out first. A captain is always the first one on the ship and the last one off the ship. And this parking lot is our ship when the building is on fire. So, I ran out onto the ship.",Michael
"Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead.",Jim
"Say Anything, The Shining, Annie Hall, that's too obvious.",Toby
"Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.",Jim
"Toy Story 2, one of the best movies I ever saw. I went for my daughter and stayed because you can't leave your daughter in a theater.",Toby
Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.,Jim
Really?,Pam
Yeah.,Jim
"Kevin, do it.",Jim
"Uh, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, [snickering] Weekend at Bernie's, Weekend at Bernie's II, and, oh, Groundhog Day.",Kevin
Groundhog Day.,Jim
"I have a client who watches that movie once a week, at least.",Stanley
Really?,Kevin
I should put you in touch with him. Maybe we could get together and work on that account.,Stanley
I would love that.,Kevin
"Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?",Jim
"When I was Ryan's age, I worked at Arby's and then I worked selling cutlery for a while. Cutlery that could decimate a penny, I kid you not. There were these shears that could cut straight through a penny. So I have life experience and work experience that Ryan doesn't, and will never have.",Michael
And then you go to school for three years.,Jim
"For two years, and it's only at night, and then it's on your resume forever.",Ryan
"Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?",Jim
$650 bucks,Ryan
A semester?,Jim
A credit.,Ryan
Wow.,Jim
It's an investment.,Ryan
"Oh, yeah, it sounds like it.",Jim
I think it's worth it.,Ryan
"If I could change the life of one person, just one person. I... Actually, that's shooting kind of low. I already did that when I was born. I changed two people's lives. Mom and Dad. Um, if I could change the lives of 5,000 people... 10,000. No, five. I'd be satisfied with 5,000. I... 10,000 though, that'd be something. Wow, 10,000 people. Because, you know what? Even one is amazing.",Michael
"Happy Halloween, everyone! [notices Pam, in her cat costume] Oh... that's great!",Michael
Hey... Happy Halloween. Jan called.,Pam
Ohh... OK.,Michael
"I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month. And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. [dials a number on his speaker phone] Okay.",Michael
[on phone] Jan Levinson's office.,Sherri
"Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.",Michael
"Oh, she's in a meeting. Uh, she just wanted the name of the employee you let go.",Sherri
"Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day.",Michael
I just need the name of who you're planning to let go.,Sherri
I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.,Michael
I know she wanted the name.,Sherri
Okay... Sherri?,Michael
Yeah?,Sherri
"If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?",Michael
"Jan wants the name as soon as possible, Michael.",Sherri
Thanks.,Michael
Mm-Hmm.,Sherri
"I'll call her back. [talks softy, to himself] Wish I could fire Sherri.",Michael
"Hey, I'm still here.",Sherri
Okay! I'm sorry.,Michael
Yeah.,Sherri
No?,Michael
OK.,Sherri
Bye.,Michael
Hanging up now.,Sherri
"I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about.",Michael
[entering] You wanted me?,Pam
Yes.,Michael
[notices Michael's costume] Papier-mache?,Pam
Yes.,Michael
Hmm.,Pam
Yeeesh.,Michael
Mm-hmm.,Pam
"Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.",Michael
Why did you put it off until Halloween?,Pam
Because it's very scary stuff.,Michael
I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.,Pam
You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.,Michael
So it's a man?,Pam
"No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?",Michael
I just answer the phone.,Pam
And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.,Michael
You're costume is fantastic! [laughs],Pam
"I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. [bobs his head around, causing the costume head to jiggle around]",Michael
"Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't. [Michael laughs] Aah! [laughs, then leaves] Okay...",Pam
"Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.",Michael
[eyeing Jim's costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be?,Dwight
"I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.",Jim
That's great!,Phyllis
"Oh, yeah.",Jim
"Yeah, well look... [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me?",Dwight
What are you? A monk?,Phyllis
I am a Sith Lord. [looks at Jim] Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.,Dwight
Ass.,Phyllis
Hey.,Michael
Michael.,Oscar
You guys excited about the party?,Michael
Yeah.,Angela
It's gonna be fun.,Michael
Yeah.,Kevin
Yes.,Angela
"[looks to Oscar] Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.",Michael
What are you implying?,Oscar
All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?,Michael
"You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.",Angela
"Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?",Michael
Yeah.,Angela
"Good. Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.",Michael
But we don't keep two sets of books.,Angela
"Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.",Michael
"Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.",Michael
Why is that?,Kelly
Bend It Like Beckham.',Michael
"Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?",Kelly
[laughs] Yeah. That would be perfect.,Michael
"Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.",Kelly
"Well, I don't really have two heads. So...",Michael
"Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! [punches Jim in the chest and cracks up laughing]",Dwight
"Okay, greatest strength.",Pam
"Okay, okay...",Jim
A dog-like obedience to authority,Pam
Nice.,Jim
But that doesn't sound good.,Pam
"Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]",Jim
"Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.",Jim
He's a gun nut.,Pam
Um. He sticks to his guns.,Jim
"Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...",Angela
Yes?,Oscar
... that has three people...,Angela
Yeah?,Oscar
... doing the work that could be done by two.,Angela
This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh.,Oscar
Yeah. Oh.,Kevin
Who do you think it should be?,Michael
Jim. Definitely.,Dwight
"No, Jim brings in money.",Michael
Phyllis.,Dwight
Eh.,Michael
Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.,Dwight
It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.,Michael
One of the warehouse guys.,Dwight
"[turns to the fake head, listening] What? There was someone left off that list? Who?",Michael
Who is he saying?,Dwight
"You're right, I didn't even think of him.",Michael
"No, Michael.",Dwight
"Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.",Michael
"No, not me.",Dwight
Yeah... I could.,Michael
Not Dwight.,Dwight
I'm not saying that's what he said.,Michael
I know that's what he said.,Dwight
[listening to his head] What?,Michael
"Tell him, not Dwight.",Dwight
That is not a very nice thing to say about him.,Michael
Tell him to stop.,Dwight
Are you kidding?,Michael
"Quiet, you.",Dwight
I agree. He'd land on his feet.,Michael
Make him be quiet.,Dwight
Those aren't chips and dip.,Angela
"No, I made brownies.",Pam
Uh!,Angela
... What?,Pam
I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.,Angela
I made brownies.,Pam
And I made cookies. Same category.,Angela
I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.,Pam
"[on phone] Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. [listens] Uh, yeah. [snaps her fingers in the air, getting Jim's attention] Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.",Pam
"Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.",Jim
"Stanley, could you come with me, please.",Dwight
No.,Stanley
As Assistant Regional Manager...,Dwight
To the.,Stanley
"Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. [Stanley laughs.] I'm serious, Stanley. It's over. I'm sorry.",Dwight
"[laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.",Stanley
So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?,Michael
He wouldn't listen to me,Dwight
"Ahh, come on.",Michael
"If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.",Dwight
"I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... [waves Dwight away]",Michael
"[whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?",Dwight
"Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.",Dwight
Oh... hey.,Oscar
"Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...",Ryan
Oh. [fixes his dress],Oscar
"[on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... [stops and hangs up phone.]",Dwight
"Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real.",Pam
"Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job.",Pam
Um... it's in Maryland.,Jim
"Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge.",Pam
Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away],Jim
Jim...,Pam
"This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael's office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?",Dwight
"Oh, God.",Michael
"I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.",Dwight
Fantastic!,Michael
And I turned it down.,Dwight
What?! That would've solved all my problems.,Michael
Out of loyalty to this company...,Dwight
"Oh, you idiot.",Michael
... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.,Dwight
"If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.",Michael
But then you wouldn't have me here.,Dwight
"Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?",Michael
It's in Maryland.,Dwight
You can call. Can you call 'em?,Michael
I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.,Dwight
Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.,Michael
"Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.",Jim
[clearing his throat and interrupting Jim's talking head] Can I speak to you a minute?,Michael
Um... yes.,Jim
"Michael, I really didn't mean to...",Jim
Help. Me.,Michael
I'm sorry?,Jim
"I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.",Michael
"Oh, you want me to be you?",Jim
Yes.,Michael
Okay.,Jim
"I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.",Michael
"Oh, are you firing Creed?",Jim
"No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head.",Michael
We should switch seats in order to...,Jim
"Yes, that's a good idea.",Michael
"Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...",Jim
Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself!,Michael
Wow.,Jim
"I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault!",Michael
That's an overreaction.,Jim
Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.,Michael
"Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...",Jim
I... this is Creed.,Michael
Okay.,Jim
"I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. [phone rings]",Michael
"Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.",Jim
"And I'm very angry, and I want...",Michael
[picks up the phone] Michael Scott here.,Jim
I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me.,Michael
"Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...",Jim
"Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off.[sits back down in his chair and waves Jim off.] Just, just... yeah.",Michael
What happened?,Pam
It wasn't me.,Jim
Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was...,Pam
"Yeah, I know.",Jim
"Uh, hey... Creed?",Michael
Huh?,Creed
Could I talk to you for a second?,Michael
"You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.",Michael
What are you telling me?,Creed
I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.,Michael
"No, I don't. I wanna stay right here.",Creed
"No, you wanna leave.",Michael
"No, I wanna stay here.",Creed
Why... why are you making this so hard?,Michael
"Um, I think there's a misunderstanding, Michael.",Creed
I think you're right.,Michael
Can I go?,Creed
"No, of course you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye.",Michael
Let's fight it.,Creed
Hmm?,Michael
Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.,Creed
What old days? What are you talking about?,Michael
Did you start the paperwork yet?,Creed
"It's right here on the desk, yeah.",Michael
"You don't have to do this, Michael.",Creed
"I can't, I can't...",Michael
Undo it!,Creed
I can't change anything. This is the way...,Michael
"No, you have the power to undo it.",Creed
"I don't... okay, just listen.",Michael
"Michael, undo it!",Creed
Don't...,Michael
"Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?",Michael
"I have to fire someone today, okay?",Michael
Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.,Creed
"Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.",Michael
"No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You're a fine man.",Creed
Don't...,Michael
"Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good.",Creed
"Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?",Michael
"Creed's an idiot, you know that.",Devon
"Well, he...",Michael
"No, no, no, no, no, no! You had it right the first time.",Devon
"Well, maybe I did.",Michael
"Exactly. You gotta go with your gut, man.",Devon
"Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot.",Michael
That's why I'm being fired?,Devon
No.,Michael
So you might not look like an idiot?,Devon
"No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and...",Michael
This is unbelievable!,Devon
I just hope that you and I can remain friends.,Michael
"Devon, wait, please.",Michael
What!,Devon
"Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.",Michael
"[takes the gift certificate and tears it up] Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp. If any of you wanna meet me for a drink, I'm going to be at Poor Richard's. And the rest of you can go to hell!",Devon
[watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party?,Angela
"Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.",Pam
[motions for her to follow him] Come on.,Jim
"That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.",Jim
"I love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.",Michael
[ringing the doorbell of Michael's Condo] Trick or treat!,Children
"He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.",Michael
I'm a bumble bee.,Kid
You look great! And you're a princess?,Michael
A fairy princess.,Kid
A fairy princess. You're very... .,Michael
I'm a lion.,Kid
"You're a lion. [trying to to open a bag of candy] Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh! [the bag tears open, spilling all the candy] Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.",Michael
"Hey, you. Big Jim. And Phyllis. Working hard, Phyllis?",Michael
Mmm-hmm.,Phyllis
Of course. You're always working hard.,Michael
Thanks.,Phyllis
"Keep it up. And there's Stanley. No costume? Well, no, not trying to fit in. I wish I had your confidence, I really do.",Michael
"Something wrong, Michael?",Stanley
"No, no. What could possibly be wrong? Everything's great. Just keep living your lives. Everything's gonna be fine. [sighing] You are all such wonderful, innocent people.",Michael
"Hey, Jim.",Toby
"What's up, Hef?",Jim
Michael?,Toby
What? What?,Michael
"Michael, do you have the name of the employee you're letting go? I'd like to start working on out-placement.",Toby
"Fine. If you are so anxious to see a head roll, it's you. There. You brought it on yourself. Too bad. Can't say that I'm sorry. It's a relief.",Michael
"I don't report to you, Michael. I report to the head of HR in New York.",Toby
"You asked for a name, I gave you a name. Now you're not doing your job. Why don't you just resign?",Michael
They would just send someone else. You need to have an HR representative.,Toby
"Just know that if I could have fired you, I would have.",Michael
"I know, Michael.",Toby
"I'm going to have to do this Sopranos-style. Just whack him. Guys, could you take the freight elevator, please?",Michael
"Hey, you wanna see a really messy show? Follow us around. Come to our office.",Vance Refrigeration Worker #1
You know what? That's my foot.,Michael
"Ass, ass, ass...",Vance Refrigeration Worker #2
You guys...,Michael
"...ass, ass, ass, ass, ass...",Vance Refrigeration Worker #2
"Hi, Mom!",Vance Refrigeration Worker #1
"I will handle it in the best way possible, but in case he or she goes postal, you will be available to subdue. Am I correct?",Michael
Who is it?,Hank the Security Guard
"I don't know. Hey, are you on our payroll or are you employed by the building?",Michael
Building.,Hank the Security Guard
"Oh, shoot. Okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready.",Michael
You're on your own.,Hank the Security Guard
"All right. All right, this is it. By the time I get back to our floor, I will have decided. [elevator bell dings] Wow, that's a fast elevator.",Michael
"I have a proposal, everybody. Listen up. Now, Corporate has been really breathing down my neck to make some pay cuts, but I refuse to fire anyone. So, I was thinking that maybe all of you would take a 10% pay cut and that would save the money. Yeah?",Michael
"Yeah, We're not doing that. I have kids in college. Make a decision.",Stanley
"Okay, great. Fine. Well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame. Stanley. Not the guy who was trying to be creative. [turns around to find Toby standing behind him]",Michael
"Michael, it's almost 5:00.",Toby
"Leave me alone, okay?",Michael
Do you want some coffee?,Michael
"No, no. I had some, thanks.",Creed
"[slurping] Oh, wow. How long have you worked here? How many years, Creed?",Michael
"Fifteen years, I think.",Creed
"Yeah, that's right. Fifteen years and three months. Wow, you were hired before I was. Must be thinking about retirement.",Michael
"Oh, no. I need the money.",Creed
Why?,Michael
"What do you mean, 'Why?'",Creed
It's just that you never got married and you live in an apartment.,Michael
I don't know. I got nephews.,Creed
Yeah.,Michael
"Yeah. Yeah. And I buy them stuff, you know. Oh, made some bad investments. Why are you asking me this?",Creed
Just trying to be your friend.,Michael
"Well, you never asked me about my life before, is all.",Creed
"Of course, I did. I always... Yes, I do.",Michael
Do you have something specific you wanted to talk to me about?,Creed
Are you pulling my leg or...,Michael
No.,Creed
You have no clue why I've asked you in here?,Michael
I do not.,Creed
"Oh, here we go. This... um, here's the deal.",Michael
"Yes. Actually, I have. I have been on a hunting trip. I shot a deer in the leg. I had to... I had to hit him, I had to hit him with a shovel for about an hour, so he... That's good eating, though. Venison's very gamey. It's hard to watch, though. It's hard to... It's hard to hit another living thing in the face with a shovel for about an hour. That... I haven't been hunting since then. I, I... 'Cause that's, you know, where's the joy in that? Where's the... There's no sport, really. Especially when you're the one with the shovel. And they're the one just lying there. Um... I would have rather hit it with my car or something and just... I was just smacking the hell out of that thing. That was a mess. And we just left him there. I didn't eat it. I didn't want to eat that. That guy. Why do you ask?",Michael
[on the phone] This is Jan.,Jan
His name was Devon.,Michael
Excuse me?,Jan
The human being man's name was Devon.,Michael
"Devon. The... Oh, is this the man that you...",Jan
"[talking over Jan] Yes, yes, yes.",Michael
"The person that you fired, Michael?",Jan
"Yes, it is.",Michael
"Is that what you're... Okay. Oh, you sound a little... A little upset.",Jan
"Uh, well, I am. A little. Justifiably. My Halloween is ruined.",Michael
"Well, I have to say that I am impressed, Michael. I know... I know how hard that was.",Jan
Do you? I don't think you do. Devon was one of my best buddies. And now he hates me.,Michael
"Well, I'm glad you did it, Michael.",Jan
[talking over Jan] You're glad?,Michael
"And so, good job. Good job.",Jan
Thanks. Thanks so much. You think it was good?,Michael
Yeah. Good job.,Jan
[talking over Jan] Think I did a good job? Great. I feel good. I'm gonna give myself a pat on the back.,Michael
[talking over Michael] Yup. Yes.,Jan
There. I'm doing it. Right there. Great.,Michael
You're supposed to be a cat?,Dwight
Yes.,Angela
"You know, guys, Michael has really incredible decision-making abilities. Michael's really incredible at making decisions.",Creed
"[camera pans over, Michael is sitting in a chair] Yeah, blah, blah, blah.",Michael
"Pussy. Here, pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. Meow.",Dwight
"You people are revolting. By far, the least popular people here. I should have fired you. Who knew Devon was so popular and had so many friends. So well-loved.",Michael
"I feel like I made the right choice. Things happen for a reason. I wasn't destined to go to Cumberland Mills. Just like Anakin Skywalker was destined to become Darth Vader, I am destined to sell paper here at Dunder Mifflin. That's what I was put on this earth to do.",Dwight
Where is my desk?,Dwight
That is weird.,Jim
This is not funny. This is totally unprofessional.,Dwight
"Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk.",Jim
I didn't lose my desk.,Dwight
"Okay, calm down. Where was the last place you saw it?",Jim
"Okay, who moved my desk?",Dwight
I think you should retrace your steps.,Jim
"Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!",Dwight
"Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot, hot, very hot.",Jim
"[In bathroom, answers phone] Dwight Schrute.",Dwight
"[On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.",Jim
"Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times.",Dwight
I know.,Jim
It's by the ream?,Dwight
"Uh, yeah, ream.",Jim
"...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%.",Dwight
"Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.",Jim
"Wash your hands, Kevin.",Dwight
"[On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list. Hold on one second...",Jim
"[Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it's Sempai...",Dwight
Umm...,Jim
Dwight...,Dwight
"You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks.",Jim
"Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.",Dwight
Was that your mom?,Jim
"No, that was my Sensei.",Dwight
"Oh, I thought it was your mom.",Jim
"I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.",Dwight
"Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool.",Jim
Assistant Sensei.,Dwight
Ok.,Jim
"I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.",Dwight
I don't want to stay until seven again this year.,Stanley
I don't really have any control over that Stanley.,Pam
"Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm.",Pam
"[singing and tapping on his coffee mug] I don't want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day.",Michael
Did you ask me here for any specific reason?,Ryan
"Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.",Michael
Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael's office],Ryan
"[to Pam] Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.",Michael
"Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.",Pam
"Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.",Michael
It's just last year you...,Pam
"Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam?",Michael
"Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.",Pam
"Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.",Michael
Updating emergency contacts.,Ryan
"Well, is that really a priority?",Pam
"Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. 'Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority.' Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.",Michael
Catch-22.,Ryan
"Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell?",Michael
"Uh, Larissa Halpert.",Jim
What's her address? [Ryan's cell phone rings],Ryan
117 Mount Bergin St.,Jim
Hello?,Ryan
"[in his office on his cell phone, talking in a fake high voice] Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.",Michael
Do you mean Neverland?,Ryan
This is Tito.,Michael
What?,Ryan
Calling from... [Ryan hangs up],Michael
[Reading Jim's palm] You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.,Pam
"You making this up as you go along, aren't you?",Jim
I am just following the website.,Pam
"Well, at least I don't have cavities.",Jim
"Yes, you have very nice teeth.",Pam
Thanks.,Jim
Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan's phone rings],Ryan
Stacy.,Kevin
[looks to see who is calling but doesn't pick up],Ryan
[Taps on the glass in his office to get Ryan's attention] Pick up.,Michael
Hello?,Ryan
[in a high pitched voice] This is Mike Tyson.,Michael
"Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?",Jim
Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.,Dwight
No I'm not.,Jim
"Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.",Dwight
"Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt]",Jim
"Ok, give that back to me.",Dwight
"Ok, say please.",Jim
No. That is not a toy.,Dwight
Please?,Jim
Please?,Dwight
"Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.",Jim
Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.,Dwight
"And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.",Michael
Could you practice on the forms?,Pam
"No women or children, unless provoked.",Dwight
"Ok, Roy?",Jim
Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.,Dwight
Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?,Jim
"Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen.",Michael
Because we're friends.,Dwight
Because I would kick his ass.,Michael
"Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so...",Jim
So? I've beaten up black belts.,Michael
"Uh, how did you know they were black belts?",Jim
"They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out.",Michael
Is your wife still your contact?,Ryan
"Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is 'Becker' now.",Toby
Kay.,Ryan
You don't need to write 'ex'.,Toby
"And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again.",Michael
"Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right?",Jim
You were a Jet?,Michael
Have you signed the expense reports yet?,Angela
"Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. [Puts Dwight in a headlock] Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.",Michael
Argggg!,Dwight
"I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.",Michael
Just hit me. You'll see.,Michael
I can't. I just got a manicure.,Jim
"Oh, queer... [realizes he is on camera] eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.",Michael
Just have Dwight punch you.,Jim
"Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.",Michael
You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?,Jim
What belt are they?,Dwight
"Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'...",Michael
No!,Dwight
... he cried at the end of it. He did.,Michael
"Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.",Dwight
"Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?",Michael
"Ok, I'll punch you.",Dwight
"Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.",Michael
Kiyah!,Dwight
Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!,Michael
"Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not.",Dwight
Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?,Jim
Yeah. [Jim opens office door for Michael] Thank you.,Michael
I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.,Dwight
"Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.",Jim
I don't know.,Pam
"Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips.",Jim
French Onion?,Pam
Obviously.,Jim
Ok.,Pam
Yes.,Jim
"[to Kevin, who he is teaching to fight] Take this pen and stab me with it.",Dwight
[Pam knocks on his door] Go away.,Michael
I just have a quick question.,Pam
"I haven't signed them, ok?",Michael
"No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?",Pam
"Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough.",Michael
He's a purple belt. That's really high.,Pam
"Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him.",Michael
"It's just out there, you...",Pam
"Oh, so that's what they are saying?",Michael
Yeah.,Pam
"Ok, alright, where is Dwight?",Michael
"Uh, Kitchen.",Jim
Ok.,Michael
Hi-yah!,Kelly
Good.,Dwight
"Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight.",Kelly
"Now watch, let me take you from behind.",Dwight
What?,Kelly
"Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.",Michael
"I didn't sucker punch you, Michael.",Dwight
"No, Really?",Michael
"In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.",Dwight
"Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.",Michael
"Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!",Dwight
"Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor.",Michael
"No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.",Dwight
Really?,Michael
Yeah.,Dwight
You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.,Michael
"Ooh, what about, uh, Dwight's dojo?",Jim
"No, they must have class.",Michael
"No, it's free during the day. It's fine.",Dwight
Look...,Michael
I've got the key.,Dwight
Michael...,Toby
"Hey, Toby.",Michael
Any word on those time cards?,Toby
"I've got an idea: why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.",Michael
"Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight...",Jim
I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.,Michael
"Uh, no, it's not.",Ira
I think it is. A guy told me about that.,Michael
"Actually, it's a symbol for eternal discipline.",Ira
Oh.,Michael
"[Reading Pam's palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting.",Jim
What?,Pam
Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.,Jim
"Well, look closer.",Pam
"[Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok.",Jim
Once point for me.,Pam
[Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up.,Jim
"Oh, you're dead.",Pam
"What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.",Jim
"Hey, put me down. Put me down. [Meredith turns and looks at Jim and Pam] Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey...",Pam
"Ok, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach, or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins. Alright?",Ira
"Yes, Sensei!",Dwight
"Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.",Michael
Shi mate!,Ira
Hiii! [kicks Michael],Dwight
Hey!,Michael
"Alright, break.",Ira
What the hell was that?,Michael
Yes!,Dwight
Dwight - awarded a point.,Ira
No.,Michael
Eat it!,Dwight
"Alright, that's the way you want it.",Michael
Two more.,Dwight
"Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man.",Michael
Sweep the leg.,Kevin
"I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.",Michael
No.,Dwight
I got his pants.,Michael
It was my pants.,Dwight
No points for pants.,Ira
"Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot! [Lots of yelling and flailing of arms by Michael and Dwight]",Michael
"Clean single kick, gentlemen.",Ira
"Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.",Michael
"Ok, break. Break.",Ira
No holding.,Dwight
"You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. [Michael is using his head guard to hit Dwight] Eight points. Nine points. [Begins to hock a loogie]",Michael
"No, stop it! Come on! Michael.",Dwight
Open your mouth.,Michael
"No, Michael!",Dwight
"You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? 'Raging Bull.' Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here. [Michael opens his blinds and looks at Ryan in the parking lot] There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This'll be hilarious. [Calls Ryan on the phone, Ryan doesn't pick up after seeing that Michael is calling] Oh, we're playing phone tag.",Michael
"Seven new messages. First New Message. [Michael's voice] 'Hi, Ryan. This is Saddam Hussein.' Next new message. 'Hi, Ryan. This is your girlfriend... and I'm mad!'",Ryan's Voicemail
My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?,Michael
Fudge?,Ryan
"[knock at the door] Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?",Michael
I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.,Dwight
"Ok, to what?",Ryan
Just put 'The Hospital.' Contact number: just put 9-1-1. [Dwight leaves],Dwight
"He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.",Michael
Later Jim.,Kevin
"Later, Kev. [Puts French Onion Potato Chips on Pam's desk] Have a good weekend.",Jim
"Yeah, you too.",Pam
[Knock at the door] Yeah.,Michael
I have the emergency contacts.,Ryan
"Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?",Michael
"Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably.",Ryan
"If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout.",Michael
"Yeah, alright, I'll um, see you Monday.",Ryan
"Alright, bye.",Michael
Dwight?,Michael
"Michael, did you finish yet?",Angela
"This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?",Michael
I'm busy.,Dwight
"Well, [points at himself] busier. Making the time.",Michael
"Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday.",Stanley
We want to go home.,Toby
"Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby.",Michael
The shipping place closes in a half hour.,Pam
"I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.",Michael
This is illegal.,Angela
I don't care.,Stanley
I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?,Michael
Of course.,Dwight
And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.,Michael
"Michael, I don't know...",Dwight
"I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it.",Michael
I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.,Dwight
"No, no, title change only.",Michael
I'll have Pam send out a memo.,Dwight
"No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now.",Michael
Just a formality.,Dwight
Absolutely but not really.,Michael
"Michael, I have so much to learn from you.",Dwight
Yes you do.,Michael
"Thank you, Sensei.",Dwight
"And, ditto.",Michael
"I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.",Michael
[Dwight grunts] Great. Excellent. [Dwight yells] All right. That's okay.,Master
"[Dwight's pager goes off] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, just one second.",Dwight
"Dwight, you can't use your pager in here, I told you.",Master
"Okay, I just...",Dwight
Dwight...,Master
It's a sales call.,Dwight
Ten push-ups. Ten push-ups!,Master
"I can... Yes, sensei.",Dwight
"Do I feel bad that I haven't bonded with the other students? No, I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to attack people.",Dwight
What about Oscar? Could you beat Oscar?,Jim
No problem.,Dwight
I don't know. He looks pretty scrappy.,Jim
"Unless he has a shiv, in which case it wouldn't be a fair fight.",Dwight
True. Meredith.,Jim
No women or children. Unless provoked.,Dwight
Okay. Roy.,Jim
Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.,Dwight
Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael?,Jim
"Yeah, I don't think that would happen. See, I used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types. Real, real bad people. I'm just lucky I got out. I was a bad ass mo-fo. Stanley knows what I'm talking about.",Michael
Excuse me?,Stanley
I've never lost a fight. You know why? My motto. Never say die.,Michael
You just said it. You just said it.,Dwight
"No, that's not how I meant it.",Michael
Die. You just... You said it.,Dwight
"Shut up, Dwight.",Michael
Do you think he's signed them yet?,Angela
Signed what?,Oscar
Forget it. Is that chocolate-vanilla swirl?,Angela
"Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl.",Oscar
Don't look at me. [smiles at camera],Kevin
I don't know why I write my name on things.,Angela
Are you going to happy hour later?,Kelly
I'm still recovering from last night. But maybe.,Meredith
"Sir, your shoes.",Master
Yes.,Michael
You're gonna have to take them off. It's a sign of respect.,Master
"Oh. Well, in my office, if you took off your shoes, it would be a sign of disrespect. Stinkyfeetville. Kind of a ying-yang. [exclaiming] Oh, stretchin'. I like to stay tight. Compact. [Dwight screaming]",Michael
Here's your gear. Please put this on.,Master
"Do you have, do you have anything in, like, black?",Michael
"Okay. Gentlemen. [to Michael] You ready? [to both Michael and Dwight] Okay, listen up.",Master
"Hi, sensei. Hi, Dwight.",Alyssa
[to camera] That's Alyssa. My senpai. She just qualified for regionals.,Master
Alyssa? I guess she's technically the senpai. But nobody really respects her. The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls. Put me in that division. Let's see how she does.,Dwight
"God, you look like such an idiot. [both yelling] [grunting]",Michael
Stan the man.,Michael
"Hi, Michael.",Stanley
"Did you hear about the fight? Well, it wasn't much of a fight, actually.",Michael
No. Are those purchase orders signed?,Stanley
I opened a big can of whoop-ass on him.,Michael
Huh? What?,Stanley
I went medieval on his heinie.,Michael
Are those purchase orders signed?,Stanley
"Hey, Stanley. I don't tell you how to do your job, do I? He...",Michael
"Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don't get these purchase orders...",Stanley
"Grow a pair, Stanley. Right? There not gonna downsize because I miss a lot of deadlines. That's not how business works, okay? [sighs] Okay.",Michael
"For the record, let me just say, Michael Scott has no honor. If he lived in Japan, he would be an outcast. Well, that's not totally true, 'cause Asians worship chest hair. I had a friend, a hairy friend, who lived in Japan. He told me the women would line up to satisfy his every need. So, and he wasn't even that attractive.",Dwight
"[door opening] All right. Here you go, Princess. Just finished with part one.",Michael
This is what you had Ryan do.,Pam
"Yes, under my tutelage.",Michael
"Well, what about the other stuff that has to be in today?",Pam
"If you didn't badger me with so many questions, Pam, I could be done with it by now.",Michael
"[entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet? I've got Michael's lucky tie.",Ryan
No. They're in the conference room.,Jim
Good.,Ryan
"Wait, are those Michael's Levis?",Pam
"Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?",Ryan
"Michael and his jeans. He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens. But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans. I know that's why he started casual Fridays.",Pam
[to Ryan] I'll take those. Thanks. [throws jeans under her desk],Pam
This is a projection of the county's needs...,Jan
"Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework. Looks like USA Today.",Michael
"Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals...",Jan
"So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal. It's Lackawanna County. Our whole county. And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch. And I could work here for years. And years. [groan] Years.",Jim
"So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-",Jan
I changed it. To Chili's.,Michael
Excuse me?,Jan
"Radisson just gives out this vibe, 'Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson'. It's kind of snooty. So.",Michael
"You had no right to do that, Michael.",Jan
Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course. It's where business happens. Small Businessman Magazine.,Michael
It said that.,Jan
It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor.,Michael
Alright. But you will let me run this meeting.,Jan
"Uh huh, uh huh. [under his breath] Power trip.",Michael
What?,Jan
"She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.",Oscar
No...,Jim
"Yeah. And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.",Oscar
That is unbelievable.,Toby
What is going on?,Pam
We are doing worst first dates.,Jim
"Oh my God, I win! Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.",Pam
"Ok, that's a joke.",Oscar
"No, they had to come back for me.",Pam
"Wait, when was this?",Jim
Umm... it was not that long ago.,Pam
"Wait, not Roy. Say it's not your fiance. [laughs]",Kelly
"I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why. Interesting.",Jim
"Ok, let's do this thing. [to Pam] Wish us luck.",Michael
"Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.",Dwight
Thank you.,Jan
"[under his breath] Kiss ass. Ok, probably going to go late tonight. Burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you could all just take off now.",Michael
"Michael, shouldn't take more than an hour.",Jan
Well...,Michael
Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?,Jan
"No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here. [Jan stares at Michael] That's not true. I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare] Hey, everybody, listen up. This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight, until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok? Alright, ciao. [to Oscar] Adios!",Michael
So which way is Chili's?,Jan
"Uh, I'll drive.",Michael
"Oh, no, that's alright. I wanna leave straight from there.",Jan
"It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you?",Michael
I know Scranton.,Jan
At all!,Michael
Alright.,Jan
"You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-",Michael
If it's a couple blocks away-,Jan
Dar de dar.,Michael
Ok.,Jan
"Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan is cold. If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead.",Michael
We should come up with a signal of some sort.,Michael
Why would we need a signal?,Jan
"Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-",Michael
"What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?",Jan
"Well, I... it could be either of us.",Michael
"You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.",Jan
Yeees.,Michael
Hello? Christian?,Michael
Yes.,Christian
Thought that was you. Hi. Michael Scott. This is Jan Levinson-Gould.,Michael
Just Jan Levinson.,Jan
No Gould?,Michael
No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us. Have you been waiting long?,Jan
"No, not long.",Christian
"Uh, Jan, what happened?",Michael
Michael.,Jan
Is Gould dead? What uh-,Michael
"Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry. Excuse me.",Jan
"Wow, you're kidding me! Do you wanna talk about?",Michael
"Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?",Jan
When did this happen?,Michael
We're in a meeting.,Jan
Ok.,Michael
"This way, please.",Hostess
Christian.,Jan
"Alright, after you.",Michael
Thank you.,Christian
[mouths 'Wow' to the camera],Michael
I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.,Jan
"Right. Well, Lackawanna County has not been immune to the slow economic growth over the past five years. So for us, the name of the game is budget reduction-",Christian
Awesome blossom.,Michael
What?,Jan
"[to Christian] I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say? They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?",Michael
Sure.,Christian
"Ok, it's done. Actually, [turns around] Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome? Now it's done.",Michael
So-,Jan
I heard a-,Michael
If you have a-,Jan
Very very funny joke the other day. Wanna hear it?,Michael
"Christian, you don't have to listen to this.",Jan
"It's ok, I like jokes.",Christian
Ok.,Michael
Just the one.,Jan
"Just one joke. Ok. Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke. Umm... let's see... choo choo choo.",Michael
"Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.",Pam
"Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.",Michael
"[to Michael on speakerphone] Ok, you want me to read 'em?",Pam
Yes.,Michael
"Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-",Pam
No.,Michael
When-,Pam
Nope. Told it. Not as good as you think. Pick another one.,Michael
Ok. There's a transcript between a naval ship-,Pam
"Oh ho ho, yea! Bingo! And a lighthouse. Yes. That is hysterical. Could you start that one from the beginning?",Michael
Sure. There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.,Pam
Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael's screenplay on Jim's desk],Jim
It is a screenplay. Starring himself.,Pam
Agent Michael Scarn.,Jim
Of the FBI.,Pam
"How long is this? [flips through pages] Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop. Drawings.",Jim
What is that?,Pam
"Oh, those are drawings. In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head. And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn. Now we know what he looks like.",Jim
"First guy says 'Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn'. And the second guy says, 'Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort'. And the third guy says 'I gotcha both beat, I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe'.",Michael
"Ohhh no! [laughs] Oh my God, that's funny! I almost had Awesome Blossom coming out of my nose!",Christian
"[to waitress] Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?",Jan
"Do we all have our copy of 'Threat Level: Midnight', by Michael Scott?",Jim
"Yeah, yeah.",Everyone
"Alright, let's get this started. I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.",Jim
That's the character's name?,Phyllis
Oh yeah-,Jim
"Ok, you guys should not be doing this.",Dwight
"Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.",Jim
You took something that doesn't belong to you.,Dwight
Dwight-,Jim
Brought it in here-,Dwight
Do you want to play-,Jim
Made copies of it-,Dwight
The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?,Jim
[making the mouth on his tie talk] Yum! Yum yum yum! [Christian laughs] That's delicious! I love it!,Michael
"We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match.",Jan
"Well, we are out to save money.",Christian
What's the bottom line?,Jan
"Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop.",Michael
"That's why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn't have to just shout non-sense words. That's her fault.",Michael
Did somebody say 'baby back ribs'? Hmmm? Hmmmmm?,Michael
I don't think Christian has time for that.,Jan
I have time.,Christian
"[singing] I want my baby back, baby back, baby back [Christian laughs]",Michael
"[singing] I want my baby back, baby back, baby back-",Michael and Christian
[singing] Chili's baby back ribs...,Michael
"[reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. Catherine Zeta Jones enters.",Jim
"Sir, you have some messages.",Phyllis
Not now!,Dwight
They're important.,Phyllis
"Ok, what are they?",Dwight
First message is: 'I love you'. That's from me.,Phyllis
"Not in a thousand years, Catherine. We work together. And get off my desk!",Dwight
"Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of 'Oklahoma' in the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutey the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good.",Dwight
"If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.",Dwight
"Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight.",Ryan
Thank you for noticing. Now keep me company for one more mission. [Pam gets up to talk to Roy],Dwight
"Hey, uh, I have to work late.",Pam
[looks around conference room] You're joking right?,Roy
Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-,Jim
Pow! Pow! Pow!,Dwight
"Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny. Word.",Ryan
Michael's movie? Two thumbs down. [Smiles] Heh.,Kevin
"A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?",Jim
"Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?",Oscar
"Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface. Sam, get my luggage.",Dwight
"I forget it, brutha.",Ryan
"Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever. And you're disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who's Dwigt?",Dwight
"Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And Dwight figured it out. Oops.",Pam
D-W-I-G-H-T.,Dwight
"Ok, you know what? I am done with this. That's it, the end.",Dwight
"Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-",Jim
"Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement. My uncle bought me some fireworks. Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.",Dwight
"That's actually a good idea. We'll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam] Hey, are you hungry?",Jim
Yeah.,Pam
Yeah?,Jim
"So after watching my mom go through so much pain, I decided to keep that promise, that I made to her, and take care of her.",Christian
"Woo, well, this brings us to Jan. Truth or Dare? Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.",Michael
"Oh no, Michael, Michael, please. No, really.",Jan
"Oh, so you're not gonna play? She's not playing.",Michael
It's not fair.,Christian
She's not playing the game.,Michael
We'd been fighting for a while-,Jan
Check please.,Michael
"He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it. But he also knew that I did. I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.",Jan
You didn't.,Christian
I was stupid.,Jan
No.,Michael and Christian
"No, you were not stupid. Gould was stupid. Right?",Michael
That's right.,Christian
You know?,Michael
"You were really brave! You, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists.",Christian
It's true.,Michael
"You said 'World, this is my blood! It's red, just like yours. So love me!'",Christian
"I had plans to meet a friend tonight. Which I had to cancel. But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer.",Jim
[Pam lights a candle] Wow.,Jim
For the bugs.,Pam
"Nice. That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.",Jim
Yes... nice! I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner.,Pam
Right down the street?,Christian
"Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know? I know the challenges this county's up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers. They don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices.",Michael
I know.,Christian
It's bad.,Michael
It's terrible.,Christian
"It, you know what, it really is.",Michael
Uh- [Michael signals for her to shh],Jan
"I don't know. I guess I could give you guys our business, but you have to meet me half way, ok, because they're expecting me to make cuts.",Christian
"Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?",Michael
"So, I guess I'll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours.",Jim
What are you going to do with your time off?,Pam
Travel. I've been looking forward to it. It's gonna be... really nice. Gonna find myself.,Jim
[points to Jim's iPod] You have new music?,Pam
Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely.,Jim
[waving to Christian] See ya.,Michael
Bye... thanks. [pumps fist] Yes!,Jan
We did it!,Michael
We got it!,Jan
Nailed it. Nailed it! Come here.,Michael
I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let's go.,Jan
What!?,Michael
Let's go.,Jan
Goin'. Ok. Where we goin'? Doesn't matter. Goin' to the go go. [nervous laugh] Oh-ok.,Michael
[waking up on office couch] Michael? Michael? [goes into Michael's office] Michael? [looks out Michael's window] His car's not in the parking lot. I should check the accident reports. [taxi pulls into Dunder-Mifflin parking lot] Who's this? Jan?,Dwight
"Morning, Pam. Hey.",Michael
"No, nothing happened. I-I swear, nothing happened. What, I'm, totally being serious. A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I. [laughs] No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all. It's off limits. Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while. It was great. I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm. So.",Michael
"Hello, Dwight.",Michael
Did you do her?,Dwight
Who.,Michael
Jan Levinson-Gould.,Dwight
"Uh, no, no, no Gould.",Michael
Did you do her?,Dwight
This is none of your affair because she is your boss-,Michael
And she is your boss.,Dwight
"And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. [to camera] Jan, I defend your honor. [to Dwight] Is that all?",Michael
Jan didn't come back for her car last night.,Jim
What!?,Pam
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?,Jim
"Oh, I don't know... [Jim laughs, phone rings] Oh my God. This is Jan's cell.",Pam
No way.,Jim
"Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.",Pam
"I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My question: do I do it as the man? Does she do it as my superior? I don't know. That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship. It's, uh, [phone rings] Excuse me. Hello? Hi! Just talking about you. The camera? No. Uh huh. How's traffic? I miss you. What. Ok. Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake. No. [to camera] Would you excuse me? [to Jan] No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm. No, no. [goes under his desk] This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have. Right. No. Wha-so-I don't understand, you wanna see other people. Only other people. Wh-why, ok, I think you're still a little bit drunk [to camera which is now under desk] Excuse me? Excuse me?! [to Jan] I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no. I didn't slip you something!",Michael
Some might even say that we had our first date last night.,Jim
"Oh, really?",Pam
Really.,Jim
Why might some say that?,Pam
"Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.",Jim
Uh hmm.,Pam
"Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. [Pam nods reluctantly] And there was dancing and fireworks. Pretty good date.",Jim
We didn't dance.,Pam
"You're right, we didn't dance. It was more like, swaying. But still romantic.",Jim
Swaying isn't dancing.,Pam
Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.,Jim
I have some faxes to get out.,Pam
"Oh, come on, Pam. I-",Jim
"Ok, we didn't dance. I was totally joking anyway. I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance. Right?",Jim
Have you ever heard of Doctor David Friendly?,Michael
Hmm...,Pam
"Doctor David Friendly's Egg Yolk Diet. It's, it's kind of unique. It's just, my diet the last couple months has consisted mostly of eggs yolks and cottage cheese. And, um, what you do, you don't just have the egg yolks, it's not like a Rocky thing. You do like hard boiled eggs and I got one a those melon ballers [shot of Michael peeling boiled egg] and I, it's just like a little ice cream scoop, and I just scoop out the middle of the egg and just pop it in my mouth. I don't even, I don't even use a plate anymore. Uh, the first couple weeks I did, but you know what, boom, I keep a melon baller in my desk so if I have a hard boiled egg [Jenna breaks as Pam and laughs] I know, I know! But you know what? It's perfect. I know it sounds ridiculous, it sounds ridiculous, but you know what? Dr. David Friendly, he came up with this thing. The guy, I think he was like four hundred pounds when he started, and he started with this... I, well, the melon baller was my idea.",Michael
Most of that is good.,Kevin
"[throwing away food from the fridge] Not today, Kevin. Cannot be around carbs today. You know what one loaf of bread would do to my abs?",Michael
"I'm almost there, so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation.",Jan
Uh huh.,Michael
"And, uh, hmm, excuse me, I've also confirmed the meeting this afternoon at four p.m.",Jan
Conflict!,Michael
What?,Jan
I have a conflict with that.,Michael
What do you mean?,Jan
"Uh, I have a pajama party. At the Playboy Mansion. With the bunnies.",Michael
Michael. I need you to take this seriously.,Jan
I can't get out of it!,Michael
Michael-,Jan
"Ok, alright.",Michael
Are you hearing me?,Jan
"I'm hearing you, meeting confirmed.",Michael
This is a very important-,Jan
"Meeting confirmed. Would you like your confirmation number? Please grab a pen, because I will only be repeating this once.",Michael
[sighs] I'll see you in ten minutes.,Jan
42897. Ok.,Michael
"What is a closer? A closer is a sales term for someone who always gets the job done. And that is me. A B C, always be closing. Glen Garry, Glen Ross. 'Hey, gimme the Glen Ross leads.' 'No way, they're just for closers.' 'Do you know who you're talking to?' 'I'm Michael Scott.' 'Really? Well, take any lead you want.' 'No thanks, I don't need 'em.' Because I have a client list [taps screen] right here in my computer. [sighs] So suck on that.",Michael
Hey.,Jim
Hi.,Pam
What are you doing?,Jim
"I don't know, I think I was just staring at my desk.",Pam
Really? Do you wanna get back to that? I could go. I should go.,Jim
"Yeah, do you mind leaving?",Pam
"No, not at all.",Jim
It's very important.,Pam
Uh hmm.,Jim
Thank you.,Pam
Sure.,Jim
Do you think they'll get the account. [Stanley stares at her] How come you never answer me?,Phyllis
"I'm sorry, Phyllis. No, I don't think they'll get the account.",Stanley
"[reading screenplay] Bullets are flying everywhere. Ooo, wait, last page, big finish. Here we go. Agent Michael Scarn kicks open the plane door with a karate chop.",Jim
A kick and a chop are two totally different things.,Dwight
"Well, it's just a movie, Dwigt.",Jim
It doesn't make any sense.,Dwight
"Yeah, now it doesn't make any sense.",Oscar
Don't jump Agent Scarn! There are no parachutes!,Ryan
"Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head.",Jim
Oh! So close to retirement.,Pam
"Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute.",Jim
Is that it?,Ryan
"Yup, I guess so.",Jim
Does he die?,Phyllis
I sincerely doubt it.,Pam
"I have to say, I think this is a terrible movie.",Angela
"What was my worst first date? Umm. It was a couple of years ago. It was a lunch date, actually, it was right down here, at Cugino's. And we had just met, and we really hit it off, it was, it was kinda nice. Umm, huh. And, uh, then, as it turned out, it wasn't even a date, because she was actually in love with someone else. So, best first date is also my worst first date. Oddly enough.",Jim
[bouncing on an exercise ball] You should get one of these.,Dwight
No. Thank you.,Jim
Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life. Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.,Dwight
Done.,Jim
This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. [knocks things around Jim's desk] Sorry.,Dwight
S'ok.,Jim
"Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex.",Dwight
You're not having sex.,Jim
"Plus, improves your reflexes [knocks over more stuff] see, I would have caught that.",Dwight
"Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?",Jim
It's only twenty-five bucks.,Dwight
"Wow. Um, ok. [pops Dwight's orb with scissors]",Jim
"Pam, could I see you in my office?",Michael
"It's performance review day, company-wide. Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds. So, I don't really know what to expect.",Pam
"Pam, you're trustworthy-",Michael
Thank you.,Pam
And a woman-,Michael
"Oh, no.",Pam
"And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. [Jan on recording] 'Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you. I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews. I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon.' First impressions?",Michael
"Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon.",Pam
"My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been [makes slashing neck hand motion] swack, divorced. Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing. We just sort of got caught up in the moment. The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager. Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason. It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue. Was not professional. Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is. But this was mutual.",Michael
"[playing Jan's message] 'I guess I missed you.' I guess I missed you. So, she misses me?",Michael
She missed you.,Pam
"But then she goes on to say 'that will be our only topic of discussion'. That doesn't mean anything, those are just words.",Michael
I have one idea of what it means.,Pam
"Ok. Yeah, what, what?",Michael
Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.,Pam
"Ohhh, great. Well, now I'm in a terrible mood. Let's do your performance review-",Michael
"Because she's conflicted. She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you.",Pam
"Ah, why, that's great news? That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?",Michael
"Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.",Pam
"Oh, wow, wow. Alright, let's listen to that again. [plays Jan's message] 'Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you'.",Michael
"Oh, hey, listen, Jim. Here's a little tip for your performance review.",Dwight
Ok.,Jim
Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.,Dwight
We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.,Jim
"Oh, yes, we do.",Dwight
"No, we don't.",Jim
"Yeah, it's a new product. So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.",Dwight
"Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.",Jim
"Uh, that is so stupid. What if he gives it to you?",Dwight
I win.,Jim
"Ugh, you know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today. I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday. Uh, stupid.",Dwight
"Wait, wait; one thing. Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?",Jim
"Uh, duh.",Dwight
Duh.,Jim
Today is Thursday. But Dwight thinks that it's Friday. And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.,Jim
Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.,Stanley
Really?,Michael
"Oh, yes. Let's listen to it again. And this time, really listen to the pauses.",Stanley
"God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that? Did you learn that on the streets? Sorry.",Michael
"Oh, no, that's ok. I did learn it on the streets. On the ghetto, in fact.",Stanley
No kidding.,Michael
It's all about my bonus.,Stanley
Michael and Jan definitely made out.,Pam
Ohh...,Jim
Maybe more.,Pam
"Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday. So, keep that goin'.",Jim
"Oh, yea!",Pam
"Good work, Stanley. Great performance review. Stanley in the house, everybody. Woo! Angela, your turn.",Michael
I actually look forward to performance reviews. I did the youth beauty pageant circuit. And I enjoyed that quite a bit. I really enjoy being judged. I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.,Angela
Michael?,Pam
Yeah?,Michael
Jan's on the phone for you.,Pam
"Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.",Michael
Interesting. Jan is calling me. Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all. [puts Jan on speakerphone] Yeah?,Michael
Michael.,Jan
Jan! To what do I owe this pleasure?,Michael
I am returning your many calls.,Jan
"Well, hello to you, too. Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's.",Michael
"No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael. The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.",Jan
"Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's.",Michael
"Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.",Jan
Oh.,Michael
I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.,Jan
Been thinking about you.,Michael
"Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.",Jan
"Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just-",Michael
Michael.,Jan
Yep.,Michael
Are the cameras with you...,Jan
No.,Michael
...in your office?,Jan
"They are not. Yes, they are. [Jan hangs up] That's my girlfriend.",Michael
I heard they made out and had sex.,Kevin
"No, they just made out. That's it.",Oscar
"Well, I heard they made out",Kevin
Don't talk about it. Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.,Angela
Romances?,Kevin
"Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do. I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas. Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down? In a folder? A 'Michael-idea' folder?",Michael
Sorry.,Pam
That's unfortunate. How 'bout the suggestion box? There's tons of ideas in there.,Michael
What suggestion box?,Pam
"The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously? Maybe there's prizes?",Michael
"Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.",Pam
"Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them. Hello, everybody? Yeah, uh, attention, please. Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.",Michael
Don't you mean constructive criticism?,Ryan
What did I say?,Michael
You said 'constructive complements'; that doesn't make any sense.,Kelly
"Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K?",Michael
"[on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...",Jim
Saturday.,Dwight
"[pumps fist] ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.",Jim
"[on phone] We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. [to Pam] Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?",Jan
Sure.,Pam
"Hi, Jan. How are you?",Michael
I'm good; how are you?,Jan
Good to see you.,Michael
Nice to see you.,Jan
"Ok. [tries to kiss Jan's hand] Ok, why don't we just step into my office? We're gonna go in here.",Michael
Can we please go in your office?,Jan
"Yep, right after you. Apres-vous. [mouths to Pam] No calls.",Michael
Oooo.,Kevin
Alright [takes Jan's coat].,Michael
Thank you.,Jan
It's nice to see you.,Michael
"Nice to see you too, Michael.",Jan
Really?,Michael
Not like that.,Jan
"Oh, well.",Michael
"You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top. I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.",Jan
Alright.,Michael
Period.,Jan
Yep.,Michael
Do we understand each other.,Jan
Absolutely.,Michael
"I'm a little confused. 'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy. And then it's like all regret. Because 'Oh, I regret that.' But, 'Wait, I'm still gonna call you.' But, but, 'We're just gonna talk business. And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job.' But what were talking about when we first kissed? Business.",Michael
So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?,Jan
"No, no, no, I finished all of that. I'm very fast. I'm not too fast. Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am. But I do say thank ya ma'am. But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam. Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam. If it's consensual. [cold Jan stare] We're talking about office stuff. Can I ask you a question?",Michael
No.,Jan
"This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise.",Michael
Fine.,Jan
Are you wearing a new perfume today?,Michael
How is that a business question?,Jan
"Well, you're wearing it at the office. And [smells Jan] it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy.",Michael
"Please don't smell me, Michael.",Jan
"Hey, Jim.",Pam
"Hey, how's it goin'?",Jim
"Oh my God, did you see 'The Apprentice' last night?",Pam
"Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?",Jim
Can you believe who Trump fired?,Pam
"No, that was unbelievable.",Jim
Who? Who was it? Who did he fire?,Dwight
You didn't see it?,Pam
"No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night. Crap! I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?",Dwight
"I don't understand- [phone rings] Hold on. Sorry. [answers] Yes, Pam.",Michael
"Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting.",Pam
I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt.,Michael
You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.,Pam
"I did not, not, not use those words.",Michael
"Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting [to Pam] is it happening right now?",Jan
"No, it's in like ten minutes.",Michael
Everyone's waiting in the conference room.,Pam
Great. Very good.,Jan
"Why are we here? Because I value your opinions. Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do. I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing. Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers. Alright. Number one: 'What should we do to prepare for Y2K?'",Michael
What should we do to prepare for Y2K?,Dwight
I thought you read these every week.,Kelly
"Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. [to Jan] That happens occasionally.",Michael
It happens occasionally.,Dwight
"And, um, one down. Next suggestion: 'we need better outreach for employees fighting depression'. Ok, alright, enough with the jokes. Nobody in here is suffering from depression.",Michael
"That sounds serious, Michael.",Jan
"Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?",Michael
Tom?,Dwight
Tom. Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.,Michael
Tom? He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. [blank stares] Tom? [acts like she's shooting herself in the head] Pow.,Phyllis
"Oh, that guy? That guy was weird. Alright, next suggestion.",Michael
Next suggestion.,Dwight
"Arrr, dooby dooby do. 'You need to do something about your B.O.'",Michael
You need to do something about your B.O.,Dwight
"Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion. Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.",Michael
Aren't the suggestions meant for you?,Toby
"Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.",Michael
"Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying. You were inferring.",Creed
"Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. 'You need to do something about your coffee breath'-",Michael
You need-,Dwight
Ok.,Michael
To do something about-,Dwight
"Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.",Michael
Sometimes you talk to us real close.,Angela
"Yeah, is that hard for you? Alright, well-",Michael
"Well, when you have coffee breath-",Angela
I'll work on that-,Michael
It's hard.,Angela
"Let's keep going. Keep it going. Yep. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum. I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.",Michael
"Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?",Dwight
"Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.",Michael
Next suggestion.,Dwight
"Don't sl-', ok, that's blank [Dwight picks up note] Don't, just put it-",Michael
Don't sleep with your boss'? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?,Dwight
"I can't, I can't-",Jan
I don't understand why you're so upset.,Michael
Please sit down.,Jan
Let me ask you-,Michael
You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.,Jan
"Ok, let me ask you this.",Michael
"Please, sit yourself down.",Jan
Let me ask you something.,Michael
"What, Michael.",Jan
Where did you get your outfit?,Michael
[loud metal music playing in a stairwell; Dwight pacing] You are giving me this raise! I deserve this raise! [plays air guitar] Yes! [kicks] Yes! Yes! Hiya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah! Yes! Why are you gonna give me this raise? Why? Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome!,Dwight
I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.,Michael
"Because nothing did, Michael. It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same",Jan
Look-,Michael
Michael?,Dwight
Oh my God...,Michael
"I'm sorry, am I interrupting? Oh God; were you guys making out?",Dwight
"No, Dwight; come in.",Jan
Great.,Dwight
What do you want Dwight?,Michael
I am ready for my performance review.,Dwight
"Ok, great. Your performance has been adequate. You may leave; goodbye.",Michael
"Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?",Jan
"You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.",Michael
"Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?",Dwight
Why on earth would we give you a raise?,Michael
"That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking. Let me bring up one word: dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late. Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia. I even come in on holidays.",Dwight
You do? How do you get in?,Michael
I have a copy of your key.,Dwight
That's a serious offense!,Jan
That is a serious offense. Very serious. As is toying with a man's heart.,Michael
"Oh! Michael, for God sakes!",Jan
I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.,Dwight
"Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?",Michael
"For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.",Dwight
"That was deer!? Gross, oh!",Michael
You liked it!,Dwight
"Oh, did not!",Michael
"Jan, have you ever had deer?",Dwight
No.,Jan
"It's a delicacy. And you know what? It's an aphrodisiac. So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.",Dwight
"What do you say, Jan?",Michael
"Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.",Jan
"Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.",Michael
"[Dwight opens door] Thank you, Dwight.",Jan
"Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you. [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?",Jan
"And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'.",Dwight
That's from Superman?,Michael
"Smallville. And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.",Dwight
Do you think Michael and Jan actually...,Pam
"I don't really wanna picture it. But thank you, Pam.",Jim
How do you come back from that?,Pam
"Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know. Especially working together.",Jim
"No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?",Pam
Oh-,Jim
As a human being.,Pam
"Yeah, no, I don't think you can.",Jim
I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.,Jan
Wait.,Michael
K?,Jan
"Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?",Michael
"Michael, now is not the time or the place.",Jan
"Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?",Michael
"No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.",Jan
"Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?",Michael
"Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.'",Jan
"I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?",Michael
"Michael, it has nothing-",Jan
Am I too short?,Michael
"With your looks, ok? It's your personality. I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.",Jan
Really?,Michael
"Really. You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?",Jan
"I appreciate that, thank you.",Michael
"And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-",Jan
"No, I wasn't, I didn't cry-",Michael
"At this time in my life. I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?",Jan
So my looks have nothing to do with it?,Michael
"Ohhh, God.",Jan
Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now. And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am. And that is all I needed; I'm good. I can go home now.,Michael
"Hey, it's 12:20; where the hell's Dwight?",Michael
Ummm... no idea.,Jim
"Never missed a day, my ass.",Michael
[Jim bows to Pam; she bows back] Thank you.,Pam
[running through parking lot] I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!,Dwight
"Oscar, I'm ready for you.",Michael
"Today is performance-review day, company-wide, and I'm a little concerned about my review. I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn't take it. And I don't have a good answer for him, when he asks me.",Oscar
So...,Michael
"Michael, I don't know what to say.",Oscar
"Um, you're in accounting...",Michael
"Yes, I'm in accounting and I'm sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.",Oscar
"So, good, good, good. Something to work toward, being here more. I'm a big believer in people being here more.",Michael
Yes.,Oscar
You know what this is?,Dwight
Yes.,Jim
"No, you don't.",Dwight
Then why the question?,Jim
"This is a visual aid for my performance review. Budget is tight, and if anyone is getting a raise, it is gonna be a fight to the death. And I intend on winning that fight. 'Dwight: determined, worker, intense, good worker, hard worker, terrific. Dwight.'",Dwight
"I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.",Jim
That's a total waste of your 'M.',Dwight
Really?,Jim
Yeah.,Dwight
You have a better idea?,Jim
"Yeah, magnificent worker, marvelous worker, more money for this worker. Man, I like this worker. Mighty worker. That's good. That's good.",Dwight
I'll use that.,Jim
I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.,Jan
All right.,Michael
Period.,Jan
Yup.,Michael
Do we understand each other?,Jan
Absolutely.,Michael
"I am not going to discuss anything outside of Dunder Mifflin business, period.' Okay. Now, why would Jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period? God, I don't understand women. How about a clear signal, right? Is that too much to ask?",Michael
"So, that's... It's great.",Jim
"Yes, it is.",Michael
Yeah. You have fun?,Jim
"Yes, I did.",Michael
Did you go to first base?,Jim
"Hell, yeah.",Michael
"Oh, yeah?",Jim
Yeah.,Michael
Did you go to second?,Jim
What?,Michael
Second.,Jim
"Kind of, yeah. Over the shirt, my elbow, but...",Michael
"Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?",Jim
"Um, yup, wait, yes.",Michael
Pop-up?,Jim
"No, there... Later there was.",Michael
Really?,Jim
Yes.,Michael
"So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he?",Jim
"I didn't, you know, it was... It was dark, for one thing.",Michael
"Office romances. Um... [laughs] I think you should probably ask Pam 'cause she's in an office romance, technically.",Jim
"Let's just push on, shall we?",Michael
Pushing on.,Dwight
"It's next. Just keep it. 'Look on the supply shelf.' What? What is that? All right, Ryan, look on the supply shelf, would you?",Michael
Yeah. It's another note.,Ryan
"Okay, yeah.",Michael
Look on the windshield.',Ryan
Okay.,Michael
Does it specify which windshield?,Dwight
I'll check them all.,Ryan
This ought to be good.,Dwight
Which one?,Jim
"Oh, no, no. It's on the Miata.",Dwight
He sees it.,Pam
What does it say?,Dwight
He can't hear you?,Jim
"Okay, field trip's over. Come on. Could we please get back to this?",Michael
[clapping] Come on. Let's get back to this.,Dwight
"All right, don't break any lands-speed records getting back, okay, Stanley?",Michael
I'm back.,Stanley
Christ Almighty.,Michael
Look under the sink in the men's room.',Ryan
"All right, next suggestion.",Michael
Next suggestion.,Dwight
"Don't...' Okay, that's blank. Don't. Just...",Michael
Don't sleep with your boss.' Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?,Dwight
"Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself.",Jan
Well...,Michael
"The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that's it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it's just not true, okay? It's not true. So... Is everyone straight on that?",Jan
Crystal.,Michael
There's one more suggestion.,Dwight
How pleasant. You can...,Michael
"Way to go man, Jan's really hot.'",Dwight
"Okay, I think we're good.",Michael
"Oh, my God. When Dwight said no one wants to come in on a Saturday...",Pam
I know.,Jim
I almost lost it. That was too good.,Pam
"Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today's paper on my desk.",Jim
You mean yesterday's paper.,Pam
"What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do.",Jim
Thank you.,Pam
"Hey, temp.",Dwight
Hey.,Ryan
"Look, we're twins.",Dwight
Cool.,Ryan
Bet you I got mine for less than yours.,Dwight
I bet you did.,Ryan
Getting a little something that calm the nerves?,Dwight
What nerves?,Ryan
"For the performance review. Oh, wait, you don't get one. You're a temp.",Dwight
"Actually, I had mine already.",Ryan
You're lying.,Dwight
Why would I lie about a performance review?,Ryan
Why would Michael give you one before me?,Dwight
I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order. [coins dropping],Ryan
How did it go?,Dwight
"Fine. He actually gave me a small raise, which I did not ask for. [hits vending machine] It's stuck. [Dwight begins throwing his entire body into the vending machine] It's cool, it fell.",Ryan
"[Wild Side playing] You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Yes, you are. You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Ya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation, right? You are gonna give me this raise! Why? Because I'm awesome, awesome, yes! Yes! Yes! Thank you for your time, dude. Champ. My lord, mi amigo. Mi amor. Ha! Wild side! I am ready. [groans]",Dwight
"Yeah, that got a little out of control. Jan's taking a break, which is fine. I'm doing the same, just chilling. Getting my mind off of us. She's right. I need to be more professional at the office. When I'm at work, I need to focus on work. I should call her ex-husband.",Michael
"Hello, is this R. Gould? Hi there. My name is Michael Scott, I work at Dunder Mifflin. I believe I work with your wife, ex-wife, Jan. Yeah, that's right, yes. Um... I was wondering if I could ask a personal question about her. Mmm-hmm. Okay, well, could I ask anyway? Uh-huh. Well, I'm just gonna ask. When you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get?",Michael
"Yeah, that Gould is a real interesting guy, a gem. I can see why he and Jan are no longer together. If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was... He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don't know how she dealt with that as long as she did.",Michael
Never...,Michael
"Never for me always means never, ever, ever.",Jan
"Well, then, Gould wasn't kidding.",Michael
What?,Jan
"Nothing, I just...",Michael
"What did you say, Michael?",Jan
Nothing.,Michael
Did you call my ex?,Jan
"No, I did not.",Michael
"Gould, you said, Gould.",Jan
"Maybe I did. Maybe I called him, I don't know.",Michael
"How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you.",Jan
I...,Michael
"Okay, how dare you do that?",Jan
I didn't do that. I... Maybe he called me.,Michael
"Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?",Jan
"Ex-husband, you have to let it go.",Michael
I mean...,Jan
"Look under the suggestion box.' 'I can't believe I kept this up all day.' Signed, me.",Ryan
"What is an office? Is it a group of people? Maybe. Is it an idea? Of course, yes. Is it a living organism? Exactly, yes. And any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that's me. But the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is Jan. But the brain needs a heart, and that is me again. So ironic. You know what? The heart is smarter than the brain. But the brain is so effing hot.",Michael
"It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania. [sees man in a turban outside] Oh my God. Ohhh. [dials phone number] Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. Oh, we have a serious problem here. [goes out onto office floor] Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights. Pretend you're not here.",Michael
Are we in danger?,Jim
"There's no time to think about if this is real. Just, shh, everybody. [knock at the front door]",Michael
"Michael, should I call the... [Michael waves his hands] What?",Kevin
The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.,Michael
"Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected...",Michael
That just means you have to enter your password.,Sadiq (IT guy)
Oh...,Michael
"What's your password, Michael?",Sadiq (IT guy)
"Oh, umm... [looks at Post-It on computer]",Michael
"Oh, it's 1-2-3.",Sadiq (IT guy)
Yes.,Michael
Mi-,Dwight
AH! Guh-oood.,Michael
Sorry.,Dwight
Please don't do that.,Michael
"Ok, I'm sorry. What is going on in there? Why is he here? What are you doing?",Dwight
I can't tell you.,Michael
You have to tell me.,Dwight
I don't have to tell you anything.,Michael
"Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.",Dwight
"Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this. [flexes his arms] Brrr! That's strong!",Michael
"Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-",Dwight
I'm not going get a brain-,Michael
Or get hit by a car-,Dwight
Stop it.,Michael
"Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.",Dwight
"Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok? Why don't you just go... away?",Michael
"There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees. His salary, that would depress them. His bed, it--- And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails.",Michael
So how do you search?,Michael
By keyword phrase.,Sadiq (IT guy)
"Try 'profits'. No! Try 'Michael Scott'. 'Michael' 'boss' and 'funny'. [Sadiq (IT guy) types; result pops up] Oh my God, wow! [chuckles] E-mail from Stanley. Stanley, Terribly nice guy. [reads e-mail] 'Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late.' Well, Stanley's an ass. Not one of our harder workers.",Michael
"Hey, what's the deal, Michael? Why are you spying on our computers?",Oscar
"Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy! What other ghost stories do you have for us? That I'm a robot? [robot voice] I will destroy everything in my path-",Michael
"Actually, it's just-",Oscar
Beep! Bop!,Michael
Ok...,Oscar
Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk. [Tin Man voice] Oil can. Oil can.,Michael
Tin Man. Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.,Oscar
"Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.",Michael
So it's true? You have access to our e-mails?,Dwight
You know what the problem is?,Michael
I think I do.,Stanley
"The problem is that when people hear the term 'big brother', they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother.",Michael
I gotta erase a lotta stuff. A lot of stuff.,Kevin
"Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.",Dwight
I know.,Angela
Good. [Pam overhears],Dwight
[whispers to Jim] Hey. Something just happened. Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.,Pam
What?,Jim
I know!,Pam
Hmm...,Jim
Do you think that they're like-,Pam
No.,Jim
"No, right, no, no.",Pam
[humming],Jim
"Uhhh, ew, ew, ew... .Maybe?",Pam
It's like squishing a spider under a book. It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead. Sooo... [to camera guys] If you guys see anything... ?,Pam
"Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.",Pam
Nice.,Dwight
"One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental. Who do you think he should choose?",Pam
Does he have access to their medical records?,Dwight
Ummmm...,Pam
"I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections. There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.",Dwight
"Meredith has an E-vite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim's tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my e-vitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be... .[scrolls down list] No.",Michael
"Hey, Angela-",Pam
Hi.,Angela
How's it going?,Pam
It's ok.,Angela
"Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight?",Pam
No. Are we supposed to?,Angela
"No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so.",Pam
Hmm... [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me.,Angela
Oh.,Pam
"There's always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler.",Michael
That's pretty young.,Kevin
Yeah.,Pam
[to Michael] Are you gonna eat with us?,Kevin
"Of course. Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of. Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles. This is a meal in a cup.",Michael
Uh hum.,Jim
"Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college. Lived on this stuff. Brain food. Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college? The parties. Everybody'd go. The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.",Michael
The professors would go to the parties?,Pam
Yeah! They were the most fun. We always invited them.,Michael
"It's true. I'm having a party. I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael. So three ingredients for a great party. And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody. Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up. [sighs] He is very real.",Jim
[to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh... Yes! Thank you!,Pam
Question: on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-,Dwight
"Oh, uh, no. Could-",Jim
I was wondering-,Dwight
"Could, keep that down.",Jim
Why?,Dwight
Because not everybody knows about the party.,Jim
Like who? Who doesn't know?,Dwight
"Umm, Michael.",Jim
Why just Michael?,Dwight
Because it's a surprise.,Jim
Is it?,Dwight
Uh hmm.,Jim
"Oh, that's perfect!",Dwight
"So, don't tell.",Jim
I won't.,Dwight
Ok.,Jim
"So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.",Jim
Really? That's great.,Pam
I know.,Jim
Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.,Pam
"[laughs] Oh man. Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff. So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...",Jim
"Oh, no, he can't make it.",Pam
"Oh, ok, cool.",Jim

Really?,Jim
"Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.",Pam
"Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together, you know? Like people can just be friends. And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.",Pam

Surprise! [laughs] Everybody!,Dwight
Dwight...,Phyllis

Talk! Just talk!,Michael
I am-,Mary-Beth
Shut up!,Michael
"Funny story: the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv. The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says 'Hey you're funny, you're the funniest guy I've ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt.' [giggles] And that was an improv. Um, the real way is that I found a flyer.",Michael
[Oscar shakes his leg] You're going to have to stop that. [Oscar moves over] I can still feel it.,Angela
Do you have a question or something?,Sadiq (IT guy)
Um...,Michael
"About my turban, maybe?",Sadiq (IT guy)
"Nope, nope. I actually wear a turban sometimes. Wanna see it?",Michael
Yeah.,Sadiq (IT guy)
Got it right here. [pulls out Karnak turban],Michael
Why do you have that?,Sadiq (IT guy)

"In Pittsburgh? Yeah, but I never really watched him.",Sadiq (IT guy)
Oh. You were forbidden.,Michael
"No, I'm much younger than you. I watched Conan.",Sadiq (IT guy)
"Alright, I'm gonna, uhh, get a cup of coffee. Do you want some coffee er-",Michael

Or some tea or hummus or something?,Michael
"No, thank you.",Sadiq (IT guy)
"Oh, this isn't good.",Phyllis
It's fine.,Stanley
You don't even know what I'm talking about.,Phyllis
"Should have done this a long time ago. Tons of personal e-mails, huge time wasters. Uh, uh huh. Wow, like Kevin, rating the best bars in Scranton? Poor Richard's number seven? Idiot. Stupid load. [phone rings] Yeah.",Michael
"Hey, Michael, accounting needs your approval on-",Pam
"Yeah, I'm busy right now. [hangs up]",Michael
"Here's a helpful suggestion for Jim. Jim, instead of e-mailing Amazon, to try and get that CD that you didn't receive, I suggest that you go to Visa and tell them to cancel the charge.",Michael
"Yeah, definitely didn't need help with that, but, yeah.",Jim
It's seems like ya did though-,Michael
Oh?,Jim
"Jim. Lots of e-mails to Amazon, lots of wasted computer space. Alright, let's get back to work.",Michael
"Yeah, I assumed Michael was already doing this. That's why I only use my personal e-mail account.",Toby
"[moves chair to Jim and Dwight's desks] Ooo, bleh bleh bleh.",Michael
Where's your tie?,Dwight
"I don't know. Just felt like taking it off. Man, work can be just so damn frustrating don't ya think, Jim?",Michael
"Uh, yeah, I guess.",Jim
"What's going on, Michael. Talk to me.",Dwight
"I don't know, same old stuff. Same old. Boss just been ridin' my ass.",Michael
Oh no! Jan!? What's goin' on?,Dwight
"I don't wanna talk about it. I just wanna hang out, just be one of the guys.",Michael
The most important one of the guys.,Dwight
That's not the point.,Michael
"That's exactly the point. You've hit a slump. It happens to the best of us. You just have to remember, you know-",Dwight
Yeah.,Michael
"Where you come from, and who you are.",Dwight
Ok.,Michael
"You know, you have worked so hard for this. You are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.",Dwight
"Ok yes, I would never do that.",Michael
"Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger.",Jim
Ha.,Michael
"Jim, this is hardly the time.",Dwight
"No, this is completely the time, this is perfect time. This is just guys gently ribbing each other, it's what it's all about, just hangin' out. Enjoying friends, all being the same. Worker bees.",Michael
And their king bee.,Dwight
"No, just bees, just bees hanging out, buzzing around.",Michael
Master bee.,Dwight
I'm not a master bee.,Michael
Queen bee.,Dwight
"I'm just a bee, Dwight, ok, just a bee, just buzzin'.",Michael
Hi!,Pam
"Hey babe. Hey, how are you!?",Roy
Good.,Pam
You look good.,Roy
Thank you.,Pam
"Hey, um, I was wondering if it'd be ok if I go to Lonny's poker game tonight. I promise, it'll be like the last time for a while.",Roy
We were supposed to go to the barbeque at Jim's house.,Pam
"Oh, man. Um, could you go without me? Make something up, say I like, ate something, or...",Roy
Uhh...,Pam
"Huh, huh? You're the best. You're the best!",Roy
I might be late.,Pam
"Ok, don't wake me up cause I'm playing ball in the morning.",Roy
Ok.,Pam
"Alright, bye. [Pam looks around the office]",Roy
[to the cameraman] Did I miss anything?,Pam
"Five o'clock. Time to go get my improv on. [drinks] Little bit of the comedy juice. Mmm. Alright, see if you can guess what this is. [roars and flails his arms] That is a dinosaur getting ready to go to improv class. Just a taste of the improv.",Michael
I need to know... who shot Johnson!,Michael
"Uh, President Johnson. Um-",Mary-Beth
Shut up!,Michael
Ok.,Mary-Beth
I have a right mind to shoot you right in the head.,Michael
"I, I killed him. You're right! It was me!",Mary-Beth
Just shut up! I don't wanna hear anything more from you.,Michael
"No, listen to what she's saying.",Improv Teacher
"Alright, I'll be quiet if we can make some kind of deal. A deal?",Mary-Beth
"Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! No deal. Not with Michael Scarn, FBI. Michael Scarn doesn't make deals. Michael Scarn shoots and then asks questions later. [blows on his fake gun]",Michael
"Good, good.",Improv Teacher
"She was kind of tripping me up, cause she was, um, I was trying to get something going, when I was over her with the gun, and she like kept changing the story.",Michael
I don't think... he was saying-,Mary-Beth
"Well, you kept-",Michael
He kept saying 'shut up'-,Mary-Beth
Going into nuclear something; that's not where the scene was going.,Michael
I-,Mary-Beth
It goes wherever.,Bill
"Well, it goes, it goes in the best direction, and that was not the best direction.",Michael
"I felt like he was ordering me around, cause he-",Mary-Beth
"Well, he, Michael Scarn, that character, orders people around, and that's, you should of just gone-",Michael
"All your characters order people around though, and-",Improv Teacher
Well...,Michael
There's stronger choices.,Improv Teacher
I don't think there's any stronger choice than being a really strong character.,Michael
"We've seen you do that character before though. I mean, you know, that's cool.",Mary-Beth
"Well, it's, like, well, it's, you know, when refine it, refine a character down to its essence, that's...",Michael
Like Jim Carrey or something.,Mary-Beth
"Exactly, thank you.",Michael
"Right, well I wasn't saying that-",Mary-Beth
I appreciate that.,Michael
"Nah, I know, I just meant that... he shot me, I just-",Mary-Beth
"Or Ryan Stiles, something like that.",Michael
"Yeah, ya know maybe, he made me get on the ground, and I didn't feel safe in this game.",Mary-Beth
"You shouldn't have been, 'cause you were dealing with Michael Scarn. That was exactly what I was hoping to achieve, so that is probably the best thing you could have said, that's a compliment.",Michael
You succeeded.,Improv Teacher
Good work.,Michael
Yeah.,Mary-Beth
"And in this room here, if you look closely, you will find out a few clues about who lives here. Um, he likes biking, obviously, and uh, what else? Uh, he likes tour guides, I guess. And if you're very perceptive, you'll notice that he didn't do a great job of cleaning his room [kicks water bottle under bed]. Ok, and uh, that's the tou-",Jim
And he's really into penguins or something?,Ryan
"Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don't know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are.",Jim
"Oh, I'm sorry. I gave you a penguin.",Phyllis
"And that's why it's on my desk, Phyllis; it means a lot to me, and now that I know it was from you, it means even more. Moving on! Uh, ok, so that's the end of the tour for now, and if you liked it please tell your friends: 'Whenever you're in Scranton, visit Casa de la Halpert'.",Jim
"Ok, for the next exercise, let's everyone pair up.[everyone picks a partner] And everyone got somebody? Ok, good. [Michael is partner-less] Uh, ok, uh, why don't you go out in the hallway and go through all the rules in your head. Ok, you take a break and sort of run through the rules in your head. Ok, stay there.",Improv Teacher
I'll just throw out some suggestions.,Michael
"Ok, you guys wanna start? [to Michael] Don't throw out any-",Improv Teacher
They're in a whorehouse.,Michael
Suggestions.,Improv Teacher
And he's a proctologist. [to teacher] What?,Michael
"We don't need a suggestion for this one; it's gonna come from them. [to other students] It's a game called 'Yes, and?' and uh, you will say the first sentence. And uh, you're telling a story-",Improv Teacher
First sentence is: 'I'm a proctologist'.,Michael
"We're not gonna get a suggestion for this one, it's gonna come from them. [to students] Ok, you're gonna say the first sentence and then she will say yes to that and then she'll add something to the story, like you're telling a story. [looks at Michael and then students] Oh yeah, what was he doing? Ok, why don't you take a break? Since you don't have a partner.",Improv Teacher
"Alright, I'm ready here.",Michael
Ok.,Improv Teacher
"Why don't you turn it up? [Ryan moves to turn up the grill] Uh! Not so fast... Fire Guy. Think we need some more heat, Fire Guy? Hey, Fire Guy, maybe we should burn Jim's house down.",Kevin
That's really funny.,Ryan
"Hey, Kelly; I called him Fire Guy.",Kevin
"Good one, Kev.",Kelly
Yeah... hey Stanley-,Kevin
He called me Fire Guy.,Ryan
"Oh, good one. [laughs]",Stanley
It never gets old.,Kevin
Never gets old.,Ryan
Go. Get the door.,Dwight
Here we are.,Michael
Go. Push!,Dwight
Oh god.,Michael
Push!,Dwight
"No, no, turn it around.",Michael
Really shove it.,Dwight
You'll break it.,Michael
Shove it through! Break it!,Dwight
"You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight.",Michael
All right.,Michael
I got a splinter.,Dwight
"Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have! [laughs] Nice, huh?",Michael
I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.,Dwight
"On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three.",Michael
"One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.]",Dwight
Merry Christmas!,Michael
Did it work?,Michael
"[holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?",Kevin
"A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.",Michael
But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?,Kevin
"Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about.",Michael
"So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.",Jim
"Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?",Angela
"Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?",Phyllis
We'll see.,Angela
Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.,Ryan
"[comes into the conference room in a Santa hat and beard] Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, [points to Ryan] pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?",Michael
Fifty.,Angela
Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.,Michael
"It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.",Michael
"I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.",Michael
You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.,Pam
"Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.",Michael
"One, two, three. [they lift and start to move a desk]",Kevin & Oscar
You guys should use a hand truck.,Dwight
Do we have one?,Kevin
No.,Dwight
[having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me?,Angela
No! No way! It... no.,Michael
"Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.",Darryl
You wanna be Santa?,Michael
Yeah.,Darryl
Have you ever seen Santa?,Michael
"Yeah, I've seen Santa.",Darryl
Okay.,Michael
Who cares?,Darryl
"Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work.",Michael
"Michael, I would like to be the elf.",Dwight
That makes sense because he has elfish features.,Michael
"[now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.",Dwight
I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.,Toby
"I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.",Oscar
"I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't [smiles happily].",Kevin
You get something good this year?,Michael
I think I did a pretty good job.,Jim
Yeah? Who did you have?,Michael
"Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.",Jim
I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.,Michael
Yeah?,Jim
I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.,Michael
"Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?",Jim
Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.,Michael
"That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..",Jim
It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.,Michael
"Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.",Dwight
I know how to plug something in.,Stanley
I want to do it.,Dwight
"All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?",Michael
"Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree]",All
Not great.,Michael
"I'm sorry, everybody.",Phyllis
I think the tree looks nice.,Pam
"Hey, I could get some flares from my car.",Dwight
"No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa.",Michael
"Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, 'Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth.'",Michael
"First present, Oscar.",Dwight
[rips off the wrapping] Shower radio. Neat.,Oscar
"Oh, good, that was from me.",Kelly
"Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..",Oscar
Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.,Dwight
"Oh, cool. [opens his plastic bag]",Jim
That's from me.,Creed
Great. Where did you get it?,Jim
I don't know. It was so long ago.,Creed
"He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.",Jim
Yep. That's exactly what happened.,Creed
Pam.,Dwight
"[opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.",Pam
There's a little more to it.,Jim
"All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present]",Dwight
"No, don't!",Michael
"[unwraps present] Whoa, a video iPod.",Ryan
"Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.",Michael
Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.,Ryan
You don't know that.,Michael
"Yeah, you left the price tag on.",Ryan
I did?,Michael
Yeah.,Ryan
"What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?",Michael
Michael.,Dwight
"Oh hey, for me. What is in here? [opens a handmade oven mitt] Oh, come on.",Michael
I knitted it for you.,Phyllis
An oven mitt? Okay. [walks out],Michael
"So Phyllis is basically saying, 'Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth.' I gave Ryan an iPod.",Michael
Should we just keep opening up the presents?,Kevin
We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.,Dwight
I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.,Michael
What is Yankee Swap?,Jim
"One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.",Michael
I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.,Jim
"Yeah, we call it White Elephant.",Pam
"Well, I call it fun!",Michael
Why are we doing this?,Oscar
Because it's better. Because it's more special.,Michael
It sounds mean.,Angela
"Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.",Michael
Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry],Angela
"Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt.",Michael
I'll take the teapot.,Meredith
"Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.",Jim
"Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.",Michael
I'll take the iPod.,Pam
And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?,Ryan
"Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.",Dwight
[after Ryan opens a new gift - a nameplate saying 'Kelly'] That was meant for Kelly.,Stanley
"Yeah, I figured.",Ryan
I think this is going great.,Michael
[unwrapping the poster] Yikes.,Kelly
"Well, it's for Angela, so ..",Toby
"That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen.",Kelly
"Angela, you're up.",Dwight
I'll take the poster. Some people like these.,Angela
I will steal the iPod.,Kelly
Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.,Michael
"Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.",Michael
I'll take the ... teapot.,Oscar
Damn it.,Meredith
"Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go.",Dwight
I really want the iPod.,Meredith
It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.,Dwight
"[holding oven mitt] I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful.",Michael
I'll take the oven mitt.,Meredith
"Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.",Michael
"Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.",Michael
"[opens present] 'In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute.'",Michael
"You and me, Michael. Yes!",Dwight
Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?,Michael
I never said it was better than an iPod.,Dwight
"Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.",Dwight
"[shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!",Dwight
Last gift. Kevin.,Michael
I want the foot bath.,Kevin
"That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.",Kevin
"Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.",Dwight
I want the iPod.,Pam
Damn it.,Kelly
Sure you don't want the teapot?,Jim
"Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But ..",Pam
Right.,Jim
"Sorry, I ..",Pam
No. No. Definitely. It's ..,Jim
"Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.",Kelly
Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.,Dwight
Got to be kidding me.,Jim
Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.,Dwight
[after Phyllis leaves suddenly] What is she so upset about?,Michael
Maybe because you hated her present so much.,Pam
Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.,Michael
"Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.",Jim
And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.,Stanley
"Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!",Michael
You got a bonus check?,Oscar
How much?,Pam
"It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000.",Michael
"All right, I'm done now.",Stanley
"Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame.",Michael
It comes to $166.41.,Liquor Store Clerk
"All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?",Michael
"Fifteen bottles of vodka? Yeah, that should do it.",Liquor Store Clerk
"Cool, cool. Box it up.",Michael
"I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?",Jim
No trades.,Dwight
"Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.",Jim
A real man makes his own luck.' Billy Zane.,Dwight
"Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?",Jim
No. I want it. I'm going to use it.,Dwight
You don't even drink tea.,Jim
"True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..",Dwight
Okay ..,JIm
".. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]",Dwight
"To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.",Jim
This is awesome.,Roy
I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.,Pam
"Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money.",Roy
So what are you going to get me instead?,Pam
"I don't know. Probably like, a sweater or something.",Roy
Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.,Michael
What is that?,Angela
"This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.",Michael
We can drink?,Meredith
We're really not supposed to serve alcohol.,Toby
"Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?",Michael
Me. Please.,Meredith
"Go, here we go!",Michael
"The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to drink anymore. During the week.",Meredith
Hi guys.,Phyllis
Hey.,Ryan
"Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance?",Phyllis
Kevin Malone.,Kevin
"Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.",Bob Vance
Stanley Hudson.,Stanley
"Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.",Bob Vance
Ryan Howard.,Ryan
"Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.",Bob Vance
"What line of work you in, Bob?",Ryan
"I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man.",Roy
"Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done.",Darryl
"It's possible. I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man.",Roy
I had to. I needed defense.,Darryl
Come on! Shaun Alexander? He's the best back in the league.,Roy
It's defense.,Darryl
"Oh, no. That is not worth it.",Roy
It is worth it.,Darryl
Never.,Roy
Are you kidding? You wait.,Darryl
"Anybody making out in here? [checks hallway] Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. [takes picture of Jim] Okay, how's it going in here? [takes picture of Meredith and Kevin]",Michael
We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?,Ryan
There should be some ..,Angela
"No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party.",Michael
"One, two, three. [do a shot]","Phyllis, Meredith, Michael, Kevin"
"Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.",Michael
"Oh, no.",Ryan
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",Michael
I really did not do anything.,Ryan
"Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.",Michael
"You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.",Jim
"[laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot]",Pam
But ..,Jim
"I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..",Pam
"Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.",Jim
[opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture!,Pam
"Yeah, I think I made the right choice.",Pam
"Oh, my God! It's incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer?",Pam
I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.,Jim
This is so awesome.,Dwight
"Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to.",Michael
Thank you.,Dwight
You're welcome.,Michael
"[grabbing Michael around the neck] Merry Christmas, asswipe!",Todd Packer
"No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!",Michael
[rapping] What's up my nerds. Check it out. [points at the mistletoe stuck down his pants],Todd Packer
"Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.",Michael
Pacman need a drinky.,Todd Packer
"Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up.",Michael
[listening to music through headphones] Yeahhh.,Kevin
Darryl. There you go. [hands him the Santa hat] You earned it.,Michael
"That's okay, Mike.",Darryl
"No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.",Michael
"All right. Thanks, man.",Darryl
"Hey, Merry Christmas.",Michael
[looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that?,Ryan
Mine.,Kevin
"Oh, how did I not guess that?",Ryan
[coming out of his office] Lampshade on head! It's happening!,Michael
"[as Jim decorates a passed out Todd Packer] Oh, no.",Creed
Hey.,Kelly
"Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing?",Dwight
I don't know.,Kelly
You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.,Dwight
"Thanks for the party, Michael.",Kevin
Yeah.,Meredith
"Oh, hey. Listen up. We're going to Poor Richard's. Who's in?",Bob Vance
I'm in.,Oscar
Yes.,Dwight
Michael? Poor Richard's?,Oscar
"Yeah, that sounds good.",Michael
"Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time.",Michael
"Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's?",Michael
Yep.,Meredith
"Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? [Meredith drops her top. Michael takes a picture] All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?",Michael
Yeah.,Meredith
Okay!,Michael
Towards me.,Oscar
Okay.,Creed
"Towards me. That's good, towards me. Towards me. Towards me, towards me. Okay, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.",Oscar
"Okay, okay. [gasping]",Creed
Creed.,Oscar
"Remember on that animated special when they taught the uh, the monster to put the star on top? That's Dwight. Dwight's the monster that we taught to put the star on top of the tree. You take his teeth out, and he could put the star on top of the tree.",Michael
Do you want me to help you with that?,Pam
Yeah.,Phyllis
Phyllis and Angela and Meredith are helpers. I guess Angela's kind of... Angela's little. Phyllis and Meredith are not little. Pam is sort of a medium helper.,Michael
Okay. Christmas lights? Good. Tinsel? Good. Star? Good.,Dwight
"Dwight is... Dwight looks like Spock to me. He always wears the ears, and I always give him grief about looking like Spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be Spock, for some reason.",Michael
"Question, Pam. Is Roy coming to the party?",Dwight
Yes.,Pam
"Okay, well, you didn't tell me that. Now, he will not be allowed in unless we register him on this list.",Dwight
Are you kidding?,Pam
"Do I look like I'm kidding? [Pam shakes her head 'no'] Phyllis, stag, I assume.",Dwight
I'm bringing someone.,Phyllis
Really?,Dwight
I invited someone to the party. Bob Vance. He works at Vance Refrigeration next door. That's how we met. [whispers] He's my boyfriend.,Phyllis
"Everyone, please remain calm until we receive further instructions.",Dwight
"Just let us open up the presents, Dwight.",Pam
Absolutely... not.,Dwight
"What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly. When bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate. I prefer the human way.",Dwight
"Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too.",Oscar
"Well, thank God you didn't steal my oven mitt. And Oscar, you little gourmand, your turn.",Michael
I'll take the tea pot.,Oscar
Damn it.,Meredith
"So, I guess, you really didn't want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea.",Kelly
"No, I just like tea.",Oscar
"I don't know why Oscar didn't like the gift. I know he wanted a shower radio. I mean, I totally remember him telling me that he wanted one.",Kelly
"Kelly had me last year, too, and she gave me the same exact thing. I only have one shower.",Oscar
"Oscar, paint ball pellets.",Michael
I guess I'll take the last gift. Cool.,Oscar
"It was supposed to be for Meredith, 'cause she said she likes my drawings.",Pam
Thanks. I wish I could've had it. Do you wanna trade?,Meredith
Yeah. Like anybody would want an oven mitt. [Phyllis gets up and leaves the party],Michael
"So, hey, you wanna trade?",Toby
"Yes, totally, 'cause I was just gonna throw this out anyway.",Kelly
Really? You were gonna throw out a book?,Toby
Mmm-hmm.,Kelly
"[Rap music playing] [singing] The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer My name's DMC with the mike in my hand And I'm chilling and cooling just like a snow man",Kevin
Yeah.,Darryl
[singing] So open eyes Lend us an ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year [Darryl whooping] Yeah.,Kevin
I'm the DJ because I really know how to heat up a party.,Kevin
"I do enjoy a drink now and again, but tonight, no. I am also an officer of the law and I'm unofficially on the clock. I need to stay sober and alert. Also, on a personal note, I'm not at my best when I drink.",Dwight
I actually got that for you. I had you originally.,Ryan
"Oh, cool. It looks really interesting. What did you end up with? [Ryan pulls Creed's old coat out of a bag] Sorry.",Toby
"I didn't want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy.",Ryan
Christmas.,Toby
"Yeah, Christmas.",Ryan
What did you end up with?,Oscar
Your shower radio.,Creed
You like music at least?,Oscar
I love it. I actually used to have a radio show back in the '70s.,Creed
You're kidding. What was your DJ name?,Oscar
Whacky-weed Creed.,Creed
Turns out that Creed is a pretty interesting guy.,Oscar
You behaved very badly tonight.,Angela
Sorry?,Kelly
"See, that's what Christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, 'Man, I wish I got that.' I mean, that's just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else. I don't know, it's just... I don't know, just makes you kind of feel good.",Michael
Hey.,Jim
Hello. Jim?,Dwight
"What's up, buddy?",Jim
This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?,Dwight
"Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.",Jim
"Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.",Dwight
"Who, Steve?",Jim
"Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.",Dwight
"Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.",Pam
"No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.",Dwight
"Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.",Pam
"Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.",Dwight
I love these.,Pam
"Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?",Dwight
"Oh, there it is. J1.",Jim
But I don't have any...,Dwight
"Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.",Jim
"[putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...",Dwight
"Hello, everyone.",Michael
"Good morning, Michael.",Dwight
Where are we going this afternoon?,Phyllis
Ah! Ha ha ha!,Michael
"Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.",Pam
"It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.'",Jim
A ski mask and a swimsuit.,Pam
"So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.",Jim
And brush our teeth.,Pam
Yeah?,Michael
Michael.,Stanley
Stanley! Bo banley.,Michael
I need to know...,Stanley
Banana fana fo fanley.,Michael
What we're doing.,Stanley
Be my mo manley.,Michael
You said bring a toothbrush.,Stanley
Stanley.,Michael
Is this an overnight?,Stanley
"Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?",Michael
Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?,Stanley
"Maybe, I don't know.",Michael
Not maybe. Yes or no.,Stanley
"Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.",Michael
In January?,Stanley
It's cheaper.,Michael
This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.,Michael
It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!,Michael
All right!,Meredith
I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?,Ryan
"No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.",Michael
I'm already in business school.,Ryan
"Well, this...",Michael
"Wait, Michael?",Kelly
Yeah?,Michael
Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?,Kelly
To throw you off the scent.,Michael
"Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.",Kelly
"Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.",Michael
I took the tags off already.,Kelly
"Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, 'Who is this smart little cookie?' Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.",Michael
"I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.",Michael
"Leader... ship. The word 'ship' is hidden inside the word 'leadership,' as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!",Michael
"Last year, Michael's theme was 'Bowl over the Competition!' So guess where we went.",Oscar
"Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?",Michael
How about the sales department is the sails?,Darryl
"Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.",Michael
A furnace?,Phyllis
"Yeesh, how old is this ship?",Jim
How about the anchor?,Pam
What does the furnace do?,Phyllis
"All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!",Michael
I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?,Jim
Titanic?,Michael
I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.,Pam
"No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!",Michael
"Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.",Jim
"Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned.",Phyllis
"No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.",Michael
What?,Darryl
"The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.",Michael
"Aye aye, Captain.",Dwight
"[singing] A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.",Michael
"Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. [to Kelly] Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... [to Stanley] We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.",Michael
Cool.,Dwight
"Actually, I'm the Skipper. But you can be Gilligan.",Captain Jack
"I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.",Michael
"I am Captain Jack, I am captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on the ship. [to boarding passengers] Hi, welcome aboard.",Captain Jack
Okay.,Michael
"In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose.",Michael
"Hey, look! I'm king of the world!",Michael
"Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack.",Captain Jack
"And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!",Michael
Okay! So...,Captain Jack
Okay! So...,Michael
Please. The life preservers.,Captain Jack
Right.,Michael
"They are located underneath the seats, all along the border of the boat.",Captain Jack
"But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.",Michael
"Well, we might, okay? Please let me finish, okay? Thank you. So, the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. On this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side. [Dwight laughs loudly.] Not only am I your ship captain, I am also your party captain! Whoo! We're gonna get it going in just a few minutes here...",Captain Jack
I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...,Michael
"Okay, Michael, if you don't mind...",Captain Jack
Rock it!,Michael
"Please, okay?",Captain Jack
"If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'!",Michael
Michael.,Captain Jack
Yep.,Michael
"Your company's employees are not the only people on the boat tonight, okay?",Captain Jack
We're all gonna have a good time tonight!,Michael
Why don't you let me and my crew do our job. You just sit back and have a good time. All right?,Captain Jack
Hm? Okay. Yep.,Michael
"You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right?",Katy
Yeah.,Roy
"Pam, were you a cheerleader?",Katy
"No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!",Roy
That's hilarious.,Katy
"It's not hilarious, but...",Jim
Where did you go to school?,Roy
Bishop O'Hara.,Katy
"Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you?",Roy
"Um, no.",Jim
"Yes, I did! [chanting] A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!",Katy
I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!,Roy
Having fun?,Michael
Yeah. Everybody's really nice.,Brenda
"Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.",Michael
When are you going to start the presentation?,Brenda
"Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.",Michael
"Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo!",Captain Jack
"So, okay.",Michael
"Limbo, whoo!",Dwight
All right! I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick. Who's it gonna be?,Captain Jack
Me.,Meredith
Okay...,Captain Jack
"Me! Me, me, me.",Dwight
Uh... usually it's a woman.,Captain Jack
I'm stronger.,Dwight
"Hey, I got an idea! How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight?",Captain Jack
Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you!,Captain Jack
"I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.",Dwight
"All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest!",Captain Jack
"But before that, I have to do my presentation.",Michael
Nope! Dance contest!,Captain Jack
"All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!",Michael
Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.,Michael
[singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?,Dwight
"Hey, come inside and talk to me.",Angela
"I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!",Dwight
[chanting] Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot!,Darryl and Katy
"Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!",Roy
"No, I'm not going to do that.",Pam
Come on!,Roy
That's what I'm talking about!,Darryl
"Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?",Pam
I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!,Roy
It's getting kind of rowdy down there.,Pam
Yeah. [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!,Jim
Sometimes I just don't get Roy.,Pam
Well...,Jim
"I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?",Pam
"Oh, um... [A long silence.]",Jim
I'm cold.,Pam
"So, what's this presentation all about?",Captain Jack
"Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?",Michael
Women and children.,Captain Jack
"No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.",Michael
That's a stupid analogy.,Captain Jack
"Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.",Michael
"Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm.",Captain Jack
Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.,Dwight
Okay.,Michael
"Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.",Dwight
I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?,Katy
"Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice.",Pam
"Suppose your office building's on fire. Jim, who would you save?",Captain Jack
"Um... let's see, uh... The customer. Because the customer is king.",Jim
"Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.",Michael
He's just sucking up!,Captain Jack
"When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?",Roy
"Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her.",Captain Jack
You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.,Jim
"Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!",Roy
"I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?",Michael
"No, it was Captain Jack.",Roy
"Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing. Congratulations. That is great!",Michael
"We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship!",Captain Jack
Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!,Michael
"No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.",Pam
Then I'll give you away!,Michael
"No, thank you.",Pam
Do you think that'll ever be us?,Katy
No.,Jim
What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?,Katy
I don't know. Let's break up.,Jim
Whoa. What?,Katy
This is where Captain Jack drives the boat.,Captain Jack
Wow!,Meredith
Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.,Dwight
Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.,Michael
Really? What?,Brenda
"Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...",Michael
Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on here?,Captain Jack
"It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.",Michael
"I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.",Michael
Is somebody there?,Michael
What happened to you?,Jim
Captain Jack has a problem with authority.,Michael
"Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?",Jim
"He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.",Michael
What a night.,Jim
"Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.",Michael
She was always engaged.,Jim
Roy said the first one didn't count.,Michael
"That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...",Jim
"Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...",Michael
"Yeah, I know.",Jim
"Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.",Michael
"Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.",Jim
"Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.",Michael
She's engaged.,Jim
BFD. Engaged ain't married.,Michael
Huh.,Jim
"Never, ever, ever give up.",Michael
"Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.",Dwight
"It's a fake wheel, dummy.",Michael
Are you all packed?,Phyllis
"Yes, I brought my duffel bag and a sleeping bag.",Kelly
Where do you guys think we're going?,Oscar
Definitely some place you can swim.,Kelly
Right.,Oscar
Maybe Florida.,Phyllis
Did you hear something?,Kelly
[knocking] Yeah.,Michael
"Hello, Michael.",Jan
Hello.,Michael
Can we come in?,Jan
"Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.",Michael
Thank you very much.,Jan
Have a seat.,Michael
Brenda.,Jan
"Oh, every man's dream.",Michael
"Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss?",Jan
"Two ladies at once. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Okay, you heard something. Um, yeah, it's a booze cruise, but it... There's more to the story than that. It...",Michael
A booze cruise? What do you mean?,Jan
"Leadership off-site. Uh, booze cruise is just a rhyme...",Michael
"Michael, we discussed the IRS's regulations.",Jan
"Yeah, I don't even know why I said booze cruise. I don't even think there's booze on the boat.",Michael
"Okay, this event has to have legitimate business content to be tax deductible.",Jan
Of course.,Michael
We discussed that.,Jan
"Of course, of course. Yes. Yes. Look, I have a whole program planned. Jan, this program is going to change people's lives. I am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat.",Michael
Good. This is Brenda Matlow from corporate training.,Jan
Hello.,Michael
"I thought she could attend tonight, and if your event is appropriate, you could give it to other branches.",Jan
"Oh, cool. Cool. And maybe you could attend tonight and then you could stay over at my house for the night. Awkward. That's... You know what. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?",Michael
Jan said if you asked me that I was supposed to say no.,Brenda
"Really? You seriously said that? Okay. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?",Michael
Sure...,Brenda
Brenda.,Jan
Thanks.,Michael
"I mean, no.",Brenda
"Okay, you know, I'm gonna go now, and...",Jan
"Oh, okay.",Michael
"Good luck, Brenda.",Jan
I'll see you later.,Michael
"Okay, see you later. And try to be professional.",Jan
I'll call you later.,Michael
"No, that's all right.",Jan
That's like...,Michael
"You call me if you need anything, Brenda.",Jan
"I'll call you, too. [to Brenda] So. You are probably gonna get carded, so I can make you a fake ID. We have a laminating machine.",Michael
"What is a sales department? Oscar, what do you think?",Michael
I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat.,Oscar
I'm not giving you the answer. Deck hands is one. And...,Michael
"Oh, oh, can I be the first mate?",Dwight
"No, I'm first mate. You're second mate. I'm first mate, as the captain.",Michael
How about the anchor?,Pam
"Well, the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down. Toby is the anchor. Oh, God. He, well... [to Brenda] Tell you about Toby later, he's awful.",Michael
"Yeah, I know Toby from Jan's birthday.",Brenda
"Hey, Brenda.",Toby
"Oh, hey, Toby. So... It's an analogy.",Michael
[Toby running to get on the cruise] Hey! What's wrong with you? You missed the boat.,Michael
I got lost.,Toby
Idiot.,Michael
We can go back.,Captain Jack
"No, no, no. That's his punishment for not being here on time. Too bad, anchor!",Michael
I guess I shouldn't have stopped for dinner.,Toby
"On the high seas, Captain Jack is the leader. On the land it's Michael. On the ramp up to the boat, I was a bit conflicted. But now that I'm here, I'll follow Captain Jack to hell and back.",Dwight
"Hey, Captain Jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake?",Dwight
"Perch, bass.",Captain Jack
"You know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats Catholics. Have you heard...",Dwight
"I haven't heard that, Dwight.",Captain Jack
"If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy, and you can count on me.",Dwight
"That's good to know, Dwight. Thanks.",Captain Jack
"Your problem now, Captain Jack.",Michael
Hey. You know what the best way of studying is?,Michael
"At home, not on a boat?",Ryan
Flash cards.,Michael
Flash cards. Doesn't really help me right now because I'm on a boat.,Ryan
You are gonna get seasick if you keep reading in here.,Michael
Well...,Ryan
"Yeah! All right. All right. That was awesome. All right, looks like the guitar player's gonna take a little break. So this'd be a great time to head on over to the taco bar. All right.",Captain Jack
"That is a great way to kill this party. Not on my watch. Let's, uh,... Let's rock. Let's rock some stuff here, okay? [playing badly] Okay... I'm hearing a little too much reverb. [feedback echoing] Can we down the reverb? All right. Follow my lead. [playing Smoke on the Water] Does you guys know that? Take the bass. Take the drums. What?",Michael
Do you want me to give it a shot? Just...,Creed
You know what? I don't think it's in...,Michael
I...,Creed
That's not in tune. I don't know if you can...,Michael
"I don't know, let's try.",Creed
"...make much of out of it, Creed. Good luck to you. I don't know. It is a defective ax, my friend.",Michael
All right.,Creed
Good luck.,Michael
"Guys, E, blues. Follow me, okay? [playing well]",Creed
Yeah!,Roy
"Back in the '60s, I was with the Grass Roots. We toured with Janis Joplin, The Doors, Cream. We had a lot of fun, And now I do quality assurance for a paper company. As you can imagine, drugs played a part. They still do. My work calls last about 90 seconds, and that's about as long as I can concentrate.",Creed
Those slide moves are just bush league. I hope I die before I'm old.,Michael
[throwing up],Ryan
"[speaking Spanish] Por favor, tequila seoor.",Darryl
I think you've had enough.,Angela
"What you say, bitch? You know, you might be right.",Darryl
You've been to the lake before?,Pam
"Yes, I have. [kisses Pam]",Roy
Should have done it a long time ago.,Roy
"Yes, you should have.",Pam
"I do what's right whenever I figure it out. I love you, babe.",Roy
Love you.,Pam
You should make a toast.,Katy
"No, I really don't want to.",Jim
"Jim, come on, don't be shy.",Katy
"Everybody, everybody? There is a toast. Come on...",Katy
Yeah! Toast!,Michael
"Yeah, toast! Toast! Toast!",Katy
Yeah.,Pam
Come on.,Roy
"Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...",Jim
"Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution?",Dwight
"That's my line! That's my line, That's... I always say that at weddings. So I'll just think of something else to say. I... [band starts playing]",Michael
Cheers.,Katy
"Hey, Jim. You got a hat?",Michael
Yeah.,Jim
Thanks.,Michael
[to Angela] So this is...,Phyllis
"[storms out of Michael's office] Well, we're not going to Florida.",Stanley
"Oh. Someplace with a pool, then?",Phyllis
[gives Phyllis a look],Stanley
"...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long. But it's good.",Oscar
"[off camera] Yeah, that's right.",Jim
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",Pam
Pam! It's Michael. Help me! I need help right now.,Michael
"Michael, what's wrong?",Pam
"I'm hurt, I have hurt myself. Oh my God!",Michael
"Ok, wait wait wait wait...",Pam
"Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!",Michael
"Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!",Pam
"No, I want you to pick me up.",Michael
What?,Jim
Ok...,Pam
What's going on?,Jim
"Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.",Pam
I am hurt. I hurt my foot.,Michael
I'm sorry? Pam.,Jim
[exasperated],Pam
What is going on?,Jim
I want to come to work. But I need you to come and pick me up. [Jim lunges across Pam's desk and puts Michael on speakerphone],Michael
OH GOD!,Michael
"Hey, whoa, Michael...",Jim
Oh God!,Michael
"It's, okay, it's Jim. Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.",Jim
"OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.",Michael
You burned,Jim
"I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.",Michael
"Pam, could you come get me?!",Michael
"Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.",Pam
"Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?",Michael
"Michael, you should stay home and rest.",Phyllis
There's no toilet paper here. Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper. Could you tell 'em that?,Michael
Can you hop?,Kevin
"I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.",Michael
[panicked] No one wants to pick me up!?,Michael
"[silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on?",Dwight
"Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.",Pam
I'm not sick! I'm burned!,Michael
I'm coming Michael!,Dwight
Oh...,Jim
I'm gonna save you!,Dwight
Don't... is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight.,Michael
Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!,Dwight
I don't want Dwight!,Michael
"Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend?",Pam
I don't have a girlfriend.,Michael
But you said that you went out with her this weekend.,Jim
"It was all made up. Just someone come, ok? Anyone. Anyone but Dwight.",Michael
[sounds of a car crash] What was that...,Jim
What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael's office window],Pam
Oh!,Jim
Ohhhhhh!,Pam
He hit the pole!,Jim
"It's broken right, he can't...",Jim
Oh my gosh.,Pam
"Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield] Ohhhhhh!",Jim
Oh my God!,Jim and Pam
Is he ok?,Pam
"He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!",Jim
Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!,Michael
"Morning everyone. Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out. Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing. I just want to be treated normally today. Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through.",Michael
"You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.",Pam
Did you explain why?,Michael
"No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.",Pam
"Burned my foot, Pam.",Michael
Please stop popping my cast. Thank you.,Michael
"So, where are you shipping your foot?",Jim
Ha ha ha. So where are you shipping...,Michael
Your foot?,Dwight
"Thank you. Pam, messages please?",Michael
You didn't have any.,Pam
"Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and...",Michael
And do my job?,Pam
"No, your job is being my friend, Pam. OW! God!",Michael
[holding mini-fan] It slipped.,Dwight
What?,Michael
Sorry.,Dwight
"It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.",Pam
"I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask.",Michael
"Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.",Pam
"No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.",Michael
"Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.",Dwight
What? Part of your duties are to what?,Michael
What?,Dwight
You just said 'part of your duties are to' something.,Michael
"No, I didn't.",Dwight
"Yes, you did. What is wrong with you?",Michael
What is wrong with,Dwight
Where is my cornbread?,Michael
Here you go.,Ryan
Thank you. Did you get all dark meat like I like?,Michael
Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.,Ryan
Where are the yams?,Michael
They were out of yams. I got you creamed spinach.,Ryan
Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?,Michael
Yes.,Ryan
And they had no yams?,Michael
They had no yams.,Ryan
How strange. Because they always have yams.,Michael
"Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport?",Dwight
You've seen one of these?,Pam
"Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid.",Dwight
Roy gave it to me for Christmas. I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it.,Pam
"Oh, no no no. Don't go there. I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.",Dwight
Really?,Pam
"Yeah, I'll write down the address for you. Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!",Dwight
"Oh! Ha, haha.",Pam
"Why would they all be...? Ok, see you later, Pan.",Dwight
Pan?,Pam
Pam... PAAAM!?,Michael
"Oh, God.",Pam
[phone rings] What.,Pam
Come here please.,Michael
Tell me before I come there.,Pam
I want you to rub butter on my foot.,Michael
No.,Pam
"Pam, please? I have Country Crock.",Michael
No.,Pam
"Uh, ow. Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!",Michael
These covers are totally indestructible.,Dwight
Really?,Pam
Yeah. Throw it. I promise it won't break. Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player],Dwight
"Oh no, it's broken.",Dwight
What?!,Pam
"No, it's fine. I told you it wouldn't break. You could throw it all day long.",Dwight
That is so cool. Thanks Dwight!,Pam
Yep.,Dwight
"So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.",Jim
"Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God! Dwight's kind of my friend!",Pam
"No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom. No, I'm not gonna call Jan. She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you?",Michael
Huh. Do you like candy?,Dwight
It's alright.,Angela
Cause you're sweeter than candy.,Dwight
What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing],Angela
Hey!,Angela
"Wow, you just dive right into it.",Toby
"You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it.",Ryan
"[loud noise in bathroom] No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!",Michael
"What, what happened?",Toby
I fell off the toilet. I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.,Michael
What do you need?,Toby
"Ugh, not you. Someone else. Get Pam.",Michael
I don't think Pam's gonna want to come into the men's room.,Toby
Get Ryan. He needs to lift me. [Ryan shakes his head] and he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel.,Michael
"Ryan, is, uh, dead.",Toby
"No, he's not.",Michael
Dead.,Toby
I just saw him.,Michael
"No. Can't, can't you just get up yourself? I... You only grilled your foot.",Toby
"Ugh, forget it. I'll just get up myself. No! Uh, aaaahhh! Ah! Oh God!",Michael
Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?,Jim
"No, he's actually been really nice and helpful.",Pam
And that isn't weird?,Jim
Wow...,Pam
"Can I have everyone's attention please? Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question? Do you all know what it's like to be disabled? Oscar?",Michael
"Um, I had scoliosis as a girl.",Phyllis
"No, never heard of it. No, a",Michael
"When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung.",Creed
"Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.",Michael
I'm not disabled and neither are you.,Stanley
"Ok, [lifts up cooked foot] what does this look like to you Stanley?!",Michael
"Mailboxes, Etc.",Stanley
"Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about. You people are jerks. Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.",Michael
"Oh, we wouldn't. We love Stevie Wonder.",Phyllis
"[sigh] I burned my foot!!! Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!",Michael
[looking up at Creed] Dad?,Dwight
"While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.",Michael
"Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?",Jim
Twice.,Ryan
"Good question. Forrest Gump: mentally challenged, Philadelphia [points to a picture from Big]: AIDS.",Michael
I think that's from Big.,Kevin
"I don't think so, no.",Michael
"Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.",Kelly
"He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works. [sigh] A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?",Michael
Uh hmmmm... .,Stanley
What you mean uh hmmm... ?,Michael
I mean I'm learning nothing.,Stanley
Ok.,Michael
"Michael Scott, I'm looking for Michael Scott.",Billy Merchant
"Yes, right in here, come on in.",Michael
Great.,Billy Merchant
"This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.",Michael
Sorry I'm late. Someone parked in the handicapped parking space.,Billy Merchant
"Hey everyone, I'm Billy Merchant, you may have seen me around here before, I'm the properties manager of this office park",Billy Merchant
You are so brave. You are so brave.,Michael
"Thank you. Actually, I've been meaning to come by here for a long time...",Billy Merchant
But it's hard for you! Right? Because you're in a wheelchair.,Michael
"No, I just have a lot of properties to manage.",Billy Merchant
"Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?",Michael
"I don't know, like 30 seconds?",Billy Merchant
"Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me.",Michael
How did you get in your wheelchair?,Michael
"This morning? Just like every other morning, just climbed on in. [Everyone laughs]",Billy Merchant
"Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.",Michael
"Hey, hey, relax, just jokin around here.",Billy Merchant
"Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor.",Michael
"Listen, I've actually used a chair since I was four years old. I don't really notice it anymore.",Billy Merchant
"Well they notice it. Don't you? You notice it. It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?",Michael
I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.,Jim
"So, there are just a couple things I want to remind everybody of...",Billy Merchant
Ok...,Michael
"First is parking. You can't block the freight entrance with your car, even if your blinkers are on. Does anybody have any questions? [to Dwight, whose arms is raised] Yes. Yeah? yes...",Billy Merchant
"Dwight, you have your hand up.",Pam
"Ignore him. You know what? We're not that different, you and I. When I clamped my foot into a non-stick...",Michael
You know what Michael?,Billy Merchant
Yeah...,Michael
Let me stop you right there.,Billy Merchant
Ok.,Michael
And leave.,Billy Merchant
Did you see Born on the Fourth of July? I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.,Michael
What's wrong with that guy?,Billy Merchant
You mean today? He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.,Jim
"No, not Michael. The moon-faced kid who crashed into the pole. He looks like he has a concussion.",Billy Merchant
[popping his bubble wrap cast] Hey!,Michael
I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!,Ryan
"You did it! Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin. Very nice. Thank you, Ryan.",Michael
You are very welcome.,Ryan
Did you get the yams?,Michael
"No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!",Ryan
"[sigh] Ok, I'll just have the pudding.",Michael
You sure?,Ryan
Yeh.,Michael
Ok.,Ryan
You know what? I feel better. Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.,Michael
"Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better. My body's literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.",Michael
I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding. I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.,Ryan
"Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.",Michael
"[hits his head on his desk] Uh, ugh, ohhhh...",Dwight
"Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.",Jim
"Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.",Michael
"He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact. I think that you should go with him.",Angela
Why don't you go with him?,Michael
"I, barely know him...",Angela
I want Michael to take me...,Dwight
"I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity.",Michael
You can take my van!,Meredith
"Oh, ok, that's, great. No, I can't drive. Jim why don't you drive.",Michael
Fine.,Jim
"We'll go. I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.",Michael
"Slowly, slowly. Let's just get to the elevator.",Jim
Choo choo choo choo choo choo...,Dwight
"What are you doing? What, stop...",Jim
Vietnam sounds.,Dwight
"[Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.",Jim
Tired... [Jim grabs spray bottle from planter],Dwight
You can't lay down.,Jim
Want to take a rake... .,Dwight
Wake up. [sprays Dwight],Jim

"Ok, Pam, thanks.",Dwight
"Get up, get up.",Pam

I know.,Pam
I have to go to the hospital.,Dwight
I know.,Pam
Where we going?,Dwight
I just want to say goodbye ok?,Pam
"I'll be back, I mean...",Dwight
"Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different.",Pam
Why?,Dwight
It's just hard to explain.,Pam
"Aw, Pam, you're adorable [taps her nose]",Dwight
Oh my goodness!,Pam
[giggles],Dwight
Come here.,Pam
"Oh, huggy hugs.",Dwight
Shotgun!,Michael
You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?,Jim
The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear. The first person to shout 'shotgun' when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat. That's how the game's played. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.,Michael
"Oh, God, a mini-van. What is Meredith's problem?",Michael
"Well, I think she has a kid.",Jim
"Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband. She's not gonna find one driving this thing around.",Michael
Where are we going?,Dwight
"Come on, get inside.",Jim
Where are we going?,Dwight
We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.,Jim
"Chuck E. Cheese? Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.",Michael
"We're going to the hospital, Michael.",Jim
"I know, just sayin'.",Michael
"Dwight, what are you drinking?",Michael
I found it under the seat.,Dwight
"Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.",Jim
I'm thirsty.,Dwight
Give the bottle to Michael [sprays Dwight],Jim
No!,Dwight
Give the bottle to Michael!,Jim
I'm thirsty!,Dwight
Give it to me.,Michael
No.,Dwight
Dwight... [to Jim] You just keep your eyes on the road. [to Dwight] Give me the bottle or you're fired.,Michael
"You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!",Dwight
Give it to me Dwight.,Michael
No. [takes a drink],Dwight
Give me the bottle!!,Michael
[to Michael] Will you stop?,Jim
"Gimme the bottle, Dwight!",Michael
Michael stop.,Jim
[drinks] Mmmmm...,Dwight
Just give it!,Michael
"Michael stop. [sprays Michael, then Dwight]",Jim
"Stop, stop it! Stop spraying! [Dwight whines] Gimme the bottle!",Michael
Stop [sprays Michael],Jim
My eyes!,Dwight
Stop spraying me! Gimme the bottle!,Michael
My eyes!,Dwight
"Dwight, what is your middle name.",Michael
Danger.,Dwight
[sigh] Something with a 'K'.,Michael
"It's Kurt. Wow, I am so sad that I know that.",Jim
What do I write under 'reason for visit'?,Michael
Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?,Jim
Nothing. I wrote 'bringing someone to the hospital'.,Michael
So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.,Jim
"No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore. I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. [Dwight falls towards Jim]",Michael
Come on Dwight. [sprays Dwight],Jim
Hi Michael!,Dwight
Hi Dwight.,Michael
Ahhh. Mweehaa,Dwight
"Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?",Michael
A head injury.,Doctor
"Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.",Michael
"[to Dwight] So, I'm ordering a CAT scan.",Doctor
What is that?,Dwight
"Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?",Michael
"Well, for a burn, you really just need to look at the outside of the foot.",Doctor
"Ok, what kinda machine is that?",Michael
Does the skin look red and swollen?,Doctor
That's what she said.,Dwight
"That's my joke, damnit Dwight.",Michael
"Ok, no electronics past this point. Camera, sound equipment...",Lab Tech
"It's ok, they're with me.",Michael
No metal of any kind.,Lab Tech
"Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.",Michael
I don't want to do this.,Dwight
"Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up. We'll, see you when you get out.",Michael
Oh.,Dwight
Fine. Fine.,Michael
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",Pam
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.",Jim
"Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?",Pam
"Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.",Jim
I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.,Pam
Michael went in there with him too. It's pretty sweet.,Jim
Really? Michael went in with him?,Pam
Uh huh.,Jim
Wow.,Pam
"But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.",Jim
"Ok, that's uh, good news [Pam sees Angela eavesdropping] Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go.",Pam
Ok.,Jim
Ok. Bye.,Pam
Bye.,Jim
"Hey, Oscar?",Pam
"What's up, Pam?",Oscar
"I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok. The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow.",Pam
Ok...,Oscar
"I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that.",Pam
"Ok Mr. Schrute, inhale with me on three. One, two, uh Sir? [Michael tries to put his leg in the scanner] Stop that. Stop. Stop that.",Lab Tech
[Jim popping Michael's bubble wrap cast] You should put butter on it.,Oscar
"Uh, that's what she said. See, haven't lost my sense of humor. No, no need, it was a non-stick grill.",Michael
"I've had a Foreman grill for about six years, I've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I've never burnt myself, probably because I don't use it as a pillow.",Jim
"I always keep a stash of bubble wrap at my house. Some days, hectic, tiring days, I just like to go home and zone out and click on the tube and pop a few. Very soothing. [to the interviewer] Want to try?",Michael
"You know, that's probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast.",Jim
"Right, I'm gonna spend the day in the hospital, bujehh. Bureaucracy and germs.",Michael
And doctors.,Jim
"Yes, so, no thank you.",Michael
Pssht.,Dwight
What?,Michael
"Constructing a home-made cast? Genius. Filled with foresight. Like in the pioneer times, if you lost a leg, they would then use the bone of the leg for a cane. They wasted nothing.",Dwight
"Wow, I don't want to hear... you talk. Pam, could I have a word with you in my office? [stumbling] Oh, oh, oh. Alright.",Michael
My assignment is to make a temporary disabled parking permit for Michael Scott.,Ryan
Ooo! Who made popcorn? [Michael rubbing butter on his foot],Angela
"[on speakerphone] Well you know, frankly a lot of us have been saying this for a long time.",Toby
"Yeah, I've been sayin that.",Michael
"Yeah, and I, uh, I think that the very fact that we're including it in our agenda frankly, is a big step forward.",Toby
Did you know I used to be in HR?,Michael
I'm sorry?,Toby
I used to be in HR. I was a Hell raiser.,Michael
"Uh, ok.",Toby
Right? [laughs],Michael
"Uh, great. Why don't we move on?",Toby
Alright. Movin' on.,Michael
Great. Because you that I think the very fact that [Michael mutes the call],Toby
"Ry-an. You're here. Whatcha got, whatcha got? Alright, Panic Room, Maverick, Nell, Sommersby, The Accused. Where's Little Man Tate?",Michael
They were out.,Ryan
Oh come on.,Michael
At three different places.,Ryan
"Oh man. It's not a Jodie Foster afternoon without Little Man Tate, buddy.",Michael
"Mmm, I'm telling you the best cure in the world is comfort food. You know how they say 'stuff a cold'? Well I don't care you've got, the flu, Lyme disease, emphysema, you eat an entire dark meat chicken, you can walk on the moon.",Michael
"Look, I feel fine. As a volunteer sheriff's deputy I have been trained to notice all the signs of a concussion. One of them is slurred speech, ok? Number three, shortness of breath. There are four things you have to remember. One: I am faster than 80% of all snakes. Also.",Dwight
We need to get your friend into the CT machine.,Doctor
"Into a machine?! Ok. Uh, that's bad, will you stay with me?",Dwight
No.,Michael
"Ok, will you please call my cousin Mose?",Dwight
"No, I'm not calling your weirdo cousin. Twenty-seven years old, never left the beet farm.",Michael
Oh God. Oh God.,Dwight
Guh-od.,Michael
Oh God.,Dwight
"Ok, I'll stand near you.",Michael
Next to me?,Dwight
Next-ish.,Michael
I'm gonna pull the car around.,Jim
Shh shh shh shh.,Michael
Do you speak Spanish?,Jim
No. Do you?,Michael
"No, I don't.",Jim
Not much what's up with you?,Jim
"Oh, I can not believe I fell for that. [laughing] Oh, my God.",Pam
"Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me.",Michael
"Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?",Jim
What's up-dog?,Michael
Nothin' much what's up with you?,Jim
"Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant!",Michael
"Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?",Michael
I'm on the phone.,Stanley
"Mmm, what flavour coffee is that? Up-dog?",Michael
What's that?,Ryan
"I don't know, nothin', what's up with you?",Michael
Huh?,Ryan
"[low] No, damn it!",Michael
What does that mean?,Kevin
What does what mean?,Michael
The thing you just said?,Kevin
Just forget it.,Michael
Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?,Michael
What's up-dog?,Dwight
"Gotcha! [laughing] Oh, God. [low] Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?",Michael
Good. How are you doing?,Dwight
[mouthing] So close.,Jim
[low] Damn it.,Michael
"Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don't have to do in the spring? Anything. They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind. Well I say that an empty desk means a...",Michael
Empty mind.,Dwight
"No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say.",Michael
"Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes. They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?",Dwight
He's out sick.,Angela
That's unacceptable.,Dwight
I agree it's unacceptable. [longing look],Angela
Whhh... What are you guys doing?,Kevin
Michael.,Dwight
Yes.,Michael
Oscar is out sick.,Dwight
On a Friday? [Dwight nods],Michael
Can I do some of the talking?,Dwight
I will do all the talking.,Michael
"Ok, let him know that I'm here.",Dwight
Hello.,Oscar
What difference does it make whether your here?,Michael
Hello?,Oscar
"Hi, Oscar its Michael.",Michael
And Dwight.,Dwight
"Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?",Michael
Yeah I think I came down with the flu.,Oscar
"Really? Oh, that is a shame. You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.",Michael
"Yeah, I feel terrible about it.",Oscar
Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.,Dwight
What are your symptoms?,Michael
I have the chills.,Oscar
"Umm, hmmm.",Michael
I feel nauseous and my heads killing.,Oscar
Checks out.,Dwight
Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.,Oscar
I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday. Unless you're still sick. So have a great long weekend.,Michael
I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish],Oscar
Ok. First impressions?,Dwight
He sounded sick.,Michael
Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.,Dwight
That's exactly what I was thinking.,Michael
Question? May I investigate?,Dwight
Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.,Michael
I bought my veil.,Pam
Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?,Kelly
Ummm...,Pam
"Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?",Kelly
"Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and...",Pam
You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry.,Kelly
"Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time. It's much sexier. [Pam puts hair back up] [Michael walks by Jim] Man, this must be torture for you.",Michael
Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.,Jim
Hey Michael.,Jim
Hey Jim-bag.,Michael
Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.,Jim
Really?,Michael
"Umm, hmm.",Jim
Who else knows?,Michael
Nobody.,Jim
Wow!,Michael
"Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship. And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.",Michael
My lips are sealed. [singing] My lips are sealed... Bangles.,Michael
Alright. Great. Thank you.,Jim
"[singing] Can you hear me, they talk about us...",Michael
Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning. Do you think you can handle it?,Dwight
"Yeah, I think I can handle it.",Ryan
Do you,Dwight
I think.,Ryan
"[low] Oh God, here.",Dwight
"Hey, whatcha gettin'?",Michael
I'm going with grape.,Jim
"Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?",Michael
Which one?,Jim
"Any of em? So, uh, what's the 411? Any news on the 'P' situation?",Michael
I don't know what you mean.,Jim
P-A-M. P-A,Michael
"Uh, uh, ok.",Jim
"No it's okay, we're talking code.",Michael
What is?,Stanley
Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?,Michael
I'm going to take off actually.,Jim
"Alright, well, cool. [Michael walks by Jim] Still deciding?",Michael
Hmm?,Stanley
[Michael presses a button for Stanley] Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it.,Michael
"Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling. Listen a little question for you, buddy. I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.",Dwight
"There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth. The liar will perspire. Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.",Dwight
It's Grrrrrrape! Soda.,Michael
Tony the tiger. You don't hear that much any more.,Jim
Not so much.,Michael
"Ok, what is going on here?",Dwight
Nothing.,Michael
"Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda. Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.",Dwight
Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.,Michael
Ok. So what is the secret Michael?,Dwight
"Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.",Jim
Is that true?,Dwight
"Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.",Michael
Thank you Michael. I know your telling the truth.,Dwight
Ok.,Michael
I can tell. I won't let you down.,Dwight
Good.,Michael
Thanks.,Jim
"Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick. What are you doin' for lunch?",Michael
I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.,Jim
"Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim's desk], no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.",Michael
"No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.",Jim
Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room. Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.,Michael
"Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea. Let's go out.",Jim
I know just he place.,Michael
"[at Hooters] Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?",Michael
"Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.",Michael
"Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o'clock. Hi.",Michael
Hey I'm Dana. Welcome to Hooters.,Dana
"We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.",Michael
Nope we're not brothers.,Jim
I'm his boss actually. And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.,Michael
"Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.",Jim
And for you?,Dana
"Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?",Michael
"Oh, it's great. It's served with our world famous wing sauce.",Dana
"Mmmm, sounds yummy. I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken. [Giggles]",Michael
Is that what you really want?,Dana
"No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog.",Michael
Great.,Dana
Who took all the black ones?,Dwight
That's a communal bowl.,Pam
"So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?",Dwight
"Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know.",Pam
Sniffling how?,Dwight
Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?,Pam
Three.,Dwight
"Ok, it was the second one.",Pam
"Ok, good, thank you. That wasn't so hard now was it?",Dwight
Nuh-uh.,Pam
What do you like best about Pam?,Michael
"Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.",Jim
"Is it her boobs, or...",Michael
"Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.",Jim
Really?,Michael
Uh-huh.,Jim
Never get's any of my jokes.,Michael
What about you?,Jim
"Her boobs, definitely.",Michael
"Wow, that's not what I meant.",Jim
Here you go.,Dana
"Oh, thank you.",Michael
And I understand we have a birthday today.,Dana
Ohhh happy birthday Jim!,Michael
Ready girls? Front side.,Dana
"You put your front side in; you put your front side out. You put your front side in and shake it all about. You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around. That's what it's all about. Whoo, hoo!",Hooter's Girls
Thank you.,Jim
Woo! Yeah!,Michael
"Thanks, thanks Dana.",Jim
Thank you very much.,Michael
Hilarious. Hey.,Michael
What did you guys talk about?,Pam
"[Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature.",Jim
I hate you.,Pam
Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.,Dwight
Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.,Michael
Including prep time?,Dwight
Just do it.,Michael
If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here. And I'd forget too.,Ryan
[Michael messes up hair to look like Jim's] Expenses.,Michael
Michael is that a wig?,Kevin
No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?,Michael
No.,Kevin
This is from Hooters.,Angela
"Yeah, it's a business lunch.",Michael
Did Toby approve this?,Angela
No he did not. I don't need his permission.,Michael
You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?,Toby
"Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?",Michael
I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter. And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.,Michael
I'm not processing this.,Toby
"Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity. How is that not work related?",Michael
He seems fine to me.,Toby
"You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged. So just cut me some slack. Please?",Michael
Pam?,Kelly
Angela who would you choose Jim or Roy?,Phylis
"It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy.",Angela
Jim has got it bad for Pam.,Kevin
Oh ho! Which one is Pam?,Creed
Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?,Kevin
"You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.",Michael
"As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years. One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me. So I tailed her for six straight nights. Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.",Dwight
"Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?",Kelly
Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting.,Jim
Nice... she is,Kevin
Hey.,Pam
Hey.,Jim
Did you find anything good in your desk?,Pam
"Ah, coupon for a free sandwich.",Jim
Score.,Pam
"It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.",Jim
Big day.,Pam
Big day.,Jim
"Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.",Jim
Oh.,Pam
"Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.",Jim
Right.,Pam
"And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.",Jim
"No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.",Pam
Oh you did?,Jim
"No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well.",Pam
"No, no, you saw through me, great.",Jim
So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?,Pam
"Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay.",Jim
"Mmm, hmm.",Pam
And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.,Jim
Cool.,Pam
Ok.,Jim
"Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all.",Dwight
Who's this?,Gil
This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?,Dwight
Gil.,Gil
Are you going to tell Michael?,Oscar
How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor. Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.,Dwight
"Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage. Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.",Dwight
Hey.,Jim
"I know, I know, I know.",Michael
"Umm, what happened?",Jim
"I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that [starts to get choked up] this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.",Michael
"Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.",Jim
"Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just.",Michael
"Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?",Jim
Yeah I'm good.,Michael
Good.,Jim
Creed did you organize the menu book?,Ryan
"Oh, I thought that was more on a volunteer basis.",Creed
"No, that was mandatory.",Ryan
"Oh, I thought it was a volunteer thing.",Creed
"Hey, here's your schedule for next week. Are you okay?",Pam
"Yeah I'm fine. Look, about you and Jim.",Michael
"Oh, no, that's, you don't have to.",Pam
"No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend.",Michael
"No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.",Pam
It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.,Michael
Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?,Pam
"Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out.",Michael
Ready?,Jim
Yep.,Pam
"People are always coming to me. 'Michael, I have a secret. Your the only one I trust.' No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend. This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.",Michael
Hello. Pammy want a cracker?,Michael
No thanks. You got a package.,Pam
"Oh, Pam with the dirty talk. [laughs]",Michael
"And he's lining it up. Seems pretty straightforward from here. If Michael Scott sinks it, he'll win a Buick signed by Tiger Woods.",Dwight
Oh!,Michael
"He totally misses,",Dwight
"No, he meant to put it right next to the hole, that's much harder to do.",Michael
"Interception. He shoots, he scores, yeah! Michael, try it like this. This'll be much harder.",Dwight
"No, no, no, no. I don't want to chip my mug. Please get that off the floor. [sets mug on the edge of Michael's desk]",Michael
All right. Jack Nicholson for birdie.,Michael
Jack Nicholas.,Dwight
It's a celebrity tournament.,Michael
[golf ball rolls under bookcase] I got it. No problem. [clears throat],Dwight
Do you see it?,Michael
"Oh, man, it's really back there.",Dwight
Do you feel it?,Michael
Yeah. I can barely...,Dwight
"[mug falls off Michel's desk and smashes on the floor] God... damn it, Dwight! That's great.",Michael
Should I clean out my desk?,Dwight
[pulls a brand new mug out of his desk door] That won't be necessary.,Michael
"Don't be fooled by the phrase 'dust bunnies.' They are vicious little bitches and if they get inside your disc drive, God help you. They will bring your computer to its knees. They sit in corners hatching, defecating, laying eggs. And their sole purpose in life is to eat dead skin, which humans in this office shed by the boat load. Especially Creed.",Dwight
"Look at all them out there, my little worker bees buzzing away.",Michael
"If they're the worker bees, you're the Queen bee.",Dwight
"No, I am the King bee,",Michael
Queen's higher.,Dwight
"No, King is higher. Then Ace. I am the Ace bee.",Michael
"People Magazine, crossword puzzle, keep or toss?",Ryan
Keep. I will finish that later.,Michael
It's from '99.,Ryan
"Yeah, I know when it's from, Ryan.",Michael
"18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.' Michael wrote, 'Judd?'",Ryan
"Yeah, I rushed a few fraternities, but you know what? I don't believe in paying for friendships. So, I made a decision not to accept any offers. And fortunately none were made. Which was good, so nobody's feelings got hurt.",Michael
"Temp, shouldn't you be monitoring the progress of people's cleaning efforts?",Dwight
Everything seems pretty much under control.,Ryan
"Yeah. Well, I'd hate to see it blow up in your face.",Dwight
How would...,Ryan
"Let's table that. So, temp... You seem to be pretty close to this Oscar.",Dwight
Not really.,Ryan
Getting defensive?,Dwight
No.,Ryan
You seem a little nervous. You shouldn't be.,Dwight
"Thank you, Dana.",Michael
Sure.,Dana
"Keep the change. Here you go buddy, happy birthday.",Michael
Wow. Thanks.,Jim
You're welcome.,Michael
"No, you what, seriously, you should have it.",Jim
"No, no, no, no. I have the long sleeve. And actually, you know what we should do? We should wear them tomorrow to work, it'll be hysterical.",Michael
"Oh, tomorrow, that's gonna be tough 'cause I already laid out my outfit, so...",Jim
"Okay, Tuesday. Whenever. You'd better try it on, make sure it fits.",Michael
[catching Jim looking at him at Pam's desk] What?,Ryan
"Oh, nothing.",Jim
"Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her. It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy. Uh... June. Summer. So, that'll be nice. And that's that.",Jim
[again catching Jim looking at him] What?,Ryan
"Oh, nothing.",Jim
"Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week. I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.",Ryan
Spamster!,Michael
"Um, Pam plus Spam plus...?",Pam
Hamster.,Michael
Right.,Pam
Welcome back! How was your vacation?,Michael
It was great.,Pam
Yeah?,Michael
Mm-hm.,Pam
Did you get lucky? Oh! Boink!,Michael
"Roy and I just got back from the Poconos. I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.",Pam
"I am Pam. Spicoli guy. Oh, God. Names, numbers. Okay. [walking into office] Whoa! God! Yuck, yuck. Yuck. Yuck!",Michael
What?,Pam
Wow! What happened in there?,Michael
I don't know.,Pam
"There is stink in there, my God! What is... what is that?",Michael
[looking at pile on Michel's carpet] Oh... I don't know.,Pam
Is it a bird?,Michael
"No, I don't think it's a bird.",Pam
"Oh, God! How could that happen? How could... right in the middle of the carpet.",Michael
What's goin' on?,Kevin
"Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.",Michael
[taking a look] I don't think that's vomit.,Kevin
Check it out.,Michael
Me?,Kevin
"Check it out. Don't be a wuss, just get... no, I'm not holding your coffee.",Michael
"Oh, that's ridiculous.",Kevin
What is it?,Michael
Michael. [tapping on door],Kevin
"What is it? No, just tell me what it is.",Michael
"[pounding on door] Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here. I can't hold my breath that long.",Kevin
Open the door up!,Pam
It smelled,Kevin
"[after going in to check out the smell] Phew. Oh! No, mm-mm. [leaving quickly]",Pam and others
I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.,Michael
That's no burst pipe.,Toby
"How do you know that? What is it, then?",Michael
Hi guys. Somebody makin' soup?,Creed
[as cleaning lady with mask leaves] Here she comes. All cleaned? Great. [walks into office],Michael
[coughing] It's still stinky.,Dwight
That is worse.,Michael
She probably scrubbed it,Dwight
"[while in his reeking office] I am a big Fear Factor fan. I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape. Um... [clearing throat] I can't stand it [gets up to leave], I can't stay in here another second. No!",Michael
Hey! Welcome back!,Jim
Thanks!,Pam
"So, how was the resort? Did you ski a lot?",Jim
A little.,Pam
Good! What's goin' on here?,Jim
What? I did not do that. That sounds disgusting.,Jim
[barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me. Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me.,Ryan
[smelling the stink] Oh. Wow.,Jim
[giggles at Roy],Pam
[sitting at Jim's desk] Hey Jim. I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.,Michael
That might be a little difficult with the one computer.,Jim
Oh... It's ...,Michael
But there's definitely a desk open in the back.,Jim
[reluctantly] Yeah ...,Michael
...which I guess I'll be taking.,Jim
"No, no, no! Seriously, I don't mind sharing.",Michael
"No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back.",Jim
"Hey, Kelly.",Jim
Are you moving back here?,Kelly
"Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk.",Jim
"Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.",Kelly
Allergy to... the desk?,Jim
[shaking head] Weird.,Kelly
"[putting his feet on desk] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Old bullpen.",Michael
[putting his feet on desk] Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.,Dwight
Don't ape me.,Michael
Okay.,Dwight
This is great.,Michael
Yeah!,Dwight
The pressures of my office are insane.,Michael
[agreeing] Mm.,Dwight
"I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know? I used to sit right here.",Michael
No way!,Dwight
Yeah.,Michael
And who had your office?,Dwight
"Ed Truck. [exclaiming is disgust] Ed Truck was the manager before me. Horrible. He hated fun. It was like, 'Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us. Stop having fun. Start pretending to do work.' What a jerk. He's... You know what? I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.",Michael
"[to Jim] I'm serious. My closet doors will not shut. I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big? So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that. So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...",Kelly
You know who used to sit at that desk?,Michael
That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?,Dwight
Mm-mm. Todd Packer.,Michael
No!,Dwight
Yeah.,Michael
I thought he was out on the road.,Dwight
"He was, but, uh... that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes.",Michael
Ah.,Dwight
"When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office [picture behind Michael falls]. Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that",Michael
I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.,Michael
"[on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer?",Stanley
"Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm. [laughs] Okay.",Michael
"Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute. Guy had no sense of humor about it. Probably why he wasn't hired.",Michael
[after Michael punches him in the arm] What did you hit me for?,Creed
Charley horse!,Michael
What?,Creed
Charley horse!,Michael
"You shouldn't have hit me, Michael.",Creed
"Oh, okay. Gah.",Michael
"Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office. [giggles] It was hysterical.",Michael
"[to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones...",Kelly
"Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.",Ryan
It's the lever on the side.,Jim
That's what I told him. Thanks. [leaves],Ryan
"Oh my God, he is so cute! Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?",Kelly
"No, I don't think I can...",Jim
"Oh, please Jim? Please, please, Jim. Please, please, please? He's so cute. I like him",Kelly
[whispering] Dwight.,Michael
[whispering] Michael.,Dwight
Let's send up Accounting.,Michael
What?,Dwight
Old fashioned raid. Sales on Accounting. Yeah. Follow my lead.,Michael
Hey guys.,Michael
"Hey, Michael.",Oscar
Ahem. What's up?,Michael
"Hey, Dwight.",Oscar
"[as they throw accountants' files and supplies around] Ahhhh! Whoo hoo! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Sales rules!",Michael and Dwight
Yeah! [laughing],Dwight
Yeah! Oh ho ho [laughing],Michael
Should we help 'em pick up their stuff?,Dwight
"No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that.",Michael
Okay.,Dwight
"Watch out, Pam. You're next!",Michael
You're gonna throw my things on the ground?,Pam
Maybe!,Michael
"What happened in Michael's office was wrong. I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure] But it... it was still wrong.",Oscar
"Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet? I don't know. It could be done out of hate. It could be done out of love. It could be completely neutral. Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady. And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe. I hate her.",Michael
You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense.,Michael
"[on phone] Hello, am I the 107th caller? [hangs up, dials again] Hello, Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and dials again] Hell , Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and begins to dial again] I'm totally gonna win us that box set.",Dwight
Stop.,Michael
Jethro Tull...,Dwight
Stop it. [Dwight hangs up] Stop. It. [Dwight beings to dial] Don't. Don't.,Michael
I need to make a sales call. Please?,Dwight
All right.,Michael
"[on phone, whispering] Am I the 107th caller?",Dwight
[to Roy in Jim's earshot] ...back so soon.,Pam
"We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe.",Roy
"Yeah, right.",Pam
"Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President's Day or something.",Roy
"Yeah, that's right. We could do a three-day weekend. I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday. Then I get a four-day weekend.",Pam
"[to unseen co-worker] But it's so weird to fall asleep. And I just hate it. 'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30.",Kelly
[to Roy as Jim escapes into bathroom] Are you kidding?,Pam
No.,Roy
"Hi, guys.",Michael
We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.,Angela
I'm just walking around.,Michael
Were you?,Angela
"Well, yeah.",Michael
"It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.",Oscar
"Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you? I'm workin' for the week. Sales team, listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally. Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good?",Michael
Yeah!,Dwight
"[counting cash] Seventy, eighty, one, two three. Eighty-three dollars. Still a lotta money and I'm going to ... [moves money after seeing workmen walk by] ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it. I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest. Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we?",Michael
You're gonna compete against us?,Phyllis
"Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!",Michael
It is so on!,Dwight
"God, this is gonna be fun.",Michael
Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!,Dwight
"[on phone] So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring. Very good, nice doing business with you. Thank you. [hangs up] Yes! [chuckles] Oh, yeah! Read it and weep. Oh! Oh, look at that! [puts post-it on Phyllis' forehead] Look at me, Phyllis! Oh, what is that? That's my sale! [humming then dancing victoriously]",Michael
[walking by with new carpet] What... What's that? Whatcha doing?,Darryl
[stops dance] Nothing.,Michael
[laughing] I think he's dancing.,Roy
No. Just ...,Michael
That was definitely not dancing.,Darryl
"You know what, guys? It's none of your concern. It was official business, so just...",Michael
Paper business.,Darryl
"Yeah, paper business. Is this done?",Michael
Nope.,Roy
"Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour. If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that. [snaps]",Michael
Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know.,Pam
[to Oscar] Who do you think did it?,Creed
Are you kidding? I thought it was you.,Oscar
Really? I thought you. [both laugh in Michael's earshot],Creed
This was no act of God. A person did this. A person who works in this office. Maybe all of them.,Michael
You know what? Today is not a good day for a sales contest. We're... we're not... we're not doin' this today.,Michael
That doesn't seem fair.,Pam
"You wanna talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.",Michael
But you're the one who picked today.,Dwight
I am a victim of a hate crime. Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about.,Michael
That's not what a hate crime is.,Stanley
"Well I hated it! A lot! Okay, I... you know what? If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done . [no one comes forward] Very well. Then you are all punished.",Michael
What's our punishment?,Pam
"You're all on a time out. Just sit there quietly. [phone rings, Phyllis reaches to answer] No. NO! [phone continues to ring]",Michael
Hey!,Jim
What's up?,Ryan
Nothing much. Let me ask you something. It's actually little awkward.,Jim
What?,Ryan
What do you think of Kelly?,Jim
I don't know. Depends if you like a little junk in ... [notices camera] Umm... She's really cool.,Ryan
Are you interested in her?,Jim
"Yeah, totally.",Ryan
Really?,Jim
Did she say something?,Ryan
She said lots of things.,Jim
Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?,Ryan
I have no idea.,Jim
Can you find out?,Ryan
Yeah. Sure.,Jim
"[to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely. Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay? Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything. I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows?",Kelly
Do you remember Ed Truck?,Michael
Sure. He hired me. How's he doing?,Creed
How would I know?,Michael
I thought you might.,Creed
My biggest fear is turning into him.,Michael
"Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that.",Creed
"[sighs] I wasn't talking literally, Creed. Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy? Why am I talking to you?",Michael
[meeting Ed Truck in parking lot] Ed? Hi. Thanks for meeting me. Must be kinda neat comin' back.,Michael
Yeah. Should we go upstairs?,Ed
"Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now.",Michael
"So, what's the problem with my pension?",Ed
"Oh, no, no, no. You're good. It was clerical. You're good. Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.",Michael
"Well, what was done?",Ed
"I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.",Michael
"Yeah, somebody once did that in my office.",Ed
Really?,Michael
Yeah.,Ed
"Well, that figures. So how did you deal with people not liking you?",Michael
You can't expect to be friends with everybody.,Ed
Well... s-sure I can.,Michael
No. They'll always think of you as a boss first.,Ed
Not necessarily. You can love a boss like you do a father.,Michael
I'm not sure that ever happens.,Ed
"Well, okay. Different management styles.",Michael
"Why can't your workers be your workers, family be your family, your friends be your friends?",Ed
"Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office. I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them. But now, no. I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did. I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, 'Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends. Go get yourself a monkey kidney.'",Michael
"[on phone] Hey, Brenda. This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat. And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right? Um, so gimme a call back. You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one. Yikes. Uh... give me a call back, I hope. I'll talk to you later. Bye.",Jim
You just asked a girl out on the phone!,Kelly
Yep.,Jim
[on phone] Yes.,Michael
"Hello, yes. I'm looking for a gay nerd named Michael Scott.",Todd Packer
Who is this? How did you get this number?,Michael
"Your mom, you gay nerd!",Packer
Oh my God. Packer. Packster. Whacky Pack. How you doin'?,Michael
"Hey, did you get that package I left for you?",Todd
Uh... no. Did anybody see a package here today? No. How big was it?,Michael
It was pretty big.,Packer
Really?,Michael
Yeah.,Packer
Did you see a big package? Where did you leave it?,Michael
Left it in the middle of your office.,Packer
"Really? Guys, did you see a big package in my office?",Michael
You mean the thing?,Roy
[laughs uproariously],Packer
Are you kidding me? Oh!,Michael
Special delivery!,Packer
"That was Packer! Oh, you're... you are dead. You are dead, my friend! That is hilar... Oh, God! Of course it was you.",Michael
"Sit on the throne, Michael.",Packer
"Oh. [laughs and claps] Yeah, yeah! Oh my God. It was Packer!",Michael
"It takes an advanced sense of humor. I don't expect everybody to understand. It was done out of love, just like I thought. It's ah... God, these people are so... these are good people. We have fun. [giggles] We just have fun! Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out.",Michael
You have seven unheard messages.,Jim's voicemail
"[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, Jim. It's Pam. I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible. Anyway, I'm bored. Come back!",Pam
"[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, guess what? I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head. It's working. I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.",Pam
"[voicemail message for Jim] Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.",Pam
"[voicemail message for Jim] I'll transfer you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold, please. Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry. Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you.",Pam
"[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe? Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.",Pam
"[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow.",Pam
"[voicemail message for Jim] Calling from my cell phone. I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy. Everybody in the office. We need to talk.",Pam
"I think this whole disaster on Michael's carpet happened for a good reason. Him sitting next to me is a huge gift. This girl I know would say that it was a gift from God, but I don't know about all that.",Dwight
"Obviously, this was Kevin. This is his sense of humor exactly.",Angela
"There are so many people with motives, even me. Almost everyone is a suspect. Whoever did this is a genius. [laughs]",Kevin
"That looks, cool, where is that?",Kelly
What?,Jim
"That hotel, it looks so romantic.",Kelly
"Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos. I was just surfing.",Jim
"I went with my parents to the Shadowbrook Farm once. That was also really romantic. Oh, my God, I wish a boy would take me there. I would need a fun new top. You know what a great color is on me? Lavender, actually.",Kelly
Just give me one second. I'm just gonna grab something to eat.,Jim
Hey.,Jim
Hey.,Toby
"So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?",Jim
Mmm-hmm.,Toby
"And then you just changed desks, right?",Jim
Yeah.,Toby
To one without a cubicle.,Jim
Yeah.,Toby
"So, you just couldn't take it anymore, huh?",Jim
What are you talking about?,Toby
"So, that's how it's gonna be.",Jim
Yeah.,Toby
"Honestly, I don't even hear her anymore. It's like waves crashing against the beach.",Toby
"[on the phone] Okay, that quantity of cotton fiber will cost you... my screen disappeared. I know. I will click on the bottom and... Yes. I'm getting one of those little hourglass things. Used to have a price chart on the wall, now it's a little hourglass thing with an arrow next to it. Now it's just an hourglass thing. Uh-huh, yeah, well, or I can call you back. Okay.",Michael
"[on the phone] Excellent, good, good. Well, our truck is going out first thing tomorrow morning. So...",Dwight
"...cases of typical format and coated white paper. Okay, thanks again so much. All right, bye-bye.",Stanley
"20 cartons of it's coming, on it's way.",Phyllis
What's going on? Anything here?,Michael
Yes.,Stanley
"Yes, yes. What yes? A sale or a lead or...",Michael
A sale.,Stanley
Ah. Small?,Michael
Big.,Stanley
Huge?,Michael
Just big.,Stanley
Would you say the sale that I made earlier was huge or...,Michael
Big.,Stanley
"[on the phone] Good. No, I completely understand, times are a little tight right now. If it's alright with you though, I will just give you a call back next month. Great, thank you so much. Goodbye.",Dwight
What was that?,Michael
What?,Dwight
"You call that a sales call? My God, what have they been teaching you?",Michael
"You're the one who trained me, Michael.",Dwight
"Yeah, well, did I teach you to roll over like a submissive dog?",Michael
You most certainly did not.,Dwight
"No, I did not.",Michael
What can I do better?,Dwight
"Exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke.",Michael
I'm not good at jokes.,Dwight
Do you know a joke?,Michael
My cousin Mose told me a joke.,Dwight
Call a client right now.,Michael
Okay.,Dwight
And tell him the joke.,Michael
I will.,Dwight
Strike while the iron's hot. A joke always works.,Michael
"[on the phone] Yes, Howard Gruber, please.",Dwight
Just sell it.,Michael
"[on the phone] Howard, hello. Dwight Schrute. Dunder Mifflin. Yes, and you are my favorite client. Listen, I'm calling you to tell you a little joke. What is black and white and red and can't think? A nun who has a beet for a head. ... No, I'm Catholic, too.",Dwight
Give me the phone.,Michael
[on the phone] I understand.,Dwight
Give me the phone.,Michael
"[on the phone] If I was offensive in any way, I...",Dwight
Tell him. Tell him that your supervisor is on the line.,Michael
[on the phone] Humor works in...,Dwight
The old one two. Let's do it.,Michael
[on the phone] ...crazy ways. I'm going to pass you off to my supervisor. Hold on one second. [whispering] Howard Gruber. It's Howard Gruber.,Dwight
"[on the phone] Hey Howard. Michael Scott here. Yeah, sorry about that. Dwight is an idiot. I know. No, he's a little... Little dim. He's the janitor's brother, so...",Michael
That's not true.,Dwight
"[on the phone] Uh-huh? Yeah. Well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can't even find their way to work? That is Dwight.",Michael
[whispering] He's my best customer.,Dwight
"[on the phone] What can we do to help you out? You know what? I have a discount. Today and today only, on lightweight copier paper.",Michael
"But that's my sale. This is my sale, Michael!",Dwight
"[on the phone] Uh-huh, yes, I can do that. Absolutely! Perfect. Oh, I'm glad it timed out that way.",Michael
"What Michael doesn't understand is that when I worked in the fast food industry I was actually commended by management for the three 'M's. McService, McCompetence and McPunctuality.",Dwight
[laughing] You gotta drink on that one. Too bad.,Roy
"Hell yeah, yeah, yeah. Mo'fo, mo'fo.",Darryl
You ready?,Roy
Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you've got to drink.,Darryl
"Okay, look, I know what you're gonna say. That I'm not standing up for myself. But you know what? It's complicated and I really don't appreciate all the badgering.",Dwight
You could out-sell Michael any day.,Angela
"I really thought these people were my friends. My best friend since kindergarten, Elliot, that's a friend. Best friend ever. I should call him. Wonder where he lives.",Michael
"So, I'm happy to be here. It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well.",Jan
Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times.,Pam
"Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...",Jan
"[knocks] Hey, what's going on?",Michael
Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.,Jan
Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.,Michael
What are you doing?,Jan
"Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads...",Michael
Michael.,Jan
"No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby. But I just... just want to keep it within reason.",Michael
Michael.,Jan
They did this up in Albany...,Michael
You are not allowed in this session.,Jan
And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so...,Michael
Now you're really not allowed in this session.,Jan
"Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like...",Michael
I'm your boss.,Jan
[stands up] Anybody want any coffee or...,Michael
"We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.",Jan
"Women in the workplace... yeah, translation 'I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls.' Oh! Sorry. 'Women of the workplace.' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!",Michael
"Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize.",Jan
Jan.,Pam
"Yes, Pam?",Jan
Michael's still at the door.,Pam
Michael!,Jan
[in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?,Jan
It's a terrible idea.,Dwight
What is?,Jim
Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.,Dwight
"Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You're a guy... too... sort of. Let's do this!",Michael
"[in the background] Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap.",Michael
Let's just clap. Ready? [clapping] Yeah! Yeah!,Michael
Yeah!,Dwight
That's what I'm talking about!,Michael
"I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,",Jan
Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.,Michael
... but it's very destructive.,Jan
Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?,Michael
"Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?",Jan
We have nowhere else Jan. This...,Michael
We could do it in the warehouse.,Dwight
"Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.",Jan
"OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.",Michael
"Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months.",Michael
Remember on Lost when they met the Others?,Dwight
"I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?",Jan
Mmmhmm.,Pam
Please? Thank you. very much.,Jan
"So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?",Michael
My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.,Darryl
"You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.",Michael
Why?,Roy
Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy...,Michael
I don't understand.,Roy
Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing.,Michael
[talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.,Kevin
"Thanks for the head's up, Kev.",Jim
I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.,Kevin
[points at math equasion on chalkboard] Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little 'Good Will Hunting' situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.,Michael
Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.,Jan
Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations.,Meredith
Great. Phyllis?,Jan
"I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.",Phyllis
[disbelieving] Really?,Angela
I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...,Phyllis
No. Okay. Stop. Go on...,Jan
I've seen some of your spreadsheets.,Angela
Really? I thought they were pretty...,Phyllis
I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...,Pam
"Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam.",Roy
"Oh, no, no. No.",Jim
"No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right?",Roy
Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.,Jim
"You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.",Roy
Yeah. I like talking to her too.,Jim
"So, we're cool, right?",Roy
Yes. Yeah.,Jim
All right.,Roy
"Yep. Cool, man.",Jim
Sweet.,Roy
[blows a sigh of relief],Kevin
"Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.",Darryl
"Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there.",Michael
The experience...,Darryl
Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?,Michael
Okay. Let's go. Step up.,Dwight
Check this out! Look at that! Look at that [squeezes blow-up doll] bwup-bwa! [talks in girly voice] Hello! How are... [regular voice] Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.,Michael
"In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober.",Meredith
That is an excellent goal.,Jan
Four and a half.,Meredith
I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.,Kelly
Great! Uh-huh?,Jan
I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.,Kelly
[general murmuring of agreement],Women
"Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.",Jan
Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.,Dwight
Ponies.,Jim
No.,Dwight
How about rainbows?,Ryan
No.,Dwight
Flowers.,Jim
"It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.",Darryl
"Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself.",Michael
Mike.,Darryl
Stand clear.,Michael
Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.,Darryl
"I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.",Michael
"Look, would ya... look.",Darryl
"Oh, oh, oh! We'll get somebody to clean that up.",Michael
We're the ones that got to clean that up!,Darryl
"Dammit, Michael!",Lonny
We ought to have this thing serviced.,Michael
"So! Guy's gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That's going to happen, you know. We're guys, so...",Michael
"Hey, do you want me to go?",Madge
"No, why? Why would I... ? You could...",Michael
I'll go.,Madge
Stay or...,Michael
...and a big walk-in closet.,Phyllis
"Oh, that's part of my dream too.",Meredith
"Oh, me too.",Kelly
"Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?",Jan
"Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.",Pam
She's real good.,Phyllis
Thanks.,Pam
You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.,Jan
"Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off...",Pam
"Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.",Jan
"Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um...",Pam
There are always a million reasons not to do something.,Jan
"Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?",Michael
My priority is safety.,Darryl
OK.,Michael
"So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.",Darryl
"OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh...",Michael
Uh uh uh. Don't shush me.,Darryl
I... That was just...,Michael
That bothers me too.,Darryl
I was breathing.,Michael
Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy.,Roy
"I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.",Michael
"You know that's a good question, Hasselhoff. What bugs us?",Lonny
OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it.,Michael
All right. Let's talk about clothing.,Jan
I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk.,Phyllis
"Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.",Jan
"I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.",Angela
I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like 'When are we going to go on a date-date?',Roy
I hate that too! [general clapping and agreement],Guy
I hate that too.,Darryl
That sucks so much.,Kevin
It totally sucks.,Guy
Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like 'Gas ain't free!',Dwight
"Yeah, on our salaries, man, what do they expect? You know to take us out every weekend? You know what I mean? We're not millionaires.",Lonny
I feel you.,Michael
"No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?",Darryl
Not literally.,Dwight
"You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.",Darryl
Yes.,Michael
We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder,Darryl
"Ah, you do. So...",Michael
But we get paid a lot less.,Darryl
Word.,Dwight
Like next to no benefits.,Roy
I know. God! What is that?,Michael
Exactly.,Roy
"It blows. It blows, man. Gah...",Michael
You know this would not happen if we had a union.,Darryl
That's what I'm talking about.,Roy
"No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.",Michael
Absolutely.,Roy
That's what we need.,Darryl
You know you're right.,Guy
"Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.",Darryl
You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.,Michael
"It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?",Darryl
In my truck.,Roy
Dockworker's?,Michael
"Man, hook you up.",Darryl
[generalized clapping],Men
"Come on, man.",Guy
Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.,Michael
"Union! Union, yeah.",Darryl
The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.,Michael
Are you with us Mike?,Darryl
Yeah-es.,Michael
Welcome to the warehouse.,Darryl
"Michael, Michael, Michael, Mi...",Group chant
Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...,Jan
"[knocks] This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points...",Michael
What? A union! What...,Jan
Don't get hysterical.,Michael
I'm not...,Jan
Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.,Michael
Let's... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons?,Michael
"The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?",Jan
Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.,Michael
"You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.",Jan
But we're bonding down there!,Michael
That's too bad.,Jan
I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear.,Michael
I don't want to...,Jan
Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through...,Michael
Michael! Michael! Michael!,Jan
We have a history...,Michael
Michael.,Jan
...between us.,Michael
Don't say another word.,Jan
I won't,Michael
Get yourself down stairs.,Jan
I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.,Michael
You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.,Ryan
This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.,Stanley
"Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...",Jan
Mistake.,Phyllis
Slip.,Meredith
"Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.",Jan
What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?,Kelly
Excuse me?,Jan
"I mean that's a baseball term, right?",Kelly
I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.,Jan
[in the background] ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.,Kelly
"[in the background] Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about.",Jan
[in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...,Kelly
Hey.,Pam
Hey!,Jim
How's it going down there?,Pam
"It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?",Jim
Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.,Pam
Did you really?,Jim
No. [laughs],Pam
Oh.,Jim
Almost.,Pam
Good.,Jim
"Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.",Pam
"Nice. Well, what's it all about?",Jim
Um...,Pam
I think you should do it. That's great!,Jim
It's really cool.,Pam
"Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?",Michael
Are you married?,Angela
I'm divorced.,Jan
That must have been hard.,Phyllis
It was. Yes.,Jan
You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.,Kelly
I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.,Jan
"Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.",Phyllis
"At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.",Angela
Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.,Jan
How can someone so beautiful be so sad?,Kelly
Hi.,Michael
Did you take care of the situation?,Jan
"Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially...",Michael
Excuse me.,Jan
I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some...,Michael
"Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.",Jan
Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.,Pam
So you're not doing it.,Jim
How did you know?,Pam
Why not?,Jim
Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.,Pam
Come on.,Jim
Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.,Pam
Roy said that.,Jim
What? You have something you want to say?,Pam
"You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?",Jim
"Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!",Pam
You are?,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
"It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... .",Pam
I'm just going to put this over there.,Michael
This is not a good idea right here.,Darryl
You did uh... okay.,Michael
Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza. Poor people love pizza. White people love pizza. Black people love pizza. Do black people like pizza?,Michael
"Hey. Um... look guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch.",Michael
Generalized mumbling agreement. Yeah.,All the Men
"Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.",Michael
Thank you to our hosts.,Michael
Hey Michael. This ain't over.,Darryl
Ahhh! Excellent.,Michael
Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.,Michael
"Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please.",Pam
"Oh! I don't know, Pam. I paid $400 for this phone because I liked the ring.",Michael
You did?,Pam
"And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I'm a little overwhelmed.",Michael
Yeah.,Pam
There's a lot of choices. You got to help me here.,Michael
Okay.,Pam
Which one of these is coolest? What do you think? [classical piano playing] [violin playing],Michael
How about that one?,Pam
"No, no. [blues piano playing]",Michael
"Oh, that one was good.",Jim
"Dude, are you kidding me? No. That one says, 'I am so lame.' Know which one I want? There's one that sounds like a jackhammer. Just really grabs your attention. It's like... [imitating jackhammer] You know what I'm talking about?",Michael
Do you mean vibrate?,Jim
Yes.,Michael
Bushmaster's hard to beat for long distance. It's a great point.,Roy
Yeah. I got a spudgun in my car.,Dwight
Really?,Roy
"Yeah. Shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 PSI, bon appetit!",Dwight
What are you guys talking about?,Michael
[at the same time] Guns.,Dwight and Roy
Cool.,Michael
How's that union stuff coming?,Roy
Working on it.,Michael
Yeah.,Roy
Yup.,Michael
Okay.,Roy
All right.,Michael
Guys! Check it out! Spudgun! Woohoo! Bon appetit! [Darryl's office window shatters] Sorry.,Dwight
That's my office.,Darryl
"There was this film that I saw when I was little. It was about a kid who goes on the most incredible adventure. And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, 'There's no place like home.' And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home. What the hell was that movie called? [sighs] It's gonna drive me crazy.",Dwight
"I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and...",Pam
[Delivery man enters with a bouquet of red roses. Pam stands up to look at card.] Phyllis.,Pam
Would you sign here? [Phyllis gets up from desk and walks over.],Delivery man
"Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.",Pam
"Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.'",Meredith
Isn't he sweet?,Phyllis
Yeah. Wow.,Meredith
"Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. [Dwight holds up passport.] Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.",Michael
And you want me to come with you.,Dwight
Nope. The opposite of that.,Michael
I will stay here and run things on this end.,Dwight
"Ok, good.",Michael
Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?,Dwight
"I probably will, why do you ask?",Michael
"Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...",Dwight
Yeah.,Michael
Screwed.,Dwight
What,Michael
"This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love.",Michael
"Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?",Michael
That's OK.,Pam
Alright.,Michael
"The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.",Oscar
"Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!",Michael
"Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.",Michael
"So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.",Jim
What's this? What is this?,Dwight
"I dunno, it's on",Jim
"Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?",Dwight
It was there when I sat down.,Jim
[opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine's Day. [pulls out bobble head] It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!,Dwight
"The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice. [Michael walks toward Sbarro.]",Michael
Hey Kelly. What's up?,Jim
"Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.",Kelly
"OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away]",Jim
"And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like 'Ryan, what's taking you so long?' And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.",Kelly
Wow.,Jim
"So I said, 'Ryan, what took you so long?' And I just said that to him, can you believe that?",Kelly
Wow.,Jim
"Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.",Kelly
"No, don't be.",Jim
"Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.",Kelly
I bet.,Jim
"So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.",Kelly
Alright. [Kelly squeals],Jim
[anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.,Ryan
"Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. [points] We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.",Michael
Woah. [Delivery man with flowers],Kevin
Guess what?,Pam
"Really, Oh, they're from Bob again.",Phyllis
That's great. [Meredith scowls],Pam
"Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to [turns and rushes back up stairs] Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.",Michael
"This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey [points]. That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? [walks over] OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were [Conan O'Brien walks in front of Michael], OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. [to camera] Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.",Michael
"Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.",Dwight
"Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.",Angela
Oh I did. I did.,Dwight
I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day.,Angela
"Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.",Dwight
"Really? Well, I hope I do.",Angela
"I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. [Michael sees it's the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back, should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.",Michael
"[on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.",Jim
"Woah, woah [Delivery man with oversized bear]",Kevin
Phyllis Lapin.,Delivery man
"OH, Holy God!",Pam

"Josh Porter, high five. [They high five] Bam.",Michael
You know Dan Gore from Buffalo.,Josh
"Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. [bump fists]",Michael
What's up buddy?,Craig
"You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?",Michael
"Guilty, yeah.",Craig
So what's going on? What I miss?,Michael
"Not much, they're uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we're just waiting for the presentations.",Josh
"Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... [awkward silence]",Michael
"Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?",Dwight
"You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.",Pam
"No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room]",Dwight
You need to get something for your girlfriend.,Pam
"[same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...",Dwight
Tightly wound?,Pam
(smirking) Exactly.,Dwight
"Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.",Pam
"You mean, like a ham?",Dwight
"No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.",Pam
"Ok, I get it.",Dwight
That you remember her.,Pam
"Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]",Dwight
"What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?",Josh
"Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said 'You gotta fire four people,' and I was just like, 'What?' Ya know?",Craig
Did you?,Josh
"No, I just ignored her. She's the worse.",Craig
She is our boss.,Josh
She ain't my boss dude. I don't work for that bitch.,Craig
"Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.",Michael
What? You like Jan? How can you,Craig
"Maybe because she's my girlfriend. [starts retracting statement] Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and...",Michael
You hooked up with Jan?,Josh
"You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,",Michael
"Yeah, let's change the subject.",Josh
"Yeah, yeah.",Michael
"I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.",Kelly

Nice to meet you.,Josh
"And Michael Scott, Scranton.",Jan
Nice to meet you.,David
Ditto. [to Jan] How are you Jan?,Michael
Fine Michael. Thank you.,Jan
OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to...,David
"Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.",Jan
"So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets.",Josh
Thanks very much.,David
Thank you.,Josh
"OK, Michael.",David
"What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. [plays video on screen. David and Jan have confused looks on their faces.]",Michael
"[video dialogue for 'The Faces of Scranton'] Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. [video shows Stanley at desk] This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.",Michael
"Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about.",Michael
"[video dialogue] And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants. Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. [video says, 'Great Scott!']",Michael
Questions?,Michael
"Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.",David
"Yes, thank you.",Michael
"But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?",David
"Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm... [hands over report]",Michael
[with flowers] Can you sign?,Delivery man
Yeah.,Pam
[delivering plant to Oscar's desk] Oscar.,Pam
Nothing for me?,Angela
[walks away] Join the club.,Pam
Whose it from? [to Oscar],Kevin
My mom. [puts card in pocket],Oscar
"It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.",Kelly
"You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.",Jim
"Yeah, it would be so great if he was.",Kelly
"Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.",Jim
"Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]",Kelly
"And that about does it, thank you.",Dan
"OK. [looks toward Craig] Craig,",Jan
Yeah. Here's the deal. I did not understand this was supposed to be a full on... like report or whatnot.,Craig
"Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?",Jan
"I was under the impression this was, more of like... a meet and greet type deal.",Craig
"So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch?",David
"That is correct, yes.",Craig
"Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?",Jan
"Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know.",Craig
"Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.",Jan
"Oh man, you know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesn't get into any trouble? Maybe I should have slept with you, too. [David looks at Jan, who glares at Michael.]",Craig
"Oh, ok. Alright.",Michael
"NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.",Jan
No you're not.,Michael
"Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.",Jan
"Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...",Michael
"Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?",Jan
Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.,Michael
"Surely, you cannot be serious?",Jan
I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.,Michael
"Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.",Dwight
Hey babe.,Roy
Hey.,Pam
You almost ready to go?,Roy
"I guess, yeah.",Pam
What's wrong?,Roy
"Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.",Pam
"What, you're mad at me?",Roy
"I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me",Pam
"Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life.",Roy
You understand this is a very serious situation.,David
"No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. [Jan looks at Michael]",Michael
You made a joke?,David
"I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins]",Michael
Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss...,David
"I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.",Michael
"Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it.",Jan
Good. [Michael leaves office],David
Heading out?,Pam
"Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day.",Jim
Bye. [Jim leaves],Pam
Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.],Phyllis
Night Phyllis.,Pam
"Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.",Jan
"Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.",Michael
"Oh, no, it's OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.",Jan
"Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day. [Jan turns and then kisses Michael. Michael looks and sees camera, Jan turns and sees camera, too. Elevator door closes.]",Michael
Oh.,Jan
Oy vey... schmear. [Points at Fiddler on the Roof playing at Minskoff Theatre and does a dance.],Michael
"Everybody, hello, can I have your attention, please? Since it's Valentine's Day, there's something that I wanted to say. I love the women of this office. Pam, I love you.",Michael
Michael's got a few tricks for Valentine's Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he's got a great line. 'Me so thorny.',Pam
"I love you, Angela. Yes, even you. I love you, Kelly. I love you, Meredith. This is all platonically, of course.",Michael
"I love ladies, always have. And you know what I think is the most attractive part of a woman's body? The brains. Because I don't think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart. And also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.",Michael
"You have any big Valentine's Day plans, Kev?",Pam
"Not really, my fiance is out of town.",Kevin
Where is she?,Pam
I'm not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn't tell me.,Kevin
Cool.,Pam
"That's a lot of noodles. How much sodium do you think is in that cup? This place used to be full of hookers and porn shops and it's not that way anymore. There's an old building. That one hasn't been torn down yet, but they will. They'll get to it.",Michael
"Happy Valentine's Day, Meredith.",Oscar
Thanks.,Meredith
"Okay, you take it easy, ace.",Creed
"Here you go, Creed.",Oscar
"Hey, thanks, ace.",Creed
I'm not good with names.,Creed
"This is where it's all happening. We got TGI Fridays. I'm in the picture! Sometimes I just jump into people's pictures. Lot of people have their picture taken. It's kind of a New Yorker thing. You jump in on a tourist's picture and kind of ruin it. There's an energy to New York that you just feel. Um, everybody... Don't get hit. Everybody is kind of together and everybody hates each other, but loves each other at the same time. Screw off! People just yell at each other in New York, and it's great.",Michael
I'm gonna go call Bob.,Phyllis
"So, what are you doing for Valentine's Day?",Vance Refrigeration Worker #1
I'm gonna spend it with my fiance.,Pam
Okay.,Vance Refrigeration Worker #1
What are you guys doing?,Pam
Probably go grab dinner with my girlfriend. He's gonna be pulling his pud watching Skinemax. [points to Vance Refrigeration Worker #2],Vance Refrigeration Worker #1
Nice.,Pam
"Okay, okay. That's enough.",Dwight
Hey.,Phyllis
"Come on, break this up.",Dwight
"Yes, sure. Mr. Scott, you can head to the conference room. The other managers are already there.",Receptionist
Great. Thank you.,Michael
All right.,Receptionist
"Okay, here's the thing about Jan. She talks such a big game about, 'Oh there's nothing between us and stop talking about it.' And 'Border-line harassment when you call me at home.' But let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on Valentine's Day? Answer, maybe, but maybe not. We shall see.",Michael
How do you spell 'animalian'?,Dwight
Animalian?,Jim
Yes.,Dwight
Why?,Jim
None of your business. I'm writing something.,Dwight
You're writing something?,Jim
Forget it. I'll look it up myself.,Dwight
Okay.,Jim
"No, you know what? You do it.",Dwight
"No, I'm not gonna do that.",Jim
"Uh, yes, I'm in charge. You have to. Look it up.",Dwight
But I know how to spell it.,Jim
So tell me.,Dwight
Only if you tell me what you're writing.,Jim
Forget it. I'll do it. But you're getting written up.,Dwight
So now you're writing two things?,Jim
"Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so... I guess there really is someone for everybody.",Jim
"[phone ringing] Hi, this is Kevin. Stacy? Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah. Oh, awesome. Okay. Yeah, I'll be leaving here soon. Cool. I love you, too. Okay, 'bye. Stacy's back.",Kevin
"That's great, man.",Oscar
Hey Scott. Hey. Hey! Hey! Come here! Come here! I want to talk to you. Come here!,Devon
You know what? It was nice to see Devon again. To sort of get closure on that whole thing.,Michael
Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...,Michael
They are either going to say yes... or no.,Dwight
Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.,Michael
Think it through.,Dwight
Have to think it through. Because if they say no...,Michael
Can we not?,Jim
"No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. [Michael starts playing with a football in the office] Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! [laughs] Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.",Michael
Still want that.,Jim
"Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.",Michael
Ryan!,Creed
Fumble! Yaaah!,Dwight
"Hey, Dwight.",Michael
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!,Dwight
You all right Ryan?,Michael
Ryan.,Dwight
Yeah.,Ryan
Pam!,Michael
"Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?",Dwight
Cugino's pizza.,Jim
"Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs?",Dwight
"Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...",Jim
What did I do to deserve this?,Jim
Are you sad that Dwight beat you?,Pam
No.,Jim
"Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?",Pam
"Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?",Phyllis
Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later.,Pam
Oh.,Phyllis
"Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.",Jim
"Ok, cool.",Pam
I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.,Pam
That's what she said!,Michael
Ha! I don't get it.,Dwight
Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?,Michael
"Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?",Dwight
"Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.",Michael
"Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.",Michael
"What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...'",Dwight
That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.,Michael
"When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.",Dwight
I can't do this.,Dwight
"That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.",Michael
"Oh, okay.",Dwight
But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.,Michael
"Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.",Dwight
"Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.",Michael
I'll try and think of one. When...,Dwight
Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.,Michael
Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?,Dwight
Insult.,Michael
"Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my...",Pam
"Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?",Jim
I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.,Jim
Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...,Jim
"I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.",Oscar
"[stand up comic voice] But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?",Michael
Saleswoman has a vagina.,Dwight
"It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a Sex Ed class.",Michael
But I'm right?,Dwight
"Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? [stand up comic voice] The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!",Michael
Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?,Dwight
I do. Both of them.,Michael
Could I have a copy of one of them?,Dwight
"No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.",Michael
Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!,Michael
Yeah!,Dwight
[generalized clapping and cheering] Congratulations.,Michael
Unbelievable.,Phyllis
"You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.",Michael
That is so great about the bonus!,Dwight
"No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience.",Michael
Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she...,Stanley
It's unbelievable!,Phyllis
Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.,Dwight
Do we know anyone who was in the accident?,Pam
Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.,Dwight
Why would this affect our bonuses?,Stanley
They are unrelated.,Dwight
Is Brad okay?,Kelly
"He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.",Dwight
What the hell is going on here?,Oscar
Are we out of jobs?,Angela
Yes.,Dwight
This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.,Kelly
He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.,Michael
Michael?,Stanley
Yeah.,Michael
You said we were getting bonuses.,Stanley
All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.,Michael
Cancel wallpaper.,Stanley
"As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice. [speaking to camera] You saw the plaque, right? [to office] All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.",Michael
You mean Toastmasters?,Pam
"Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.",Michael
"Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?",Pam
Can I go?,Jim
Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.,Michael
So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?,Jim
You should go to Hedonism.,Kevin
What is that?,Jim
"It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.",Kevin
"I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.",Jim
Been to Amsterdam.,Toby
Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.,Michael
[mimes lifting a glass] To Amsterdam.,Toby
When did you go there?,Jim
Umm... After my divorce. Yeah.,Toby
Really for like how long?,Jim
"Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh can't...",Toby
"Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me.",Creed
Where do I want to go?,Jim
I'd send you to Hong Kong.,Creed
Like to say 'Hi' to my friends in China. [speaks in Chinese],Creed
"Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.",Michael
"Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.",Dwight
No. We're not.,Jim
"Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.",Dwight
Which means absolutely nothing.,Jim
"Michael, can you explain?",Dwight
"Well, it's mostly made up. So...",Michael
Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.,Michael
"Confidence, Dwight.",Michael
Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?,Jim
I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.,Dwight
Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.,Jim
Oh please! You're not taking any trip.,Dwight
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.,Jim
You did?,Dwight
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.,Jim
Yes. I am.,Dwight
"The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.",Jim
Which is?,Dwight
You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.,Jim
"Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini.",Jim
"Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own",Jim
I'll glance at it.,Dwight
"It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.",Michael
"The very best of luck to you, Dwight.",Angela
"Thank you, Angela.",Dwight
Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception?,Kelly
Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think.,Pam
You're inviting Jim?,Ryan
Of course. He's one of my closest friends.,Pam
All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We're down here. Right.,Michael
[song] You all ready for this?,Overhead
[coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.,Angela
"I've never, ever seen you take a sick day.",Kevin
"Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us.",Angela
"Next, I'd like to introduce the Dunder Mifflin Salesman of the Year, Dwight Schrute!",Speaker
[polite clapping],Crowd
"Dwight, they called your name.",Michael
"Dwight, how we doing?",Speaker
"No, I can't... I ca...",Dwight
All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you. [shouts] All right!,Michael
[claps],Crowd
"Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?",Michael
I always set it at 69. [snickers],Kevin
Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.,Pam
"But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding. I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?",Kelly
"Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.",Ryan
Oh.,Kelly
"Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just...",Pam
I know what I said.,Ryan
"I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot. [makes robot sounds] Michael Winslow, anyone?",Michael
"Car starting. [makes car sounds] All right, Dwight Schrute everyone.",Michael
[clapping],Crowd
Good luck. That is a tough crowd.,Michael
"[bangs fists] Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. [waves arm] how long we have been striving for greatness? [bangs fist] Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle [waves arms]. A never-ending fight. I say to you [hits podium] and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!",Dwight
[clapping],Crowd
WE ARE WARRIORS!,Dwight
[clapping and cheering],Crowd
"Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!",Dwight
[clapping and cheering],Crowd
[laughs maniacally] Yeah. Yes!,Dwight
I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.,Oscar
Maybe. Thanks.,Jim
You really think you're going to go?,Ryan
Yeah. I'm definitely going.,Jim
Nice. Send me a postcard.,Ryan
"Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.",Ryan
No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. [bangs fists],Dwight
[claps],Crowd
"Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL! We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is...",Dwight
[shouts] Together that we prevail! [cheering and clapping],Crowd
Australia? I have always wanted to go there?,Pam
"I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.",Jim
That's awesome. Where are you staying?,Pam
I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...,Jim
When are you leaving?,Pam
I'm... leaving on June 8th.,Jim
Oh.,Pam
"Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just...",Jim
Oh yeah. That's too bad.,Pam
Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?,Jim
It's ok. I got it.,Pam
Alright.,Jim
"Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened?",Dwight
I got thirsty. How'd it go?,Michael
It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.,Dwight
You would not believe what happened here.,Michael
What? Something happened?,Dwight
"Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.",Michael
Weird.,Dwight
"Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'",Michael
Con artist.,Dwight
She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?,Michael
"Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?",Michael
"My future is so bright, Jim. Jim, do you know how bright my future is? It's so bright that... What? Do you know? Is there something I got to wear? Huh?",Dwight
Goggles?,Jim
[imitating '80s rock],Dwight
"And what a lot of people don't understand about sales is that it has so much to do with organization. I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to, when I speak to them and what we have discussed. Etcetera.",Dwight
"That's it? You're going to end with 'etcetera'? Okay, what's this big organizational system that...",Michael
"Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?",Dwight
"That would be suicide. Never, never talk specifics. Not in a speech. But the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.",Michael
It is?,Dwight
It's your delivery...,Michael
What is?,Dwight
Our biggest worry.,Michael
I don't follow.,Dwight
"My God, Dwight. The best way to learn is by watching. That's why porn is a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Listen. Okay. Sit down, let me wow you. [clears throat] [shouting]",Michael
"Oh, God!",Dwight
"See, I have your attention now, don't I? You're scared, but now you're ready to learn.",Michael
"Well, that didn't go well.",Dwight
"No, it did not. And that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor. We'll find you a joke that not even you can ruin.",Michael
"All right, listen up, please. Dwight has a joke.",Michael
[whispering to Angela] Stop it. [to the office] Two sailors walk into a bar...,Dwight
Please don't tell a sailor joke.,Meredith
"Oh, why not?",Dwight
Her nephew's in Iraq.,Phyllis
Iraq is sand. Sailors are on water.,Michael
"Yes, but they are both in danger.",Pam
"Yeah, well, you know what? We need to... All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let's go.",Michael
Who's gonna start. How about Phyllis? You kick us off and then we'll move around. Go ahead.,Michael
What are we supposed to talk about?,Phyllis
Anything your heart desires.,Michael
I would like to toast to the good fortune I've been having lately...,Phyllis
[shouting] Louder!,Michael
"I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...",Phyllis
"Good. Good, good, good. That's good. Now see, that's not so hard, right? All right. Who's next? Who are we going to... Ryan. Ryan's next.",Michael
Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?,Ryan
"Don't be shy, shy boy. Don't be shy. Get up there.",Michael
"Well... A lot of you know that I'm in business school. And while I'm learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I'll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else.",Ryan
All right.,Dwight
"Way to go, Ryan!",Stanley
"Stop! Stop! Stop! That's, you know what? The toast is really not supposed to be about anything. It's certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so...",Michael
"Ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time. Am I worried about that? Try scared to death.",Michael
I got the stamps.,Ryan
The ones that say 'love' on them?,Pam
The ones that say '39 cents.',Ryan
Oh. Doesn't matter.,Pam
I didn't think it did.,Ryan
"As soon as they leave, well get Kelly and start.",Pam
Kelly's helping?,Ryan
Is that okay?,Pam
"Yeah, sure.",Ryan
"Ghosts. Lots of ghosts in this old Radisson. There it is, Rosebud Room. Memories. Wow, this turnout is pathetic. I packed the house, you know.",Michael
"Oh, no, I don't think this is it.",Dwight
"Numismatic. Numismatic Collectors. Nope, wrong room.",Michael
"Okay. They got sports medicine seminar, nope. Science fiction convention, nope.",Michael
"Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I'm so in love with her.",Dwight
You're weird.,Michael
"No, no, no. It's totally normal, 'cause she's not a Cylon or anything. She's just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.",Dwight
Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don't know. There we go.,Michael
"Ah, look at me. I'm huge in Wilkes-Barre. Performing nightly, Michael Scott. Not comedy fans here, which is fine because not having a sense of humor is just as fine as having one. Questions? Comment? Can't see you, but I know that you're not breathing. I know you're breathing. Is this on? Hello? 'Well, isn't that... Well, isn't that special?' 'Jell-O pudding.' Bill Cosby. I think Bill Cosby said it best when he talked about his brother and all of the fun he... All the great things they did together as kids. And there was the one time when he put the snowball in the freezer, and it... And he waited for five months and then he took the snowball out and he threw it... He would have thrown it at the kid but then his mother had thrown out the snowball so he couldn't throw it. So... Bill Cosby is smoking! And now some race car. [imitating race car engine] That brings me to my... Brings me to a point that you should always have a list of your clients. It's important to because a client list is next to godliness... List. [baby crying] Could you shut him up, please? I mean, who brings a baby to a sales conference? Really rude.",Michael
"I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.",Pam
Bribery. Nice.,Jim
"Oh, I have more. [Holds up bags of candy]",Pam
Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---,Michael
"Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today. [whispering] 'Cause of the... [points to 'Welcome Daughters!' sign]",Pam
"... Oh, God is that today?",Michael
I reminded you last night.,Pam
"Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in 'Raw,' and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in 'Daddy Daycare.' both great movies, but, still.",Michael
"Well, I'll be in my office.",Michael
Don't you think you should say something?,Pam
They're cool.,Michael
"Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---",Pam
"Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.",Michael
[in unison] That's Batman.,Jim and Dwight
"Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?",Michael
The ocean.,Jim
[under his breath] I work with a bunch of nerds.,Michael
[looks at Sasha] Mmm... hello tiny one.,Dwight
[to Sasha] Come on.,Toby
You are the future!,Dwight
This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.,Kevin
"Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check.",Kevin
"Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa.",Stanley
"Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her.",Michael
I'm in eighth grade.,Melissa
Oh.,Michael
She's in middle school.,Stanley
"Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.",Michael
"It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.",Michael
[while Jake is throwing things at Michael] They want how many spiral pads?,Michael
"Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order.",Meredith
Okay.,Michael
"I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter.",Meredith
Can you put that down there?,Angela
Yep. [spreads tablecloth],Kelly
"[to Sasha] Okay, tell them what you wanted to say.",Toby
Do you need any help?,Sasha
"No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.",Angela
"Alright, I wasn't expecting that. Let's uh... let's go draw.",Toby
"Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela?",Kelly
"I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.",Angela
God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!,Kelly
"Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.",Ryan
"[on phone] Just compare last year's order to this year's. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. [Sasha walks in the door] ... Yes. We--yeah, they're very--they're different. [Sasha walks out] Yeah, we can stick with last year's, you're just going to have to supplement it, somehow.",Michael
"Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool.",Pam
No thanks.,Abby
I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.,Pam
What are you reading?,Jim
From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.,Abby
"Aww, best book?",Jim
"Yeah, but I've read it before.",Abby
"Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?",Jim
Definitely the Aquarium.,Abby
"Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.",Jim
Sure.,Abby
Really?,Jim
Mmhmm!,Abby
"Yesss. And you're Abby, right?",Jim
Yeah.,Abby
I'm Jim. [Jim hi-fives Abby] Annnnd... let's sell some paper.,Jim
Alright.,Abby
Let's start with... your mom.,Jim
"[on phone] Yes. Well... we can... [Sasha walks in, begins playing with Michael's toy train] uhm... hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise. ...Hello, can I help you? ... You can pick that up, if you want. That's--- that's alright. [Sasha moves the train to Michael's desk] Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name?",Michael
Sasha.,Sasha
Nice to meet you.,Michael
Ooh! [picks up train whistle],Sasha
"Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor. [blows into whistle] But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right? [blows into whistle] You want to try?",Michael
Sure. [Sasha blows into whistle continously],Sasha
"All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga! [Sasha and Michael laugh]",Michael
"[shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.",Jim
There is no way that hurt.,Dwight
"Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight.",Jim
"Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. [Abby shakes his hand] I don't feel anything. Nothing. [to Jim] You're so weak. [Jake walks over and messes with Dwight's bobbleheads] Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?",Dwight
Do you have any computer games?,Jake
"No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.",Dwight
"Yeah, Meredith doesn't have any either. It's so lame here.",Jake
You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.,Dwight
"Whatever, okay?",Jake
You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.,Dwight
That's your name? Mister Poop?,Jake
Schrute. Mister Schrute.,Dwight
"Sure, Mister Poop. [Jake walks away]",Jake
"[quietly] ... Schrute. [Jim and Abby snicker, Angela glares at Dwight]",Dwight
[to Phyllis] Are you Mother Goose?,Sasha
"I drink like, a hundred Ice Macchiatos a day, and practically nothing else.",Melissa
Wow.,Ryan
"There's a really cool coffee place, Jitters, at the Steamtown Mall. Ever been there?",Melissa
No.,Ryan
"You've never been to Jitters? Ryan, you are",Melissa
Uhm...,Ryan
Come on! [Kelly glares through the door] You have an email address?,Melissa
...that I thought you should know ...,Kelly
Mmhmm. What?,Stanley
I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa],Kelly
A little fishy?,Stanley
"Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ... [Stanley gets up]",Kelly
"That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?!",Stanley
"Yes, I--",Ryan
"Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!",Stanley
Okay.,Ryan
Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.,Ryan
"[plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid. This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!",Dwight
Dwight! Dwight!,Michael
There's a photo...,Dwight
What the hell are you reading to them?,Michael
"These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---",Dwight
"Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.",Michael
What's a Nazi?,Sasha
What's a Nazi?,Michael
[standing up] Nazi was a fascist movement...,Dwight
Don't!,Michael
...from the 1930's...,Dwight
"Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?",Michael
I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.,Dwight
[sighing] Why don't you just leave? Okay?,Michael
...Okay.,Dwight
"Bye, Mister Poop.",Jake
"Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?",Michael
"[raising hands] I do, I do!",The Kids
"Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. [cracks up]",Michael
"You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].",Angela
"This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these? [pets shelf of paper] You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?",Michael
So... you cut the paper and dye it and stuff.,Melissa
"No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.",Michael
That's not fair. [the rest of the kids agree],Abby
"Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...",Michael
You're just a middleman.,Jake
I'm not just a middle... man...,Michael
"Wait, why doesn't the saw mill just sell paper directly to people?",Melissa
"You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business.",Michael
We have better service than they do!,Dwight
"...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?",Michael
That is correct.,Creed
Say hi to the kids.,Michael
Hi kids.,Creed
Yaaaaay.,Michael
Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? [begins untying shoe],Creed
Ewwww!,Kids
"What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?",Michael
"Th-the hair covers it, mostly.",Creed
"No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?",Michael
"You know, there's something interesting about me you might want to know. I ... used to be ... the star of a kids show.",Michael
No way.,Kids
It's true. I did.,Michael
You serious?,Melissa
Really?,Jake
I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.,Michael
That doesn't sound like a show.,Abby
What?!,Melissa
"It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. [gets up and runs out] Ryan, can you come here a second? [clears throat] I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.",Michael
Right. Okay.,Ryan
I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?,Michael
"Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...",Ryan
"You know, I can go with him.",Melissa
Oka--,Michael
No! I will... go.,Ryan
"Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.",Michael
"[to Abby] Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?",Michael
"I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake.",Michael
"I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?",Michael
"[from TV] ...Bundle, are you ready to come on in? [TV children cheer] Let's have some fun!",Miss Trudy
"That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...",Michael
Is that a real fun shooting windmill?,Dwight
"Stop! Stop! Stop! [Ryan resumes the tape] Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow.",Michael
That's pretty funny.,Jim
Yeah.,Michael
"...Recess! Hey, what's your name?",Edward R. Meow
My name's Chet.,Chet
Well hi Chet.,Edward R. Meow
Is that Chet Montgomery?,Oscar
"Uhh, I don't know.",Michael
That is!,Pam
Checkin' in with Chet. Doppler's up.,Darryl
What do you want to be when you grow up?,Edward R. Meow
I want to be on TV!,Chet
[employees chuckle] And he,Dwight
"Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don't miss it.",Michael
"Okay, next? So, whats your name?",Edward R. Meow
Oh! That's me. Shh. Shh.,Michael
Well what's your favorite subject at school?,Edward R. Meow
Recess.,Young Michael
"Ree-cesss. So tell me, what do you want to be when you grow up?",Edward R. Meow
"I want to be married and have a hundred kids so I can have a hundred friends, and no one can say no to being my friend.",Young Michael
"[jaw drops, awkward pause] Uh, ah... oh, okay! Well uh, nice talking with you, Michael. Uh, back to you Miss Trudy!",Edward R. Meow
"Hi everyone, it's one of my favorite times of the day.",Miss Trudy
Coulda sworn there was...,Michael
Did you get married?,Melissa
"...uh, no.",Michael
Why not?,Abby
"Uh, just never happened.",Michael
"So, do you have any kids?",Sasha
"Uh, nope.",Michael
Do you have a girlfriend?,Jake
I do okay.,Michael
Was Chet Montgomery cool back then?,Melissa
Yes.,Michael
Even I have a girlfriend.,Jake
"Okay! Alright, okay.",Michael
So you didn't get to be what you wanted to be.,Sasha
"...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye.",Michael
He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.,Pam
"Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.",Jim
[wrestling with Jake] Pam! Pam! I love this guy! [laughs] Come on!,Roy
"So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. She's",Pam
Who? Terry?,Melissa
Mmhmm.,Pam
That woman is not my mother. That is my step-mother.,Melissa
"Mister Poop, I have to tell you something.",Jake
"Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name.",Dwight
You're ugly.,Jake
Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...,Dwight
Meredith!,Jake
[Toby knocks on door] Yeah?,Michael
I think these belong to you. [puts toys down on desk],Toby
"Oh, that's okay, she can keep those.",Michael
"Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch.",Toby
Thank you.,Michael
Is everything okay?,Toby
You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.,Michael
Uh... it's true...,Toby
"Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost.",Michael
Mmhmm.,Toby
"Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?",Michael
"Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.",Toby
What about...,Michael
Not Jan.,Toby
...Jan. Kay.,Michael
"If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something.",Toby
...Or biologically.,Michael
Somehow.,Toby
"Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I...",Michael
Yes.,Toby
Oh... kay.,Michael
Is it okay if I take one?,Jake
Sure.,Pam
Thank you.,Jake
You're welcome.,Pam
Is your job hard?,Jake
"It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?",Pam
Yeah!,Jake
Really?,Pam
Yeah.,Jake
Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. [shreds paper] Cool huh?,Pam
"That's so cool, yeah!",Jake
"Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.",Pam
That's so awesome!,Jake
I know.,Pam
"Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one [types]. Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.",Michael
Go ahead.,Kevin
Do you want to come over for dinner tonight?,Abby
"Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods]",Jim
What're you doing? You never have plans.,Kevin
"Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.",Jim
Niiice.,Kevin
"Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do.",Michael
[singing] You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by... [Dwight joins in] and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...,Michael
Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?,Jim
I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. [Jim leaves],Pam
[singing] ...did slowly go by... and feed... them on your dreams...,Michael and Dwight
"My theory is that... [Jim signals he's leaving, waves bye to Pam]",Pam
[singing] ...The one they picked... the one you'll know by... don't you ever ask them why... if I told you would cry... you never look at them and sigh... and know they love you...,Michael and Dwight
"And they do, your parents, love you very much.",Dwight
One more time. [singing] You...,Michael
"The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. [Laughs] They didn't eat the children.",Dwight
Okay. I think five plain and one veggie should be fine.,Angela
How about pepperoni?,Phyllis
No.,Angela
I like extra cheese.,Ryan
Absolutely not.,Angela
"I like extra cheese, too.",Pam
Fine. The first lesson we'll teach children will be about obesity.,Angela
Thank you.,Ryan
"I'm pretty excited about today. I baby-sit Toby's daughter Sasha sometimes. So, she's the coolest kid. She has seen me play with dolls, though, so I don't know how cool she thinks I am.",Jim
Put that away and learn.,Stanley
Learn what?,Melissa
Learn why Daddy's so cranky when he comes home from work.,Stanley
I brought my daughter Melissa in. That girl is very spoiled. That child has no idea what I have to deal with so she can have her little cell phone and spend all my money at that Steamtown Mall.,Stanley
I'm gonna go read my book now.,Abby
[whispering] Angela. Is it okay if I'm the head accountant today?,Kevin
I'm the head accountant.,Angela
"Yeah, but can I say that I'm it, just for today?",Kevin
I can't set that kind of precedent. She's a bright girl. She'd see right through that.,Angela
"You must be pretty strong, huh?",Darryl
Yeah.,Jake
You think you can beat up Darryl?,Roy
"Yeah. I don't know, maybe.",Jake
I think you might be able to.,Roy
You think you could beat me up?,Darryl
"Yeah. Yeah, I do.",Jake
"Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let's see.",Darryl
I got some muscles. You wanna see the muscles? Bam! Look at that.,Jake
"Hey, don't touch him, please!",Michael
"Man, you have got to be kidding me.",Darryl
"Didn't do background checks of the warehouse guys. [exclaims] Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.",Michael
Can I have a quarter? I promise I'll pay you back.,Jake
Sure.,Michael
Can I have a dollar? Then I can buy chips and a drink.,Jake
Okay. There you go.,Michael
Will you marry my mom?,Jake
Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something.,Oscar
"Just give me two seconds, I'll be done.",Melissa
I was in the middle of something.,Oscar
"Dude, seriously, just give me two seconds, I'll be done.",Melissa
Stanley.,Oscar
"...get you, I'm gonna get you! Come back here for more! [squealing]",Abby
"Kids, kids, kids, slow down.",Creed
"Oh, I'm gonna get you!",Abby
"What the... [pulls a pencil eraser out of his mug, after a drink]",Dwight
Did you draw that?,Abby
"Yeah. Do you like to draw, Abby?",Pam
"Yeah, I wanna be an artist when I grow up.",Abby
"Me, too.",Pam
You are grown up.,Abby
"So, how's your day been?",Kelly
Okay. It's been a little more tiring than I thought.,Pam
"Yeah, it doesn't help that Stanley's daughter's such a slut.",Kelly
Hmm.,Pam
"Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official.",Jim
Thank you so much.,Abby
Absolutely.,Jim
"Oh, I hate to break it to you, Abby. The certificate's a fake. Okay? It's not real. Where's the certification number, Halpert?",Dwight
"Actually, I have the certification number right here.",Jim
"Oh, really? Uh-huh.",Dwight
Yup.,Jim
Oh. Okay. Fine. Well done.,Dwight
All right.,Jim
"A7557962.' Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do.",Jim
"So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.",Michael
Who is this guy again?,Oscar
Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.,Michael
Who uses calling cards anymore?,Ryan
"You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.",Michael
This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.,Oscar
Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!,Michael
"Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?",Toby
"You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. [Jim and Dwight raise their hands] Alright.",Michael
"No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?",Jim
"Alright, let me explain. Again. [draws on board] Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's... [Jim draws a triangle around Michael's diagram] ... I have to go make a call.",Michael
Happy birthday Michael.,Pam
Oh ho ho! What?,Michael
I said happy birthday.,Pam
Thank you! That's really nice.,Michael
"Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a",Michael
What's up?,Michael
"Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday.",Jim
"Ah, thank you sir.",Michael
Did you hear anything yet?,Meredith
No. I'm still waiting.,Kevin
[Dwight knocks on door] Yeah.,Michael
"Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!",Dwight
"Ohh, god.",Michael
Birthday hug!,Dwight
"No no no, no, new suit, please.",Michael
That suit is amazing.,Dwight
"Thank you very much. It is from Italy. [checks jacket] Actually--- no, Bulgaria.",Michael
Mmm. Maybe I should get one.,Dwight
Good luck. One of a kind.,Michael
Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?,Dwight
"Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it. They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.",Michael
"Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...",Dwight
"Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.",Michael
Let's get the party started. [Begins 'raising the roof'],Dwight
Let's get the party started. Not the way I taught you! [Michael joins in],Michael
"When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?",Phyllis
One's good.,Pam
"One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you?",Angela
"Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.",Dwight
Where do we get those?,Phyllis
Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam],Dwight
Michael wants a strippergram?,Pam
"Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom.",Dwight
No. This is a closed door meeting.,Angela
[answering phone] Yeah?,Michael
"Michael, I have Jan on the line.",Pam
"Oh, great, put her through.",Michael
"Hello, Michael.",Jan
"Hey, you.",Michael
"I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent.",Jan
"It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.",Michael
"Well, today's not my birthday, so...",Jan
"Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.",Michael
"...Happy birthday, Michael.",Jan
Thanks. [grins],Michael
Am I on camera?,Jan
Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. [Jan hangs up],Michael
"[to Ryan, sitting across from Michael] ...You can take a five, if you want.",Michael
Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!,Michael
"Mmhmm, happy birthday.",Stanley
Thanks.,Michael
"Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?",Jim
They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.,Kevin
"Oh, okay.",Jim
Second opinion on what?,Kelly
"Um, I might have skin cancer.",Kevin
"Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and",Kelly
"Kelly, you know what...",Jim
I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's.,Kelly
Who brought in donuts?,Toby
Somebody got donuts for my birthday!,Michael
Happy birthday!,Toby
You didn't know it was my birthday.,Michael
I... guess I forgot.,Toby
"Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut [closes box].",Michael
Are you serious?,Toby
Mmm.,Michael
Skin cancer is treatable.,Oscar
Right.,Kevin
It's going to be okay.,Oscar
"You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though.",Angela
"Hi, delivery for Michael Scott.",Delivery Woman
"Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great! [giggles] Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink! [puts single into delivery woman's pocket, giggles] Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright?",Michael
Uh... s-sure.,Delivery Woman
[laughing] Okay. I'm so nervous.,Michael
I can sign for it.,Pam
Oh. Thanks.,Delivery Woman
"When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.",Michael
[eating donuts while Dwight plays the recorder] Stop it. Stop! What is that?,Michael
"It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.",Dwight
"Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.",Michael
I probably care more than she does.,Dwight
You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this [points to James Dean poster].,Michael
When does he hear?,Pam
Sometime today.,Jim
Ohh... poor Kevin.,Pam
"If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.",Pam
"Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents. Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back... order... [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here! Come here!",Dwight
What?,Michael
"Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.",Dwight
"[grinning] Ohhh, God.",Michael
There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.,Dwight
"Ohhh, no.",Michael
So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!,Dwight
...I'll do it.,Oscar
"Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this.",Michael
Creed! Come on. Stanley!,Dwight
...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?,Pam
"Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...",Jim
"On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?",Dwight
Okay.,Michael
"Happy birth moment, Michael.",Dwight
Thank you.,Michael
One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling],Dwight
Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.,Michael
Oscar...,Dwight
It wasn't me.,Oscar
"Okay, that is",Dwight
"Uh, we don't make an eight foot sub. This is eight one foot subs.",Delivery Boy
"F. Alright, what's the damage?",Dwight
"Uh, thirty-nine sixty.",Delivery Boy
[pulls out wallet] Thirty nine... sixty.,Dwight
"Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.",Dwight
Here they come.,Dwight
Get in here... everybody.,Michael
Come and get it!,Dwight
Birthday party subs! My gift to you.,Michael
What is this?,Oscar
"Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.",Dwight
The best.,Michael
These are all the same?,Stanley
Yes.,Michael
Bologna? I don't eat bologna.,Angela
"Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.",Michael
No.,Angela
"Just the bread, it's fresh baked.",Michael
No.,Angela
Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.,Michael
"When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So...",Michael
"So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.",Jim
Sixty-nine cup of noodles.,Pam
"Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.",Jim
And his favorite lunch.,Pam
"Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer].",Dwight
[making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?,Ryan
"Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.",Dwight
[grabs cake] Oh. Thank you.,Angela
Oh. I got it.,Dwight
What are--- it's... the party planning committee.,Angela
[whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.,Dwight
Fine.,Angela
What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?,Dwight
Yes... [whispering] but don't expect any cookie.,Angela
[whispering] But what if i'm hungry?,Dwight
[whispering],Angela
[puts fabric softener into cart] ...What?,Jim
You use fabric softener?,Pam
"Yeah, you don't?",Jim
"No, I do.",Pam
...Okay.,Jim
"[singing] Happy birthday dear Michael, [Michael joins in, Kevin's phone rings] Happy birthday... [everyone but Dwight stops] ...tooo youuuu.",Office Staff
Hello? Hey.,Kevin
Kevin? Respect the birthday please.,Michael
"No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.",Kevin
Are you done? ...Good. Okay.,Michael
Here we go. Make a wish.,Dwight
Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... [blows out the candles],Michael
Yaoo yay! [claps],Dwight
... I asked for trick candles.,Michael
Pam was supposed to get 'em.,Dwight
"Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day.",Michael
No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.,Angela
"... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us [takes cake into office and slams the door].",Michael
[checking watch] We should probably head back.,Pam
Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.,Jim
You dare me? How old are you?,Pam
Just... quit stalling.,Jim
"[over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.",Pam
Such a dork.,Jim
"[loudspeaker] Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you...",Pam
Ma'am? Please don't touch that. That is not a toy.,Store Employee
Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry.,Pam
How old are you?,Jim
I hate you.,Pam
"[to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible.",Toby
There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.,Michael
Still scary.,Kevin
"Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.",Michael
Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.,Kevin
And laughter... also.,Michael
I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.,Toby
Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.,Michael
I work here.,Toby
"[mocking voice] Nyeh, I work here. [to Kevin] Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.",Michael
"If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.",Kevin
"Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.",Michael
"Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.",Dwight
"Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.",Jim
"Please, don't.",Dwight
You... owe me.,Jim
"Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.",Michael
Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?,Stanley
How dare you sir. You are gross.,Michael
[sees 'Happy Birthday Michael Scott!' poster at skating rink] That should not be there.,Michael
I'll get someone to take it down.,Dwight
"No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!",Michael
Don't be scared! You're good! You're good!,Kelly
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.,Ryan
Think you can let go?,Jim
No. [laughs],Pam
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by],Jim
YEAH!,Dwight
Who is that?,Pam
Is that Michael?,Jim
"Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.",Michael
I got it.,Pam
"Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.",Michael
...It's something to think about.,Jim
"I can't relax about it, you know?",Kevin
Kevin. You heard anything yet?,Michael
"No, not yet.",Kevin
Okay. Well. Live strong.,Michael
"Okay, Michael.",Kevin
Alright.,Michael
Michael?,Carol
"Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...",Michael
"Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson.",Carol
"Oh, these... all your kids?",Michael
No just the front two.,Carol
"Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?",Michael
Sure.,Carol
Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!,Michael
Push. Good! That's great. You got it. [Kevin's phone rings] Excuse me.,Michael
"Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.",Kevin
"Oh... God... [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here [hugs Kevin].",Michael
"Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.",Michael
"This is awesome. Thanks, you guys.",Kevin
"Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!",Michael
Turn it around. Turn it around.,Dwight
Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.,Michael
Number one!!,Dwight
Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.,Michael
Michael?,Pam
Yeah.,Michael
This is from all of us.,Pam
Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.,Michael
Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day.,Pam
"Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited, and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. Then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done.",Jim
Let's get the party started.,Dwight
"That's not how I taught you, right? [singing] My hump, my hump, my lovely lady lump Check it out [Dwight imitating drumbeat]",Michael
"Michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited. But he's also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he's ready to explode. As his right-hand man, it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.",Dwight
"Okay, here's the thing about bosses and employees. A good boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate me.' A great boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate yourselves, because you are the ones who made me great, and I will acknowledge your contributions with donuts.'",Michael
"Good. You know, Ryan, you didn't have to get me a present.",Michael
I won't.,Ryan
Good. Great.,Michael
"Okay, good. I think I'm gonna go.",Ryan
"No, I think you're gonna stay.",Michael
"On my 20th birthday, my supposed best friend, Sam Ambrose, ditched me for his twin sister's Sweet Sixteen party. And that was my worst birthday. Until today.",Michael
Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away],Kevin
"To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all.",Dwight
[knock on door] Mmm-hmm.,Michael
Hey. I got the information.,Ryan
"Oh, good. Okay. Don't tell me, tell them.",Michael
[turns to camera] 'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.',Ryan
"Oh, my God. That's a piece of cake. That's a piece of cake. Oh, 2%. Jeez, that's good.",Michael
"[looking at camera] 'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.'",Ryan
"Out of, like, 18 billion Americans, so, no worry.",Michael
"For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...'",Ryan
"Those were probably misdiagnosed. I mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, 'I have cancer.'",Michael
The skin is the largest organ of the body.',Ryan
"Untrue. The heart is bigger than the skin. If you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body.",Michael
"I'm not afraid of dying. I know where I'm going. But if I were Kevin, I might be terrified. Gluttony.",Angela
"Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. [Kevin shoves the rest of the donut he's eating into his mouth] Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.",Dwight
"You look cute today, Dwight.",Jim
"Thanks, girl.",Dwight
"So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight",Jim
"Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we? You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.",Dwight
[nods] Hey...,Kevin
"I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions. But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't.",Dwight
[mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.,Jim
"[laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that's supposed to be Phyllis. I can't do it as good as he can.",Pam
"And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said 'Is it okay if I sip it?' and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.",Kelly
"Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour. Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister! My ass is is on the line! Now I'm going to ask you again. What time did you go home last night?",Dwight
Six.,Kelly
I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.,Dwight
I go to a lot of parties.,Ryan
"Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car. Give me you keys.",Dwight
I am not giving you my keys.,Ryan
Don't make me do this the hard way.,Dwight
What's the hard way?,Ryan
"I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.",Dwight
"Yeah, let's do it that way.",Ryan
"Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.",Michael
I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.,Dwight
Whoa. You are a volunteer.,Jim
I volunteered for this job.,Dwight
And that's not the same.,Jim
It is my duty...,Dwight
[interrupting] Volunteer duty.,Jim
...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.,Dwight
[fake coughing] Narc!,Michael
[giggling],Kevin
If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.,Dwight
I wasn't attempting to compliment you.,Michael
"Well, you have...",Dwight
"Uuf, well...",Michael
...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...,Dwight
[shakes head] Okay...,Michael
...and I am very proud of being a narc.,Dwight
"Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! [to Jim] Dude, where's my office? [Jim quietly laughs] I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!",Michael
"Well, your office is behind you.",Jim
Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?,Michael
I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.,Ryan
Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.,Dwight
Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?,Dwight
"No, I have not.",Oscar
Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?,Dwight
What are you implying?,Oscar
Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?,Dwight
Okay. I'm done with this.,Oscar
He sure left in a hurry.,Dwight
I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.,Dwight
Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her],Dwight
"Yes, it's marijuana.",Phyllis
How do you know that?,Dwight
It's labeled.,Phyllis
[grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.,Dwight
That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica.,Creed
"No, it's marijuana.",Dwight
I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.,Jim
"That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me.",Dwight
"Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.",Jim
I would remember.,Dwight
"Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?",Jim
That's not how it works.,Dwight
Now how do you know how it works?,Jim
"Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you.",Dwight
No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?,Jim
[opens eyes wide in total surprise],Dwight
"So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.",Oscar
"Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me? [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]",Jim
Is that supposed to be me?,Stanley
"Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.",Jim
I do not think that is funny.,Stanley
He does everyone in the office.,Pam
Hmmmpt.,Stanley
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.,Pam/Jim
Jinx! Buy me a coke.,Pam
Oh...,Jim
"No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke. Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid. [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out]",Pam
Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.,Pam
[mouths] C'mon!,Jim
"Sorry, that's not my problem.",Pam
"[presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]",Jim
"I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.",Dwight
I understand.,Angela
Where were you yesterday after work?,Dwight
[smiles knowingly],Angela
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out. Narc! Narc! Kevin?,Michael
"That is so good, Michael",Kevin
"Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who's in trouble?",Michael
Attention everyone. Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.,Dwight
Waa... what? What are you talking about?,Michael
Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.,Dwight
"Is that true, Toby?",Oscar
"Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.",Toby
"Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.",Michael
"Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.",Michael
No you can't do that.,Dwight
"I can do that, it is my office.",Michael
"No you cannot. It has to be official, and it",Dwight
Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great.,Michael
"Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?",Dwight
I'm not taking Rogaine.,Kevin
"Angela, what about you?",Dwight
I don't take any prescription drugs.,Angela
You're not on,Dwight
[Gives Dwight a knowing look],Angela
Good.,Dwight
"So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I'm not that kind of...",Kelly
"Hey guys, what's going on?",Pam
"We're having the best conversation. [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]",Kelly
"Oh, okay. Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, 'Gee, thanks, Pam.']",Pam
"So, I was looking so hot...",Kelly
It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.,Michael
We don't feel that way.,Phyllis
"No, not at all.",Angela
You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.,Oscar
"No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, 'Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.'",Michael
"Thank you, Michael.",Dwight
"I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.",Michael
"Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.",Michael
Where did you get these facts?,Stanley
"Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?",Michael
They are not.,Stanley
Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?,Michael
"No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week. For the antioxidants.",Stanley
"Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?",Michael
"Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael.",Toby
Yes it is.,Michael
"No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.",Toby
"Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.",Michael
You can't do that.,Toby
"I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.",Michael
That's not random.,Toby
"Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam.",Michael
I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.,Pam
Really? [Jim shakes his head no],Michael
"Uh, hmmm.",Pam
"Jim it's okay. You can t... [Jim looks at Pam and shakes his head, Pam looks at him and gestures for Jim to go up and tell his story] This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he's doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It's okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths 'I can't' and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well.",Michael
Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.,Pam
"The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.",Michael
"No, you will be tested.",Dwight
"Yes, I will not be.",Michael
You will be. That is the law according to the rules.,Dwight
"Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.",Michael
"Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.",Dwight
We test a lot of urine.,Linda
Mine was green.,Dwight
"Oh, right. How are you?",Linda
I'm all better.,Dwight
So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.,Michael
What kind of filing?,Dwight
Just forget it. Just the urine.,Michael
That goes directly to the tester.,Dwight
Just. I need your urine.,Michael
Like in a cup?,Dwight
"Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.",Michael
For what purpose?,Dwight
It's none of your business.,Michael
Then I refuse.,Dwight
"Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.",Michael
Are you serious?,Dwight
I need clean urine for the lady.,Michael
But that's illegal.,Dwight
"Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes",Michael
Not my urine.,Dwight
A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.,Michael
Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?,Dwight
"No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.",Michael
Do you want to give Michael your urine?,Angela
I want him to have all the urine he needs.,Dwight
You're not going to get my permission on this.,Angela
I know that. Don't you think I know that?,Dwight
"Yeah, we do testing all over the country.",Linda
"Cool. Hey, are you guys hiring?",Ryan
You want to work at the urinalysis lab?,Linda
Yeah. Maybe.,Ryan
"My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.",Dwight
"What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means]",Pam
I'd like a magazine.,Kevin
"We just need urine, sir.",Linda
I'd still like one.,Kevin
"Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.",Michael
That's great.,Dwight
What's wrong? Where's your costume?,Michael
It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.,Dwight
Why? Wha...,Michael
I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.,Dwight
[placing a coke can in front of Jim] Here. [Jim looks confused] Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. [Pam scoots the coke can towards Jim. Jim pulls out his wallet and hands Pam a dollar. He gives the coke back to Pam],Pam
Hi.,Jim
Hey.,Pam
How much time do you have left on your break?,Jim
Ten minutes.,Pam
"Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.",Michael
Really?,Dwight
"Yes, sir.",Michael
That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .,Dwight
So you wanna? Thanks.,Michael
"Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary voluntary corporal in charge of assisting all activities security.",Hank
Okay.,Michael
Here's your badge.,Hank
"Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank] Can I have a gun?",Dwight
"No, I don't have a gun.",Hank
"Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.",Dwight
I don't think so.,Hank
Good.,Michael
"[salutes] Thank you, Michael.",Dwight
No. Oh. Uh...[awkwardly salutes],Michael
I need to go over some details with you.,Dwight
"Alright. [to Hank] Well, Thank you.",Michael
"First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?",Dwight
Two.,Hank
"Oh, God.",Dwight
Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk. Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael? I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?,Jim
[growling] Nice.,Jim
Kevin.,Pam
Yeah.,Jim
Do someone else.,Pam
"Um, [gives Pam a look]",Jim
Angela.,Pam
Whoa.,Jim
The eyebrow.,Pam
Yeah.,Jim
"I'm not only hoping to find the culprit who committed this heinous crime, I am praying to find this heinous culprit. And I will pray to Thor himself, if that's what it takes.",Dwight
"Michael's behavior is erratic and unpredictable, but I don't think he's doing drugs. Maybe he should. Take the edge off. Uh, not at work, of course.",Toby
"People use marijuana to escape. Jim does not have a girlfriend. His sales are nothing to brag about. And he does not belong to any organized clubs. If that were my life, I'd do drugs.",Dwight
He asked if you've been acting withdrawn lately.,Phyllis
And what did you say?,Stanley
I said no.,Phyllis
Hmm.,Stanley
You're welcome.,Phyllis
"Your turn, Stanley. [Stanley just takes a drink from his mug] Angela, you're up.",Dwight
Last night? Let's see.,Pam
Go ahead. Don't lie.,Dwight
I won't. It's just that last night is really hard for me to remember because I was just a teensy bit high. Should I have not said that?,Pam
"No, no, no. It's okay. Go ahead.",Dwight
I know that I shouldn't have done it. But I was in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy.,Pam
Oh.,Dwight
And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.,Pam
Oh.,Dwight
Pam said you had something important to tell me. Is it bad? Am I getting fired? [Jim shakes head 'no'] Why aren't you telling me? It must be bad. They're taking away my kid. I knew it. [Jim waves arms and shakes head 'no'] They're not taking away my kid. Oh.,Meredith
"Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold.",Kelly
"Kelly Kapour. Say your prayers. Let's go. Conference room, pronto. Come on, step it up.",Dwight
"Drugs are everywhere in our society. They are omniscient. If you look at the amount of pot that was smoked in the United States last year, that would reach the moon.",Michael
How?,Oscar
Exactly. I know. It's amazing.,Michael
"No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...",Oscar
"I have some hemp ropes at my house, they're really strong...",Creed
Shut... Shut it. No. Just... Just focus on the facts. Cocaine. They use cocaine.,Michael
"Oh, me? Just one of the gang. Sitting in the back, doodling, not playing attention. Bam! Pow! Surprise! Got you! [Note pad reads, 'Creed -Shifty eyes / Ryan - Dilated pupils / Kelly - Hyperactive'] There's a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy in your midst, and he is taking names.",Dwight
"One thing that you need to remember is that there's no way of knowing who's a user, who's an abuser, because we don't know. It could be anybody. Your instinct is to say it's somebody-like Stanley or Oscar...",Michael
Excuse me?,Stanley
"No, no! Your instinct. That... Your gut reaction is to say that, but I don't! That's, that's... Those are instincts that have been created by media and hype. And they are wrong. What I am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are. It may be the person you least suspect. It may be somebody hot, like Pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like Phyllis, but just not me.",Michael
"It's not me, either.",Phyllis
"No? okay, fine.",Michael
"[on the phone] Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting.",Jan
"Okay, well, I really think that... [dial tone beeping]",Michael
Has she been on the phone the whole time?,Pam
Yeah. Sorry you had to hear that. It was a lovers' quarrel.,Michael
Make-up sex. Nice!,Dwight
Nice.,Kevin
"Okay, let's get personal for a second, shall we?",Michael
"The scary thing is, it could have been any one of these people. They all had a motive. To get high.",Dwight
"Okay, well, I made up some fliers for everybody to take on your way out, in case you're ever tempted. So there you go. And, Dwight, you know, I'm very busy today. It wasn't even planning on going to the bathroom, so I don't even know if anything will come out.",Michael
just drink a lot of water.,Dwight
Well...,Michael
You have to relax your muscles around the bladder.,Dwight
"I don't... Let's just not talk about it, okay?",Michael
[reading from Michael's flier] 'Drugs: Let's not and say we did.' I think Michael was high when he wrote this.,Pam
"You know, sometimes I wish we just didn't have a conference room. [Kelly laughs] You know? He couldn't do that.",Toby
But then we wouldn't have any meetings.,Kelly
Yeah.,Toby
"Okay. Bye, Toby.",Kelly
Bye.,Toby
"Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Hello? Yes, I am so, so sorry. Yeah, actually, I don't have that information just yet. Uh-huh. Listen, do you mind if I put you on a brief hold? Okay.",Kelly
"I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner's high, which is why now I swim.",Angela
"Why would I be worried? I'm not a drug user. I would never abuse my body like that. I mean, they are plenty of other ways to have fun. My body is 100% drug-free.",Meredith
"[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Um, hold, please. [to Jim] There's a Brenda on the phone for you. [to Brenda] Just one second, I'll transfer.",Pam
[telephone ringing] [shows note to camera 'It's OK. She'll call back!'],Jim
She's got it up now.,Man
"He'll be up. Okay, sure. I'll get someone down.",Sheriff
Hey. Hey. Jerry.,Dwight
Thanks.,Sheriff
Sheriff Pierce? I'm turning in my badge.,Dwight
Where sis you get that?,Sheriff
I got it here.,Dwight
"No. No, you didn't. we didn't give you this.",Sheriff
"No, I mean at the gift shop. Also, I can't wear this anymore.",Dwight
"You were never supposed to wear this in the first place, Dwight. Come on now, seriously, you got me concerned here a little bit.",Sheriff
"Oh, don't worry. I never abused my power. I only tried to help the Sheriff's Department in any way I could.",Dwight
"Right, well... Why don't you give me a couple examples of ways that you've helped us out?",Sheriff
"Oh, God, there are so many. Roadside assistance, breaking up unruly parties, surveillance...",Dwight
Surveillance?,Sheriff
"Crowd control, directing traffic...",Dwight
Mace! You... You've been carrying around weapons-grade Mace?,Sheriff
I've only had to use it once.,Dwight
[tosses the butt of a joint in parking lot] We should get a pizza.,Vance Refrigeration Worker #1
I hate pizza.,Vance Refrigeration Worker #2
"So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?",Kevin
No.,Pam
Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.,Kevin
"Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.",Jim
Oh I got the 'Save The Date'.,Phyllis
Yeah?,Pam
"Yeah, pretty stationery.",Phyllis
"Oh, thanks!",Pam
I didn't get mine yet.,Angela
Uh...,Pam
"There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ... it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.",Pam
"Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.",Michael
"Uh, on or off?",Phyllis
Off.,I.D. Photographer
Okay... [removes glasses],Phyllis
Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?,Dwight
[leaving the room] Excuse me.,Phyllis
Clown paint.,Dwight
"I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?",Dwight
That's a nice tie.,Michael
Thank you.,Ryan
That is... who makes that?,Michael
"Um, I don't...",Ryan
Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?,Michael
"Um... let's um, let's keep our clothes.",Ryan
"It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...",Oscar
[walking into the Conference room] What's the dealio?,Michael
"Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.",Toby
What's the problem?,Michael
Angela!,Oscar
It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.,Toby
Since Christmas.,Oscar
"So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?",Michael
No.,Oscar
"Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?",Toby
Yes.,Michael
Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.,Toby
Yeah?,Michael
These things just have a way of working themselves out.,Toby
Okay.,Michael
"It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.",Toby
What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...,Michael
Okay.,Toby
Okay... what?,Michael
That was the right decision for me and my marriage.,Toby
"Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?",Michael
"[holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.",Michael
Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.,Angela
"No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.",Michael
What's the next one?,Oscar
"Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?",Michael
Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?,Angela
"Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.",Michael
"[in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using 'I' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements.",Michael
"I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.",Angela
"Come on, seriously, that?",Michael
"I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...",Oscar
"Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.",Michael
Win!,Pam
"Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.",Michael
No.,Oscar
That's... no...,Angela
"Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.",Michael
"How about, I leave it up?",Angela
"How 'bout, she takes it down?",Oscar
"How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?",Pam
"Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.",Michael
Win.,Pam
Fine.,Oscar
"But, it...",Angela
[claps his hands twice] It is done!,Michael
Win,Pam
"[snaps a photo of Creed, then Creed turns to the side for a profile shot] No, you're all good.",Photographer
Great. [gets up and leaves],Creed
"Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code.",Pam
Oh. Thanks.,Angela
"It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.",Angela
You solved it?,Toby
Yes.,Michael
"Well, good. We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers]",Toby
Are those all the other complains?,Michael
Mmm-Hm.,Toby
I would like to see those please.,Michael
I... I can't do that.,Toby
"You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.",Michael
That... [shakes head and places hand over the file],Toby
"Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it?",Michael
[sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It's all Dwight's.,Toby
"Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.",Toby
Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?,Michael
"Are you sure? [looks at Oscar, who is front of the camera, holding the baby poster in front of his chest]",Photographer
"Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.",Dwight
[shoots twice],Photographer
"[looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.",Michael
Nice.,Pam
You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.,Michael
"Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder]",Toby
"How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble 'merely listen to and forgotten...' ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?",Michael
You already did me.,Angela
"That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does 'redacted' mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted'... ?",Michael
"Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.",Toby
"Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.",Michael
"Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?",Dwight
[notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?,Pam
"All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.",Michael
"Wait, what did it say?",Pam
"Uh... [reading]'Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?' [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?",Michael
I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!,Pam
"Here is a Kelly complaint: 'Ryan never returns my calls.' Ugh, join the club.",Michael
My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes...,Ryan
I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.,Kelly
To your HR representative.,Toby
"To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.",Kelly
"Fine, I'll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know.",Toby
[crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes?,Michael
Dwight tried to kiss me.,Jim
What?!,Michael
And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.,Jim
That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!,Dwight
"Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.",Jim
"Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?",Dwight
Sure.,Toby
Stanley. [off camera],Michael
"[gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!",Pam
[still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.,Michael
"I didn't do it! [Michael and Stanley continue to talk off camera, but it's inaudible]",Anglea
I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.,Pam
"Someone complained that the men's room is 'whites only'. Stanley, you know that's not true.",Michael
I didn't say that.,Stanley
"Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]",Creed
"Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.",Michael
"No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.",Phyllis
"And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.",Michael
"Stanley and I are close, too.",Phyllis
We sit close.,Stanley
Oh... ok.,Michael
"[sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again]",Toby
"I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.",Pam
"Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.",Jim
Don't take her side.,Pam
"[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?",Jim
I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.,Pam
You mean your thoughts and feelings?,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
Yeah...,Jim
"I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.",Phyllis
"Yes, that's the problem.",Angela
I guess so...,Phyllis
"Okay, well... all settled, then.",Michael
[whispering to Angela] I don't like you.,Phyllis
"OK, Ryan. You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?",Michael
I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.,Creed
"All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution: Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.",Michael
I accept your decision!,Kevin
"Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.",Jim
That doesn't make any sense.,Dwight
"Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.",Jim
"[to Dwight, who is sitting in front of the camera] Smile.",Photographer
No.,Dwight
"I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.",Dwight
This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.,Jim
This is humongous. I am not a security threat...,Dwight
Oh.,Jim
"And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.",Dwight
What did I write?,Jim
I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.,Dwight
Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.,Toby
What box?!,Dwight
But I didn't report your snoring-,Phyllis
"Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]",Stanley
Uh. Dwight.,Michael
"Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.",Dwight
Okay! Calm down.,Michael
No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?,Dwight
"Hey, hey!",Michael
Him or me?,Dwight
Stop.,Michael
Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.,Dwight
Okay...,Michael
"Either he goes, or I go.",Dwight
Dwight...,Michael
You choose!,Dwight
Stop...,Michael
One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out],Dwight
Oh... kay...,Michael
I am not bluffing!,Dwight
Okay.,Michael
Okay?,Dwight
Yes.,Michael
"Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.",Dwight
Mm-hmm.,Michael
I deserve this. You know I do!,Dwight
[picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?,Michael
You have till five.,Dwight
"Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!",Dwight
"Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!",Michael
"Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.",Michael
"Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] 'Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.' [flips to another paper] 'Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.'",Michael
[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.,Jim
"[reading] 'This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.' [flips to another paper] 'Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can.' Gah. 'This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.'",Michael
"That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.",Jim
"[reading] 'Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.'",Michael
"Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.",Jim
"By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.'",Michael
"Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.",Jim
"The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.",Michael
Maybe Stanford would be cool.,Jim
It's a good market. Higher volume.,Dwight
Yeah. Maybe we should both go.,Jim
I have a girlfriend...,Dwight
"Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.",Jim
"Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.",Michael
"So, you going to transfer Jim or not?",Dwight
"Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.",Michael
I want an answer by tomorrow.,Dwight
"Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?",Michael
Fine.,Dwight
Good. Okay.,Michael
Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?,Michael
I can't. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.,Photographer
"Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?",Michael
You mean digital?,Photographer
It'll take like two seconds.,Michael
20 bucks.,Photographer
"Ugh... All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter.",Michael
You gotta be kiddin' me.,Stanley
"Come on, everybody.",Michael
"Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.",Dwight
"One, two, three... smile. [camera flashes, but no one smiles] Try to smile.",Photographer
"We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.",Michael
"Alright, I'm just gonna take it on three... whether you smile or not. One, two, three. [camera flashes]",Photographer
"Good, let's check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.",Michael
That'll be another 20.,Photographer
What?,Michael
"Angela, I want to talk to you about something.",Pam
[off camera] You just press the button.,Michael
What?,Angela
"No, Pam.",Jim
[looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.,Pam
"Pam, it wasn't her.",Jim
What?!,Pam
I'm the one who complained about you.,Jim
I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.,Jim
"[off camera] Okay, good. Check that out.",Michael
"You know, it was one day.",Jim
[off camera] That's terrible.,Michael
And I took it right back. It was like...,Jim
Okay.,Pam
"Oh, dear.",Phyllis
"[off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]",Michael
It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.,Michael
"[flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I?",Michael
"But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.",Michael
"[on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]",Jim
"Okay, Jan will see you now.",Female worker
"Oh, thanks.",Jim
And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.,Michael
[elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here?,Dwight
I don't know.,Jim
"Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?",Dwight
"Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.",Jim
"A prank, huh? This is official police line tape, okay? It's not a prank.",Dwight
Probably is.,Jim
"Damn it, people! Someone must have seen something! [Jim's cell phone beeping] Oh, you people are useless. Jesus.",Dwight
"[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hold, please. Dwight, it's the Sheriff. He said that it's really important. It's regarding your desk. I'll transfer.",Pam
"Oh, no, no, don't! I can't... [groans] [telephone ringing]",Dwight
"Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.",Jim
This is why I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy and you're not.,Dwight
"That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.",Jim
"No, there's no blood.",Dwight
Maybe poison?,Jim
Possibly.,Dwight
My God!,Jim
"[exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20?",Dwight
Nothing much is happening today. We are having our photo IDs taken. Whoop-de-doo. Can't always be like The Apprentice.,Michael
I know.,Ryan
"On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.",Michael
"[Dwight slurping] Okay, here we go. One, two...",Photographer
"He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair.",Dwight
"I hate it when people don't tell each other why they're angry. My dad was like that. I would say, 'What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad?' Over and over and over. And he would just look at me like I was an idiot.",Michael
I'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken.,Dwight
So there were no death threats?,Photographer
Let me see your ID.,Dwight
"There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby. And they can't decide, so they bring the baby to a wise man. Just like a manager in those days. And the wise man says, 'I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu.' See? They didn't expect that. And that fixed it. Because I think he was the dad anyway.",Michael
"There are dozens of old complaints in here. Cold cases, like the show. [imitating gonging] And Toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murder/suicides are not important enough to solve. Well, you know what? I have a problem with that. And I'm going to open up these cases before Toby can kill or rape another person.",Michael
All right.,Photographer
"That's not bad. Hey, do you do weddings?",Pam
Would you seriously want your wedding photos to look like that?,Photographer
Not bad.,Jim
I gave her a higher clearance than you.,Dwight
What does Level Red mean?,Jim
"I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing maniacally]",Dwight
Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are closed],Meredith
"No, wait. [put on a hat] Yeah.",Kevin
"You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]",Phyllis
Wow! I never thought Dwight would go postal. It's always the person you least expect and I always thought Dwight would go postal.,Michael
"Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest.",Phyllis
I'm done talking. I am a Schrute. We don't back down.,Dwight
"You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.",Phyllis
"Cage Match'? I don't know if it was in the packet from corporate, because I barely read any of it. So if you're asking if I stole their idea, the answer is no.",Michael
"Excuse me, sir! Dwight Schrute, is that your real name?",Hank the Security Guard
"Yes, sir.",Dwight
Morning.,Kevin
"Good morning. Okay, go ahead.",Hank the Security Guard
"Thank you. [elevator door closes] No, come on... God!",Dwight
"Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, 'Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening.' Makes you feel good.",Michael
Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?,Jim
"I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.",Dwight
It's a nice tux.,Pam
"I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.",Dwight
"So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.",Roy
"Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.",Pam
"Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.",Dwight
I can always kind of win at roulette.,Jim
"Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.",Dwight
Yeah.,Jim
How would you do that?,Dwight
Mind control.,Jim
[laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?,Dwight
"Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.",Jim
I don't believe you. Continue.,Dwight
"It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.",Jim
"[scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.",Dwight
"Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]",Jim
"Oh, my God.",Dwight
I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.,Michael
"[on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.",Jan
Top 80 percent!,Michael
Michael?,Jan
Yeah?,Michael
You know that I'm very serious here.,Jan
"Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!",Michael
What?,Jan
"Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.",Michael
I thought that you were their fearless leader.,Jan
"I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.",Michael
[laughs] I think you can handle it.,Jan
"Oh, come on. Come on.",Michael
"I think so, Michael...",Jan
"You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.",Michael
"Goodbye, Michael.",Jan
"Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.",Michael
"Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.",Michael
Again? We do that every year.,Oscar
"Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.",Michael
It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.,Oscar
"Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.",Michael
Yes!,Dwight
"So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.",Michael
That doesn't exist anymore.,Jim
"Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.",Michael
"No, they stopped making that show.",Pam
"Well, then, they need our money more than ever.",Michael
"You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.",Angela
There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them.,Creed
Something with animals. Or people.,Kevin
"Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is",Kelly
"We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves, and donate that money to charity?",Angela
"Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...",Michael
"Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?",Toby
"Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.",Michael
I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.,Jim
"No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.",Michael
Afghani.,Phyllis
What?,Michael
Afghani.,Phyllis
That's a dog.,Michael
"No, that's Afghan.",Pam
That's a shawl.,Michael
"Wait, canine AIDS?",Dwight
No. Humans with AIDS.,Michael
Who has AIDS?,Creed
"Guys, the Afghanistananies.",Jim
"Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.",Michael
"There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. 'I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.' [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.",Michael
What are you doing?,Jim
"Oh, nothing.",Pam
Till Death Do Us Rock.',Jim
They're wedding bands.,Pam
Oh.,Jim
"Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now.",Pam
"Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.",Jim
There's a KISS cover band in here.,Pam
Let's do it.,Jim
I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.,Pam
"Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.",Jim
I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?,Michael
"Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.",Darryl
It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.,Michael
Except my warehouse.,Darryl
"Well, actually, it's my warehouse.",Michael
"Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.",Dwight
Why are you here?,Michael
"When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.",Dwight
"Not. I said, not that.",Michael
We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.,Darryl
That's ironic.,Michael
What?,Darryl
That you are afraid.,Michael
Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?,Darryl
Dinkin' flicka.,Michael
[sighs] Dinkin' flicka.,Darryl
"I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, 'Fleece it out.' 'Going mach five.' 'Dinkin' flicka.' You know, things us Negroes say.",Darryl
Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture],Michael
"Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.",Darryl
[Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.,Jim
I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.,Pam
Yes.,Jim
"Have three stages, yeah.",Pam
"Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.",Jim
Oh.,Pam
Let's take a look. Nice.,Jim
"Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums.",Pam
What?,Jim
On the drums! On the drums!,Pam
"Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh, my God, he's the drummer and the singer.",Jim
We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.,Kevin
Wow. Oh!,Jim
"Oh, my...",Pam
"Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...",Jim
No! No!,Pam
"No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.",Jim
"No, come back! No, no, no!",Pam
Kev!,Jim
Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.,Pam
[phone rings] Yes,Michael
"[phone rings] Michael, Carol Stills for you.",Pam
Who?,Michael
Carol Stills.,Pam
Do I know a Carol Stills?,Michael
Your realtor.,Pam
"Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it",Michael
It's still me.,Pam
Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.,Pam
"Carol, you're on with Michael.",Pam
"[on phone] Hello, Michael?",Carol
"Hi, Carol. How you doing?",Michael
I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.,Carol
"Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.",Michael
"Oh, great.",Carol
"Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.",Michael
"Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later?",Carol
"Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.",Michael
"Oh, great.",Carol
"Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.",Michael
To the casino thing?,Carol
Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you...[phone rings] What do you...,Michael
What?,Carol
"Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?",Michael
"Michael, Jan's on line two.",Pam
"Okay, put her through. [Deep voice] Jan Levinson, I presume?",Michael
"It's still me. Uh, Jan, here's Michael.",Pam
Michael?,Jan
"Hey, Jan. How you doing?",Michael
"You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.",Jan
I am?,Michael
"I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.",Jan
"Oh, okay.",Michael
"Incidentally, what is the charity?",Jan
AIDS.,Michael
"Okay, then. I will see you tonight.",Jan
"Okay, sounds great.",Michael
Bye-bye.,Jan
"Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...",Michael
No problemo.,Carol
Right.,Michael
To answer your question...,Carol
Yeah?,Michael
Yes.,Carol
What?,Michael
I'd love to go.,Carol
Okay.,Michael
"I have to get a sitter, but that shouldn't be a problem.",Carol
Problem. Good.,Michael
"And I'll bring the papers, too.",Carol
"Good, All right. Sounds great.",Michael
I'll see you tonight.,Carol
Bye.,Michael
Bye.,Carol
Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.,Michael
"[People playing casino games as the actual Casino Night begins] Oh, my God!",Pam
Yeah! That's great.,Roy
"Hey, hey.",Michael
Hi.,Carol
"Hey, Carol.",Michael
Hi.,Carol
You look great.,Michael
Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here.,Carol
"Oh, well... Kiss. [Michael kisses her on the cheek, pauses and then kisses her on the other cheek] That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight [Kisses cheeks]",Michael
Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.,Dwight
"I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, 'We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.'",Dwight
Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.,Michael
Drink would be good.,Carol
Okay.,Michael
"Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I've taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things.",Creed
I'm gonna get a drink. Do you need anything?,Billy's Girlfriend
"No, I'm fine. Thank's sweetheart.",Billy
Okay.,Billy's Girlfriend
"Billy, your nurse is hot.",Michael
That's my girlfriend.,Billy
Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.,Michael
She was never my nurse. I met her at Chili's. She was my waitress.,Billy
Chili's is great.,Michael
"Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.",Michael
[Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?,Stanley
"Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled! Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.",Michael
"Okay, the game is No-Limit Texas Hold'em. Good luck, everybody. That's at least four red chips to you, sir.",Dealer
All-in. [Other players fold their hands],Michael
"Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?",Michael
I'll call.,Toby
What are... That's insane.,Michael
I have good cards.,Toby
"Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back.",Michael
"No, I'm sorry. He can't, sir. He's gone all-in.",Dealer
"Okay, all right, whatever.",Michael
Flip them.,Dealer
You really screwed that up. [Michael leaves],Michael
Wow.,Meredith
"I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.",Toby
"I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.",Dwight
[coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.,Jim
"It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.",Jim
"Wow, bad luck.",Carol
"Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning. [Sees Jan] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",Michael
Michael?,Jan
Jan.,Michael
Hi.,Jan
"Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.",Michael
"What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?",Jan
What does that mean?,Carol
"After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong.",Michael
"No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.",Jan
"Hi, hi.",Carol
Does anyone want a drink?,Jan
"No, I'm good.",Carol
Okay. [Carol stares at Michael],Jan
Um...,Michael
"Hey, hey.",Dwight
Hey. What...,Michael
Jan's here.,Dwight
Give me the dice.,Dwight
"Come on, Dwight.",Kevin
Let's go.,Dwight
"It's all on you, baby. Let's go.",Billy
"Good evening, Dwight. What is this?",Angela
"Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.",Dwight
Yes.,Kevin
Then roll an eight.,Angela
"Thank you, Angela.",Dwight
"Good luck, Dwight.",Angela
"Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling]",Dwight
"Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go.",Kevin
Let it ride. Let it all ride.,Oscar
Give me the dice!,Dwight
"Yeah, right.",Jim
"Yeah, right,' what?",Pam
What was this? [Makes face],Jim
[Laughs] I have good cards.,Pam
Really?,Jim
"Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in.",Pam
Wow. I think you're bluffing.,Jim
"Yeah, I think she's full of it.",Kevin
Straight.,Pam
Oh. Three nines.,Jim
"Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen.",Kevin
Thank you very much. It was fun.,Jim
"Cosmopolitan, please.",Jan
"Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? That's a long drive.",Carol
"Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...",Jan
"Oh, well, actually, I guess this would be our first date. I guess.",Carol
Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport.,Jan
"Well, I'm having a nice time.",Carol
"Oh, me too. Me too.",Jan
"One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.",Ryan
"So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?",Jim
All right!,Michael
"The point is four. Shooter, roll it. Four!",Dealer
"Come on, shooter!",Dwight
"Four! [Holds dice in front of Carol] Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. [Holds dice in front of Jan] All right, here we go!",Michael
All right.,Carol
Yeah!,Michael
Five.,Dealer
So close. So close.,Michael
Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson?,Dwight
What?,Jan
Super 8?,Dwight
"No, I...",Jan
Motel 6? Best Western?,Dwight
I didn't... I don't know...,Jan
Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?,Dwight

All-in.,Kevin

"Good Luck, honey.",Bob Vance
"Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play.",Phyllis
Three queens.,Kevin
"Nice, very nice.",Dwight
I have an ace.,Phyllis

Yes!,Bob
"Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?",Phyllis
I suck.,Kevin
"She took you down, huh?",Roy
I do not want to talk about it.,Kevin
"Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock.",Roy
Yeah?,Kevin
"Yeah, you guys wanna play our wedding?",Roy
Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay?,Kevin
Whatever. I'm in charge of the music.,Roy
"Dude, you will not be sorry.",Kevin
Sweet. All right.,Roy
All right.,Kevin
Smoke?,Jan
"No, thanks. You having fun?",Jim
Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.,Jan
"Yeah, we all really...",Jim
"Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed",Jan
"Well, I think you look great.",Jim
Why did I hook up with Michael?,Jan
"Yeah, why did you?",Jim
"It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?",Jan
"Oh, yeah.",Jim
Good. Have you told anyone?,Jan
No.,Jim
"Well, you should.",Jan
"Excuse me. Big moment. The evening's chip leader and winner of this beautiful mini-refrigerator courtesy of Vance Refrigeration, Creed Bratton, Dunder Mifflin!",Bob
Thanks. I never owned a refrigerator.,Creed
"Sorry, babe. I am just beat.",Roy
It's okay. I'll see you at home.,Pam
"Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right?",Roy
Okay.,Pam
"If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?",Roy
"Okay, will do.",Jim
See you.,Roy
Bye! Hey.,Pam
"Hey, how's it going?",Jim
"Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.",Pam
"Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?",Jim
About when you want to give me more of your money?,Pam
"No, I...",Jim
Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight.,Pam
I was just... I'm in love with you.,Jim
What?,Pam
"I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...",Jim
What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?,Pam
I just needed you to know. Once.,Jim
"Well, I um... I... I can't.",Pam
Yeah.,Jim
You have no idea...,Pam
Don't do that.,Jim
...what your friendship means to me.,Pam
Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be,Jim
I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault.,Pam
Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.,Jim
Hey. I'm leaving.,Jan
"Hey, okay.",Michael
"So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.",Jan
Thank you.,Michael
"And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.",Jan
Okay. Thanks for coming.,Michael
Nice to meet you.,Jan
"You, too.",Carol
And you guys have a good time together.,Jan
Okay. Talk to you Monday.,Michael
Yeah.,Jan
Goodbye.,Carol
Good night. She's a good boss.,Michael
She seems really nice.,Carol
"Oh, she's great.",Michael
"Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.",Michael
"[On phone] About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say. Yes, I know. Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend. Yeah, he's great. Yeah, I think I am. [Jim enters] I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... [They kiss]",Pam
"Everybody, in the conference room now, please. Thank you. Time is money.",Michael
Do you need anything?,Dwight
No.,Michael
Should I get water or donuts?,Dwight
No.,Michael
"Come on, let's go. Take a seat.",Dwight
"What's going on, Michael?",Oscar
I want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.,Michael
Office Depot!,Dwight
"Good. Yes, that will work. All right. Now I need a plural noun. [All groaning]",Michael
"Apparently Michael has come up with a Dunder Mifflin Mad Lib, and he's making us play it with him. We are so happy. No. I'd like to choose a different adjective.",Pam
How about a location?,Michael
The planet Caprica.,Dwight
Where the hell is that?,Michael
It's from Battlestar Galactica.,Dwight
"Okay, all right.",Michael
I am going back to my desk...,Stanley
"No, no, no. No, no, not until you give me an adjective.",Michael
Annoying.,Stanley
We already have that. So...,Michael
Frustrating.,Toby
"No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey's good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun.",Michael
Ass.,Phyllis
"Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn't so hard. All right, here we go. 'Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons.'",Michael
"Yeah, get them, Creed!",Dwight
"One of them was named Michael Scott, and he was an...' Oh, damn it. Okay. Okay, okay, we're... Okay, we're starting over.",Michael
My charity is the Farm Defense Fund. It's one of the best organizations that fights infestation of the beet armyworm.,Dwight
"My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's Department, because Dwight's a Volunteer Sheriff. So I thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him.",Jim
"I don't believe that Jim moved that coat rack. But if he did, he has an obligation to use his gift wisely. With great power comes great responsibility. They could do a cross-section of his brain to find out more. But I don't think it's true, though.",Dwight
"Look, if anything goes missing, we will reimburse.",Michael
Yeah. Can Dunder Mifflin afford that?,Darryl
"Dang! Paper making paper, I.e. money.",Michael
What?,Darryl
Paper money. [clears throat] Yeah. The company's doing fine.,Michael
"Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.",Darryl
Hey. Okay. You know what? Don't even think. I command you to just go down and have fun tonight. All right? Don't think about it.,Michael
"Our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton. Hardworking, motivated, dynamic. Every single last one of them. They follow my lead. I sort of set the tone. And it doesn't hurt that my ex works for corporate. Jan loves this branch, and I think that's really more than half the battle.",Michael
"It is extremely stressful, planning a wedding by yourself. It's like a job. I mean, it's fun, but it kind of becomes like work. I've already planned it all out in my head. But it's just in my head.",Pam
"Hey. Meredith, right?",Meredith's Vet
"Oh, God. Oh, no. I have this problem all the time. I never remember people I've had sex with.",Meredith
I'm your vet.,Meredith's Vet
"Oh, right.",Meredith
And we had sex in the parking lot.,Meredith's Vet
"Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore. I got Jim's uh, old job. Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will",Ryan
[after 'the kiss'] You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.,Jim
Me too. ...I think we're just drunk.,Pam
No I'm not drunk. Are you drunk?,Jim
No... [Jim leans in for another kiss] Jim---,Pam
Are you really gonna marry him? [Pam nods] ...Ok.,Jim
"[sobbing] Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim! [serious]",Dwight
No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody 'faggie'. Why would anybody find that offensive?,Michael
OK I think Oscar would just like if you used 'lame' or something like that.,Toby
That's what faggie means!,Michael
No not really...,Toby
Apparently you called Oscar 'faggie' for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.,Toby
"It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard!",Michael
"All right Michael, but Oscar's really gay.",Toby
Exactly!,Michael
I mean for real.,Toby
"Yeah, I know.",Michael
"No, I mean he's attracted to other men.",Toby
"OK, a little too far, crossed the line.",Michael
"OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual. Yeah, he told me this morning. And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion.",Toby
I would have never called him that if I knew. You don't... You don't call retarded people 'retards'. It's bad taste. You call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded. And I consider Oscar a friend.,Michael
"Listen man, I am so sorry. I had no idea.",Michael
"No, it's fine.",Oscar
"No. No it's not. I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people 'faggie' since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know? I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing. Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.",Michael
"That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.",Oscar
[in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much.,Angela
"No, I'm not gay. And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... [sighs] Uh... yeah I'm gay.",Oscar
"I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.",Jim
Why did I transfer to Stamford? I think that's pretty obvious. I got promoted! And you can't beat that view... right?,Jim
"Hey, Big Tuna! You're single right?",Andy
"Uh-huh, yeah. I am.",Jim
She's pretty hot huh? [Jim nods] She's completely crazy. Steer clear Big Tuna. Head for open waters.,Andy
OooOK.,Jim
OooOK.,Andy
"I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day. So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna. ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name.",Jim
"Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know? Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him. I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it? [laughs] I graduated in four years. I never studied once. I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, 'Here Comes Treble.'",Andy
"So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch. And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber. Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them.",Josh
"Oh, I can do that.",Jim
Jim's nice enough. I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this. [makes classic 'Jim'-camera face] What is that?,Karen
Can you tell who's gay and who's not?,Michael
Of course.,Dwight
What about Oscar?,Michael
Absolutely not.,Dwight
"Well, he",Michael
"Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...",Dwight
[deep sigh] There could be others... I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else.,Michael
"You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.",Dwight
"Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.",Michael
"Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman.",Michael
I really don't think so.,Dwight
"I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?",Michael
[creepy smile],Dwight
Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them.,Michael
Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.,Dwight
That's ridiculous.,Michael
Yeah probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot.,Dwight
[sighs] Let's call him and get the website.,Michael
Definitely.,Dwight
What's gay-dar?,Jim
"Well, they're sold out.",Michael
Damn. [thinks] I'll try Brookstone.,Dwight
I miss that.,Jim
Chicken or fish?,Roy
[loud sigh] Chicken.,Pam
So you havin' a good day?,Roy
"Excellent, thanks.",Pam
"Good, glad. OK.",Roy
"Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet, a few days before. And I can't really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food. So we froze it. But I'm, I'm doing well. I have my own apartment. I'm taking art classes. And I have lunch for the next five weeks.",Pam
"After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest. I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted. I gotta win her back.",Roy
"I got them a toaster. They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me. I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster. So now my house has got two toasters.",Stanley
That is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you.,Kelly
"Yes I'm super cool. I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton. Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.",Oscar
"Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up. It's terribly loud. I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on. He's so talented.",Angela
"OK. Who put my calculator in Jello? Good one. But uh, seriously, guys who did this? Seriously guys, who did this? I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND!",Andy
"You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.",Jan
"I watch the L Word. I watch, Queer as F***, so...",Michael
That's not what it's called.,Jan
"OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?",Toby
What? What does that even...,Michael
"Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.",Jan
"Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade? It's not like gay... shame festival.",Michael
"All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault.",Toby
I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? Maybe! Is that what this is about?,Michael
NO!,Jan
I don't kn--,Michael
"No, it's not possible.",Jan
Anything's possible.,Michael
"You know, imagine... you were gay.",Jan
"[laughs] Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!",Michael
"Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now. Do you understand?",Jan
"The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.",Michael
Am I the first gay man you ever knew?,Oscar
"Trick question! Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know. Is that the right answer?",Michael
"Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer.",Pam
"Uh, Michael knows Pam. He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons.",Dwight
"[looking at gay porn] Nothing wrong with this stuff. At all. This is fine. You know what. Gay porn, straight porn, it's all goooooood! I don't particularly get into this. But uh, you know what. I totally see the merit! And actually... it is quite beautiful.",Michael
Ah damn pop-ups.,Dwight
What are you doing?!,Oscar
Watching some of your friends.,Angela
"[yelling] All right, everybody in the conference room! I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight! JUST GET IN HERE! RIGHT NOW!",Michael
"Did you know that gay used to mean happy? When I was growing up it meant lame. And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.",Michael
"We're all homos! Homosapiens. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people. I mean anybody could be gay. Business-men. Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here. However you want to do it. Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you.",Michael
"Yes I'm gay. And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever. Can I sit down now?",Oscar
": I'm not offended by homosexuality. In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain. And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing.",Creed
Who should be the judges and juries of our society?,Michael
Judges and juries!,Angela
"Yes, that's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law. I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them. So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right?",Michael
: That sounds great.,Kevin
"I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.",Dwight
No one else in this office is gay.,Oscar
What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!,Dwight
I'm getting married to Bob Vance.,Phyllis
"That's great. Congratulations Phyllis. That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing! [laughs] See? Everybody has a chance!",Michael
"But still, Phyllis, in college? Did you ever experiment with other women? A lot of women do!",Michael
"No, you knew me in high school. Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.",Phyllis
[laughing] Right! [serious] And I take that as a compliment.,Michael
Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---,Phyllis
"Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---",Michael
You sound pretty defensive Michael.,Oscar
"No, I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero!",Michael
I think the problem with this office is that,Oscar
No no no. The only signal that I am sending is:,Michael
"Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen. I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag.",Michael
"I don't think I can work here any longer. This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.",Oscar
"You misunderstand-- OK. You know what, OK. I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is. You ready? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. Oscar is my friend ---",Michael
I would rather not.,Oscar
"...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!",Michael
"No, NO! I don't want to touch you, ever consider that? You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!",Oscar
"All right, um... sorry.",Michael
"Michael... I'm sorry. That was a good idea. Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]",Oscar
[sobbing] I'm sorry I called you faggie. You're not faggie. You're a a good guy.,Michael
Michael appears to be gay too. And yet he is my friend. I guess I do have a gay friend.,Dwight
"[embracing Oscar]You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes. I want you to watch this. And I want you to burn this into your brains. Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come. Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this. [awkwardly kissing Oscar] I did it. See. I'm still here. We're all still here. [everyone claps]",Michael
"[Dwight gets up to kiss Oscar] Oh come on! Dwight! Come on, man!",Michael
"We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature. But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder. What is love... anyway? Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar... and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?",Michael
"I am glad that today spurred social change. That's part of my job as regional manager. But you know what? Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed. ...that's what she said. Or he said.",Michael
"Oh, there's Gill. Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows?",Michael
"I was going to quit. But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gill and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.",Oscar
[reading the note with the gay-dar] 'Hope this helps. -Jim' Nice!,Dwight
[Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body] What are you doing?!,Oscar
"Shhh. Don't be scared. [gay-dar beeps over Oscar's belt buckle, Dwight smiles] It works. [gay-dar goes off next to Dwight's belt buckle] ...oh no.",Dwight
"[on speakerphone] Okay, what is your goal for after lunch?",Jan
I will do my job to the best of my abilities.,Michael
[under breath] Heaven help us. [aloud] Specifically.,Jan
I will do my,Michael
Specifically,Jan
"Specifically, Jan, I will make at least ten phone calls to clients.",Michael
"Yes, I have to begin every day by letting Jan know what I intend to accomplish, and then I have to call her at the end of the day to tell her what I",Michael
"[on speakerphone] Are you on the toilet, Michael?",Jan
[quietly] No.,Michael
"Well, I know sometimes you are and... that you wouldn't tell me, so I'm just going to assume that you are, and call me back when you're finished.",Jan
Okay. [Jan hangs up. Toby opens the office door.],Michael
Michael?,Toby
[sigh],Michael
"Hi, honey. You holding up?",Michael
Yup.,Pam
Yeah.,Michael
I'm... painting my new apartment tonight.,Pam
"Oh, good. By yourself?",Michael
Yes.,Pam
"Aw. Well, hang in there, okay? You know what? You should get one of this big body pillows. That way you wouldn't miss you-know-who so much.",Michael
Thanks.,Pam
Roy.,Michael
Right.,Pam
What do I think? I think everybody should stay out of everybody's personal business!,Pam
"Yes, I'm gay.",Oscar
[shocked expression],Meredith
Why are all the best-looking single men always gay?,Meredith
"Hey, Big Tuna. You ever Google Google? What do you think would happen?",Andy
Let's find out. [starts typing],Jim
[makes frustrated noises],Andy
Oh! Lots of results.,Jim
"I didn't mean you should do it. You were supposed to ponder it. It's... You removed the fun. Thanks a lot, Big Tuna.",Andy
Pam?,Michael
Yeah?,Pam
Did you see Oprah yesterday?,Michael
"No, I didn't.",Pam
"I, uh... I am going to be a father.",Michael
What was Oprah about?,Pam
"Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.",Michael
That's a really big decision.,Pam
I know.,Michael
Maybe you should wait before you adopt.,Pam
Well...,Michael
Or not adopt.,Pam
"Just do it, okay?",Michael
"Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.",Pam
"Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?",Michael
"You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.",Pam
Eight months?,Michael
Yeah.,Pam
I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months.,Michael
You probably won't.,Pam
"You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby...",Michael
"No, Michael.",Pam
Twenty years.,Michael
"No, Michael.",Pam
Thirty.,Michael
Sure.,Pam
It's a deal.,Michael
All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.,Ryan
Yesh.,Michael
"Uh, fun jeans.",Ryan
Right there. Ah.,Michael
Sign.,Angela
Per diem.,Michael
"Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.",Michael
"Don't be mad, it is a business trip.",Dwight
But I don't understand. It's for managers.,Angela
"Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.",Dwight
I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?,Angela
"Yes, Monkey.",Dwight
"Don't 'Monkey' me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M.",Angela
"In the Martin family, we like to say, 'Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.' That's code for 'check out the slut.' What is... why are there flies in here?",Angela
"Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?",Kelly
This.,Pam
You look so pretty.,Kelly
Thank you.,Pam
"Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that.",Pam
"Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.",Kelly
"Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom?",Michael
My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.,Kelly
"Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.",Michael
And your veil.,Dwight
"Yeah, do it!",Michael
I'll probably just wear this.,Pam
"Really? Okay. Well, word of advice: unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?",Michael
Um...,Pam
"Um. Okay, um.",Michael
Um.,Dwight
You got that?,Michael
I got it.,Dwight
Write it down.,Michael
I got it.,Dwight
Um.,Dwight
Um.,Michael
"[singing] Um, um, um...",Dwight and Michael
There's my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train?,Creed
"That was for per diem, for Philadelphia.",Angela
That town smells like cheese steaks.,Meredith
That town is full of history!,Angela
Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her. [introducing himself] Creed.,Creed
Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?,Dwight
"Hey, Michael.",Josh
"Hey, Josh, how ya doing?",Michael
Pretty good.,Josh
"Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns.",Michael
"I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut.",Michael
"It's really good to see you, man.",Jim
"Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!",Michael
"Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?",Dwight
"Yeah, sold about forty thousand.",Jim
Hey!,Michael
Shut up. That's impossible.,Dwight
"No, it's not. I did. Yep.",Jim
"Well, I did it too.",Dwight
"You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.",Jim
So did you hear?,Kevin
What?,Toby
Pam's back on the market again.,Kevin
Really? She's dating?,Toby
"If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.",Kevin
So what kind of commissions you get up there?,Dwight
"Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.",Jim
You're so immature!,Dwight
"Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman.",Josh
Ah.,Michael
"And I just want to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I'm going to look for a place for you at Stamford.",Josh
"Oh, hey!",Jan
"Hey, Jan.",Dwight
We all checked in?,Jan
Yes.,Josh
"Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.",Jan
Okay.,Josh
Okay!,Jan
"Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.",Michael
What are you talking about?,Jan
"The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.",Michael
"Step away from me, Michael.",Jan
Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.,Michael
"Alan's cartoon is so funny, right?",Kelly
Mm-hmm.,Pam
"And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time.",Kelly
This party is going to be awesome.,Dwight
I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.,Michael
Check it out.,Dwight
That is crooked on that side.,Michael
Wow.,Dwight
Hey hey!,Michael
That is a lot of liquor.,Jim
Yeah.,Michael
And a dart board.,Jim
"Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop.",Michael
We should probably head on down and hook up with Jan.,Josh
"Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?",Michael
"A shot of MIDORI, perhaps.",Josh
"Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.",Jim
Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday.,Michael
"Um, we should...",Josh
Yeah.,Jim
"All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.",Michael
"I'll do a shot, Michael.",Dwight
"Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet.",Michael
SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.,Michael
"Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin.",Michael
"Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.",Dwight
All right.,Jerome Bettis
I'm a huge fan.,Dwight
"Thanks. I appreciate it, guys.",Jerome Bettis
"You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.",Michael
"All right, maybe. If I can.",Jerome Bettis
"Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there?",Michael
"No, you cannot.",Jerome Bettis
So maybe. See ya.,Michael
Why do they call him The Bus?,Dwight
Because he's afraid to fly.,Michael
Smile!,Dwight
"Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!",Michael
"All right, Jan just emailed me. She wants us to meet her up front.",Josh
"Yep. Yeah, she's up front.",Michael
You don't have email on your phone.,Dwight
"I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?",Michael
No one just called you.,Dwight
All right.,Josh
"All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.",Jim
I'll see you soon.,Ted
"Yeah, stop by later.",Josh
[into phone] See you in a bit. Bye-bye. [to Dwight] May I have a moment of your time please?,Michael
I need you to do something for me.,Michael
Yes. Anything.,Dwight
I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.,Michael
"I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.",Dwight
"Hey, Pam.",Toby
Hey! What's up?,Pam
"It's, uh... I was... might ask if you wanted...",Toby
"[answering phone] Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. [hangs up] Sorry. What's up?",Pam
"Um, if, uh... um... I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It's so weird.",Toby
"Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here.",Pam
Okay.,Toby
"So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.",Dwight
And?,Michael
He wasn't volunteering today.,Dwight
Business has been pretty crazy around the office.,Michael
Oh yeah?,Jim
Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.,Michael
"Oh, tell him I say hi.",Jim
I will call him later with that message.,Michael
"Hey, how is... Toby?",Jim
Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?,Michael
"Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...",Jim
"Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.",Michael
"Michael, it's really not a competition.",Jim
Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope. We can grab lunch with them tomorrow.,Josh
Great!,Jan
"Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.",Michael
Whoa. Michael.,Dwight
"Wow, oh my God, thank you.",Waiter
You're welcome.,Michael
Was that your per diem?,Dwight
"No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.",Michael
"What have you generated, Michael?",Jan
I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.,Michael
What party?,Jan
"The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.",Michael
"Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7.",Jan
"You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.",Phyllis
"If you do that, you're going to have to put out.",Stanley
"Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out.",Phyllis
Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.,Angela
Any messages for 308? All right.,Michael
"Hey hey, fellers.",Michael
Michael.,Jim
"Hey, Michael.",Dwight
What's up?,Michael
"Well, Jim and I have a meeting with Uni-ball in about forty-five minutes, so we should probably go now.",Josh
"Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.",Michael
I don't think so.,Josh
"Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.",Michael
Fine! All right.,Josh
Okay! Excellent. Oh...,Michael
Keep the wing flaps.,Dwight
"Shut it. [answering phone] Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. [to others] Say hi to Pam!",Michael
"Hi, Pam.","Jim, Josh, and Dwight"
"Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. [to others] Pam says hi. [into phone] Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.",Michael
You first.,Michael
"Come on. Nice try, Josh!",Dwight
"Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.",Michael
"Or what? We didn't bet anything, Michael.",Josh
"Well, let's...",Michael
"Yeah, we should go.",Josh
Come on!,Michael
We gotta go.,Josh
Come on!,Michael
Uh... we'll do it later.,Josh
"Say, while I have you here, could I talk to you about some new and exciting advances to our product line?",Evan
Fine.,Michael
"Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.",Michael
That is so true. Ready?,Evan
"Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.",Michael
Great.,Evan
"Sorry, my meeting ran late.",Michael
Really?,Jan
"Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.",Michael
They're exclusive with Staples.,Josh
Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.,Michael
Yes! Ha!,Dwight
"Well, Michael, I underestimated you.",Jan
"Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.",Michael
Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.,Jim
D?,Angela
"Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!",Jim
"So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.",Kelly
"Oh, great.",Alan
I don't want ketchup.,Ryan
You love ketchup! He loves ketchup.,Kelly
So how do you come up with your cartoons?,Pam
"Well, I just, uh... I kinda think about stuff that I see, or dream them.",Alan
You dream in cartoons? How fun!,Pam
"Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend.",Michael
I thought there was a party in here.,Guy
This is the party.,Michael
This is room 308?,Guy
"Party central! So, what can I do you for? [Guy leaves] All right.",Michael
"See, this one is great, because it can work on a couple of different levels.",Alan
Huh.,Pam
[French accent] Freedom fries for the table.,Alan
Freedom fries. Yeah.,Pam
"Yeah. I mean, people always say, like, 'Don't be edgy.' But I don't know any other way. Yeah, you get it.",Alan
"Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.",Pam
"Yeah. Next time bring some of your illustrations, I'll let you pick my brain.",Alan
More freedom fries.,Pam
Yeah.,Alan
That's great.,Pam
Okay.,Alan
"I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know.",Pam
Michael. Am I the first to arrive?,Jim
People have been filtering in and out.,Michael
Can I get a drink?,Jim
What?,Michael
Can I get a drink?,Jim
Sure. You like Cosmos?,Michael
Yeah.,Jim
"Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?",Michael
Michael...,Jim
"I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just...",Michael
"Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss.",Jim
I'm not better than Josh.,Michael
"Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.",Jim
Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.,Michael
"No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.",Jim
"I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.",Michael
"Nope, that's okay.",Jim
Yeah.,Michael
That's all right.,Jim
"I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling.",Michael
"Yeah. Okay, maybe.",Jim
Are we early?,Evan
"Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.",Michael
Hey.,Jim
"Evan, this is Jim.",Michael
How are you?,Jim
"Hey, uh... Arnie Reisman. Michael, Jim.",Evan
"Hey, Ernie, how ya doing?",Michael
Do you guys work together?,Evan
"No, we used to. Now we're friends.",Jim
Best friends.,Michael
"Some people need dozens of friends to say, 'Hey, look at me, I'm popular.' But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.",Michael
"Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? [lights go out, leaving Michael's black light on] Ha, ha, ha.",Michael
"Ha, ha, ha, ha.",Dwight
Whoa. What are those stains?,Michael
"Blood, urine, or semen.",Dwight
"Oh, God, I hope it's urine.",Michael
"Today I'm headed to Philadelphia for the annual Northeastern Office Supply Convention. [makes horns gesture and heavy metal scream] Wooo-yaaaaah! Oh, these things tend to be kind of crazy.",Michael
[Angela enters Michael's office] Ah.,Michael
Sign.,Angela
"Per-diem. [singing as he signs] Perrrr-diiiiieeeemmmm! [shows off $100 bill to Ryan] You know, Ryan, it's all about the Benjamins.",Michael
[reading checklist] Fun jeans.,Ryan
[points to door] Right there.,Michael
Fourth quarter projections for Jan?,Ryan
"Yes. What? Oh, yeah, have Pam give those to me.",Michael
Will do.,Ryan
Sure you don't want to come?,Michael
Yeah.,Ryan
Gonna be fun! Change your mind we can get you a cot.,Michael
[shakes his head],Ryan
"A couple of years ago, I went to one in Hartford. 'Connecticut.' And Todd Packer and I went to this bar and met a girl. And [laugh] Packer decides to make out with her. Turns out that her boyfriend is the bouncer at the bar. [laugh] I love this. The bouncer chases us out to Packer's Vette, jump in the Vette, he",Michael
See that factory?,Michael
Mm-hm.,Dwight
I almost worked there.,Michael
No!,Dwight
"Yup. Yeah, I applied for a job there.",Michael
What would you have done? Been manager?,Dwight
I was going to be a bottle capper.,Michael
You? A bottle capper?! [laughs in disbelief],Dwight
"I know, I know. Crazy world. Crazy, crazy world.",Michael
"Yes, I'm aware of Jan and Michael's... history. Um, I don't really like to talk about it 'cause it's unprofessional. Kind of gross.",Josh
"Josh reminds me of a guy I went to high school with. Big football star, girls loved him. Whatever. Guess what he's doing now. He's a TV announcer for the Eagles. Up in the... [laughs] He doesn't even get to play in the game, I mean.",Michael
"So, you ever been convicted of a felony?",Dwight
"What? Uh, no. [to Jim] Uh, I want you to make sure you call Karen and get her to fax that vendor list over.",Josh
Misdemeanor?,Dwight
"Um... When I was in the Coast Guard, a couple of us broke into the women's barracks and we got arrested for trespassing.",Josh
Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater?,Dwight
[stunned],Josh
"[Jim, Josh, and Jan walk in the hotel lobby] Josh, um... [Jim continues walking ahead] Why don't you come up to my room for a couple of minutes and we can just go over the schedule for tomorrow together.",Jan
Can we do it over breakfast? It'll be...,Josh
A quick drink?,Jan
"Thanks, but maybe another time.",Josh
[putting on a good face] Great! [walks off],Jan
[waiting on Pam to be done with the microwave] Ahhhhhhhhh. [whispering loudly] I'm hungry.,Michael
Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!,Michael
"Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go!",Michael
[directing people to their assigned seats] Take a seat down there. Second from the end.,Dwight
"Alright, everybody here? Yes.",Michael
[walking in with a tray of six popcorn bags] Popcorn anyone?,Pam
Yes pleeeeease! Thank yooouuu!,Michael
[with five popcorn bags left] Anyone else? Nooo.,Pam
"Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast. Then we watched a medical video. Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.",Pam
Entourage!,Michael
"Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?",Michael
Yes!,Kevin
Why him?,Dwight
Don't whine. Get the window. [Dwight exhales],Michael
Previously on Varsity Blues...,Michael
"Ok. Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play. So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year...",Kevin
[walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello?,Jan
Not everyone approves of Movie Monday. I won't say who.,Dwight
I don't approve. I don't.,Angela
Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room],Jan
[Jan walks in on Movie Monday] Hi Jan! Hope you brought the Milk Duds!,Michael
How would a movie increase productivity Michael? How on earth would it do that?,Jan
People work faster after...,Michael
Magically?,Jan
No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.,Michael
No.,Jan
[walking past Dwight's desk] Kitchen.,Angela
"Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.",Angela
That's not going to happen.,Dwight
You know she has it out for him now.,Angela
That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart!,Dwight
"Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms.",Dwight
"Dwight, you should be running this office.",Angela
Michael would never let me...,Dwight
"It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.",Angela
I could never do that!,Dwight
Fine! Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!,Angela
"I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits. But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.",Angela
"At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it. I'm told it started as a team building exercise. Unfortunately I really suck at it. We didn't play many video games in Scranton. Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor. And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.",Jim
"[on the phone] Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. [Kelly screams with excitement into the phone and Pam has to take it away from her ear]",Pam
"Kelly really likes to online shop. Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes. I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes.",Pam
[pulling her new shirt out of a box] Ok.,Pam
[gasps] I love it!,Kelly
Really? I don't know.,Pam
"You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on.",Kelly
"Not at work, I'll try it on---",Pam
Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch!,Kelly
...noooo,Pam
[clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch!,Kelly
Why did you do that?!,Andy
"I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.",Jim
We're on the German team. Shoot the Brittish.,Andy
"[turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?",Jim
[laughing] Yeah.,Karen
"[outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH! GAH! [breathing heavily]",Dwight
[answering the phone] Hello?,Jan
Is this Jan?,Dwight
Who is this?,Jan
This is Dwight Schrute. I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.,Dwight
"You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.",Jan
It's about Michael.,Dwight
What about him?,Jan
[exhales] I can't talk here. It's too sensitive.,Dwight
It's not about a surprise party is it?,Jan
"No, but we should discuss that another time.",Dwight
"Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.",Jan
"Pull over at exit 40. There is a Liz Claiborne outlet. I know you like that store. Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.",Dwight
How do you know I like that store?,Jan
Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.,Dwight
How do you know that?,Jan
Part of my job.,Dwight
No it's not. It's officially not.,Jan
...noted.,Dwight
[walking into Michael's office] I'm going... to the dentist.,Dwight
Ok.,Michael
I have to have an emergency crown put in.,Dwight
Ouchy.,Michael
Yes. It's a new dentist. He's far. I might be gone... three hours.,Dwight
"Three hours, wow. Have fun. [Dwight walks away staring through the blinds at Michael]",Michael
Did you get anything good?,Dwight
Yeah.,Jan
New blouse? Halter top? Camisole? Teddy?,Dwight
I can save the branch.,Dwight
Really?,Jan
If you let me run it.,Dwight
Ok.,Jan
[excitedly] 'Ok' I can run it?,Dwight
What would you do differently?,Jan
Mostly get rid of waste. Which is half the people there. And clean house. [to waitress in diner] Right here. It's all for me. Thank you.,Dwight
"Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.",Jan
"The decision to turn on Michael was difficult. [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So [cutting his food, giving Jan a 'so there' look], here we are. It's all, on the table. I want... the branch. And I await your decision.",Dwight
"[shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way. There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here. I know you like their earrings.",Dwight
[thinks for a second] Where is it?,Jan
[on speakerphone with Michael] Michael.,Jan
Hi.,Michael
I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.,Jan
Oh. That's nice.,Michael
"No, it wasn't. Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.",Jan
...what?,Michael
Mm-hmm.,Jan
...you were at the dentist?,Michael
You can't have people undermining you. Get control of your branch immediately.,Jan
Ok.,Michael
What was Dwight thinking? That he could turn Jan against me? She's my ex-lover! ...ish.,Michael
[Pam walks out of the bathroom wearing her new red shirt] Woooooow.,Phyllis
It's,Kelly
It's really something.,Phyllis
[smiling] It's too much.,Pam
What?,Kelly
I'm gonna return it.,Pam
"No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.",Kelly
[walking into the break room] Hey.,Roy
Hi.,Pam
You look nice.,Roy
Thanks.,Pam
Isn't that like your third soda today?,Kelly
"Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company. [someone dims the lights, signifying that it's game time] Ok, see you next week. Bye. [to Karen] Again?",Jim
Scared?,Karen
[with her hands making the rocker sign] Call of Duty!,Karen
"[sounding upset] Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute?",Josh
Now?,Andy
Yes now.,Josh
Put the game on hold everyone.,Andy
"This is not working, ok? We are getting slaughtered out there.",Josh
It's the new guy. [looks at Jim],Andy
"Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...",Jim
See what I mean?,Andy
"We just need a strategy, ok? We're going to set up a trap in the gun room. All right Jim, are you using the MP-40 or the 44?",Josh
"Um, sniper rifle?",Jim
SNIPE--,Josh
WHAT?,Andy
JIM!,Josh
Are you playing for the other team?!,Andy
"You don't snipe in Carrington, ok?",Josh
Saboteur!,Andy
"Andy, it's not---",Josh
Saboteur! I'm going to kill you for real. This game--- the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you.,Andy
Hey Dwight.,Michael
Hey.,Dwight
Do you want an M&M?,Michael
No thanks I'm stuffed.,Dwight
"No seriously. You should have an M&M, they're really good.",Michael
...ok. [takes and eats several M&M's],Dwight
"They're good, huh?",Michael
...so good.,Dwight
Hey. I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.,Michael
"They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...",Dwight
Sounds like a good dentist.,Michael
"Oh, yeah.",Dwight
What's his name?,Michael
[long pause] Crentist.,Dwight
Your dentist's name is Crentist.,Michael
Yep.,Dwight
Huh. Sounds a lot like dentist.,Michael
Maybe that's why he became a dentist.,Dwight
Let me see your teeth. Let me see 'em. Let me see 'em.,Michael
[reluctantly opens his mouth and Michael peers inside] Ahh. Aaaah.,Dwight
You should... floss.,Michael
I know...,Dwight
[exhales] Well then... I am glad you're ok.,Michael
"Business is like a jungle. And I... am like a tiger. And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick. Does the tiger fire the monkey? Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch? [smiling] Pun. There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head. We don't have the technology.",Michael
"Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?",Michael
"[in Michael's office] Wow, this is tough.",Michael
What?,Dwight
Ohhhh. Arrrgggh!,Michael
What is it?,Dwight
"Well, I just got off the phone with Jan. And um... she demoted me.",Michael
No.,Dwight
Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!,Michael
Gahh!,Dwight
"And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.",Michael
I can't believe this news. That--- wow.,Dwight
I know. I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally.,Michael
You said that?,Dwight
"Yep, I did. I did. But I think... you should do it.",Michael
"Well... Gosh, if you think I should. Then I will.",Dwight
"[exhales] Perfect, well, we're settled.",Michael
All right.,Dwight
"All right. Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager.",Michael
"Assistant to the regional manager. Thank you Michael, for staying on. I really appreciate it.",Dwight
Ohh..,Michael
Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.,Dwight
[muttering] Can't you? That's so nice.,Michael
Well... I guess we should go tell the troops.,Michael
"Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. [Dwight exhales, Michael looks at the camera] Ok let's do it.",Dwight
"Hey, hi, hello. Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news. I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.",Michael
You're kidding...,Phyllis
"You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.",Michael
Congratulations Dwight.,Angela
Thank you Angela.,Dwight
But... why Dwight?,Stanley
"Because, Dwight... never lies.",Michael
How does that qualify him to run a branch?,Stanley
Because that's all it takes.,Michael
"Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?",Michael
"Thank you Michael. I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black! With ferocity!",Dwight
"Michael, what will you do?",Phyllis
"Oh, I'll be fine.",Michael
Do you have any savings?,Kevin
"No, no, I don't, but---",Michael
"Michael, you might lose your condo.",Kevin
I... won't. I won't.,Michael
"I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager.",Pam
Maybe I'll quit.,Phyllis
It's really happening!,Angela
Yes.,Dwight
We can make a difference here.,Angela
I,Dwight
You alone? Because I thought together we could---,Angela
"Oh please, don't be naive. But you can be in charge of the women.",Dwight
[whispering] Look how cute he is! He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade.,Karen
I'm sorry what are you whispering about?,Jim
"I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around.",Karen
I'm trying---,Jim
Just tap S then D.,Karen
Oh.,Jim
[her players gun is pointed directly at Jim's player's head] Any... last words? No?,Karen
"What? [Karen's player shoots Jim's player, 'You killed Jim Halpert' appears on the screen, Karen giggles]",Jim
Wow. Psychopath. [Karen grins widely at Jim],Jim
What?,Pam
I'm just looking.,Creed
Please go back to your desk.,Pam
In a minute.,Creed
"Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work. But I'm gonna keep the clothes. I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas.",Pam
"Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.",Michael
[smiling] No thank you.,Dwight
"It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it.",Michael
No thanks.,Dwight
What?,Michael
Not my style.,Dwight
But you said you liked it. You've always admired it.,Michael
"Well that was before. I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage. Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.",Dwight
[Michael finally breaks] Take it back.,Michael
[confused] No.,Dwight
That's my car.,Michael
What did you---,Dwight
THAT'S MY CAR.,Michael
Yes.,Dwight
"I know, Dwight. I know. I know. I know.",Michael
You know what?,Dwight
Jan called me about your little meeting!,Michael
No!,Dwight
"I know, what you did. I made the whole thing up, Dwight.",Michael
I think the Sebring's cool. It's cool. The Seabring's cool. It has a cassette and it has a CD.,Dwight
"Oh do you? Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?! How dare you, Dwight?",Michael
[Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don't fire me. Please.,Dwight
Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!,Michael
[terrified] I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!,Dwight
Not. Good. Enough!,Michael
[sobbing] I'll do anything! Anything! I'll do your laundry for a month! For a year!,Dwight
I have a laundry machine!,Michael
"I'm sorry! I'll do anything, I swear. [squeaking, crying]",Dwight
I don't know if I can trust you anymore.,Michael
"You can't. You can't. But I promise I'll never betray you again. What can I do, Michael. What can I do? [Michael exhales] What can I do? [Dwight has his face to the ground but his butt raised high in the air] What can I do? What can I do?",Dwight
"You can get up. Get up. [Dwight gets up with spit hanging from his lips] And you can hug it out, bitch. [Dwight and Michael have a firm embrace]",Michael
"Hug it out, bitch. That is what men say to each other, after a fight. They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go. And walk away. And they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman however. I have found. It doesn't translate.",Michael
"[leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]",Jim
"[throws some desk material in the air to signify debris from the grenade explosion, grins as Jim walks away]",Karen
"Yep. Yeah, we hugged it out. But, it turns out, I was still a little angry. So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more, [cut to Dwight standing on a box with 'LIAR' written on a piece of paper hung around his neck, Dwight's head hung in shame] and I'm making him do my laundry for a year.",Michael
Okay. [Jan leaves Michael's office; Dwight enters],Michael
Hey. [shuts door] Is everything okay?,Dwight
"It is not your business, Dwight.",Michael
"If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.",Dwight
"What do you know about management, Dwight?",Michael
I know that we need to cut costs. We could fire Meredith. That's a big cost.,Dwight
I'm not firing anyone.,Michael
"Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.",Dwight
... What?,Michael
"Four nights a week, I sleep under my desk, and then three nights I stay at my place in Toronto. They don't know about this job up there. It's a welfare state. Beautiful countries, both of 'em.",Creed
"Okay. Here we go. Everybody, you know what? It dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted, Let's get back in there. [no takers] Come on. Movie Monday! Come on, Stanley let's go.",Michael
[standing at the supply shelf] I'm on the phone.,Stanley
Ryan?,Michael
I'm pretty sure Jan said that we're not supposed to.,Ryan
"Okay, well, we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together, so I guess I will just go play some online Scrabble.",Michael
[looks to Angela],Dwight
[shakes her head disapprovingly],Angela
"The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood... It's amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn't explode.",Dwight
"So, she sleeps with him, but she is still in love with the head surgeon, um, the McDreamy guy, and she starts crying, but the dorky doctor, he's in love with her... [phone rings]",Michael
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. ... Uh, sure, I'll get him for you. [to Michael] It's Jan for you.",Pam
Really?,Michael
Yeah.,Pam
"I may have a few weeks ago faked a call from Jan in order to get out of a synopsis of, I think it was, Navy: NCIS. Since then, Michael's been suspicious.",Pam
Nnnnice. Wow!,Kevin
"[playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone's left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you... [Karen's desk is empty]",Jim
"Hey, Jim?",Jan
"Hey, Jan.",Jim
How's work going?,Jan
[nervously] Pretty good.,Jim
"[kills Jim's character, giggles] Oh, you know what, I gotta see Josh right now, but remind me to tell you what Dwight said to me earlier, okay? You'll get a big kick out of it. [leaves]",Jan
[baffled expression],Jim
Things are a little bit... different here in Stamford. [shrug] It's not bad.,Jim
"Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?",Michael
"Uh, no thanks, I'm good.",Ryan
"Oh, it's okay, I'm going down.",Michael
"Um... Yeah, absolutely.",Ryan
"All right, I'll be right back. [goes down pretend stairs]",Michael
[laughs uproariously and applauds] Whoo!,Dwight
[hands Ryan pencil] There you go.,Michael
Awesome!,Dwight
Thank you.,Ryan
You're welcome.,Michael
"Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?",Dwight
Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute. [goes back down pretend stairs and grabs pen from Stanley's desk],Michael
Okay. [continues to laugh] Whoo!,Dwight
"There you go, fresh from the warehouse.",Michael
"Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?",Pam
"There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam.",Michael
But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.,Pam
"Yeah. Yes, it's better. It's great.",Ryan and others
"[breathless] All right. Okay. [goes back down pretend stairs, crawls on belly to the kitchen for the coffee]",Michael
I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys. Gotta keep the troops entertained.,Michael
[after Michael returns with coffee] With cream and sugar?,Pam
[sighs] All right.,Michael
"[on speakerphone] So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.",Jan
"Oookay. Let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan? Or does somebody miss me?",Michael
"Michael, Ed died over the weekend.",Jan
"Oh, wow.",Michael
"Attention, everybody. I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first. My old boss Ed Truck has died.",Michael
"Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news! You must feel so sad.",Kelly
"Yes, I am. It's very sad. Because he was my boss.",Michael
That's a shame. Ed was a good guy.,Phyllis
"That's right, you worked with him. So did Creed. Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by. Cheer me up.",Michael
So did you hear the news?,Michael
The news that you just announced? That Ed died?,Pam
Yeah.,Michael
Is there anything I can do?,Pam
"Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really? It's... pssssh... . He was almost 70. Circle of life.",Michael
Yeah.,Pam
[holds out arms to Pam],Michael
Oh. Okay.,Pam
Yeah. Mmmmmm.,Michael
[extricating herself] Okay.,Pam
"What's going on with Fairfield County schools? Karen, did you generate that price list?",Josh
"Um, shoot. Uh, I will. Sorry.",Karen
"Okay, just get it done. Jim, will you make sure?",Josh
"Oh yeah, definitely.",Jim
"[coughing out his words] Suck up! Josh, did you hear what I said?",Andy
"Thank you, everyone.",Josh
[at vending machine] Dammit.,Karen
What's up?,Jim
"Uh, nothing. They're just out of Herr's chips.",Karen
Oh.,Jim
But don't worry about it. My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority.,Karen
"Mmm, that's where you're wrong. I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require. So, I think we should go get some. Now, please.",Jim
"It's a real shame about Ed, huh?",Creed
Yeah. Must really have you thinkin'.,Michael
About what?,Creed
"The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that.",Michael
Ed was decapitated.,Creed
What?,Michael
Really?,Dwight
"He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6. He slides under an 18 wheeler. Pop. It snaps right off.",Creed
Oh my God.,Michael
That is the way to go. Instant death. Very smart.,Dwight
You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.,Creed
You're thinking of a chicken.,Dwight
What did I say?,Creed
"That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry. Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.",Michael
"[clears throat] So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...",Michael
Ed was decapitated.,Dwight
What are you doing?,Michael
You said you didn't know how to say it.,Dwight
I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.,Michael
Hey.,Dwight
Hi.,Angela
"If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.",Dwight
I do not wanna talk about this.,Angela
"When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.",Dwight
"I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here.",Michael
"[on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael. I really do. So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?",Jan
"You really don't get it, do you? You don't understand these people. That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.",Michael
"Well, what would you suggest?",Jan
[thoughtfully] A statue.,Michael
Of Ed?,Jan
Yeah.,Michael
[scoffs] I'm not sure that's realistic.,Jan
"Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.",Michael
"No, that's not---",Jan
"We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...",Michael
"That is not a statue, that is a robot.",Dwight
I think that is a great way to honor Ed.,Michael
And how big do you want this robot?,Dwight
Life-size.,Michael
"Mm, no. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us.",Dwight
What the hell are you two talking about?,Jan
"Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.",Michael
"You know what, Michael? I've really tried with you today...",Jan
Mm hm.,Michael
...and I have to get back to work.,Jan
Oh do you? You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.,Michael
So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.,Jan
But Ed truck can't because he is---,Michael
Goodbye. [hangs up],Jan
DEAD.,Michael
Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.,Dwight
That's perfect.,Michael
"Okay, that is a 'no' on the on the West Side Market.",Jim
"Okay, great. I think that's enough. Can I get back to work now?",Karen
Wow. Never pegged you for a quitter.,Jim
I am NOT a quitter. I will do this all day if you want.,Karen
Really?,Jim
"Yeah, all day.",Karen
Hey. What are we doing? What's the game? I want in.,Andy
"Oh, there's no game. We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.",Jim
Did you check the vending machine?,Andy
"Oh, the vending machines! How did we miss that?",Karen
I have no idea. We went right for the copier.,Jim
Mm.,Karen
And then we checked the fax machine.,Jim
"Yeah, nothing there.",Karen
Did you check your... butt?,Andy
"Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam.",Michael
Okay that's enough.,Phyllis
What?,Michael
We do not wanna hear about this.,Stanley
"Well, you know what? I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham! His cappa is detated from his head!",Michael
You have just spit on my face.,Stanley
"Well, you know what? There's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here. Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!",Michael
"There are five stages to grief, which are [glancing at computer screen] denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad. And that's hard. And it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance. And if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job.",Michael
"I am going to throw you this ball. When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works. I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck. And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.",Michael
"Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam. There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car.",Roy
"Okay, fine. Hurry back.",Michael
[as they leave] There's nothing wrong with your car. I just thought you might like a break from the 'grief counseling' session.,Roy
Oh. I would like a break.,Pam
How are you likin' the new car?,Roy
Great.,Pam
Yeah? Sure is small. Got airbags?,Roy
"I think so. I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.",Pam
"[laughs] Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you? Yeah.",Roy
"[on phone] Hi, yeah. This is Mike from the West Side Market. Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah. You have 'em in the warehouse. Great. What is my store number... six. Wait, no. I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen].",Jim
[laughing] Six?,Karen
"[as Pam returns to conference room] Okay, we can start. Um...",Michael
You waited for me?,Pam
"Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?",Michael
"[grabbing ball] I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.",Dwight
"Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else.",Michael
[throwing ball back] Nope.,Stanley
"[returning ball to Stanley] Oh, yes Stanley. Come on. Your turn, you have to go.",Michael
I will NOT. [throws ball back],Stanley
Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.,Michael
"Let's see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.",Pam
"Wow. If you wanna cry, that's okay.",Michael
"[catching ball] Thanks. Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.",Ryan
Do you want to talk about it anymore?,Michael
"Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.",Ryan
"Me, me, me, me, me me. [catches ball] Yes. Okay, um. I was trying to throw this party once. And everyone was over for the weekend. And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so...",Kevin
Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's. [upset] Do you think that this is a game?,Michael
"Well, there is a ball.",Phyllis
"All right, we're starting over.",Michael
"No, I'm done.",Stanley
You are not leaving. No! We are not done.,Michael
We really have a lot of work to do right now.,Angela
"Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk. [breaking down]",Michael
"Michael, look. I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life. I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die. And I had to keep going.",Toby
How do you know?,Michael
What?,Toby
That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing?,Michael
It was obvious...,Toby
"Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING! [runs out of conference room crying]",Michael
Michael! [following Michael downstairs] Michael. Michael ...,Dwight
"[seeing bird] Oh, God!",Michael
[in disgust] Oh...,Dwight
"Oh my God! Oh my God, come on ...",Michael
Poor little fella.,Dwight
Oh shhhh--oot!,Michael
He is a goner.,Dwight
"No, he's not.",Michael
Yeah.,Dwight
"No, he's not. [cradling bird next to face]",Michael
"Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria!",Dwight
"Well, you can't get diseases from a bird!",Michael
A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!,Angela
We don't know if it's dead.,Michael
"Ugh, no that thing is",Kelly
You want me to flush him?,Dwight
Attention everybody. This will only take a second of your time. Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.,Michael
I have a lot of work to do.,Meredith
"Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith. But that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby killed this bird. And now we are going to honor it.",Michael
But...,Angela
"No, no, no! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now. [to Dwight] Find a box for him.",Michael
I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal.,Karen
Nice!,Jim
[on phone] Bonjour. Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's. Non? Ah... merci quand meme. Au revoir.,Karen
Sounded good.,Jim
Thanks.,Karen
[crying],Kelly
"It's okay. It's okay. [pats Kelly on shoulder] Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show.",Michael
"I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight?",Kelly
[trying to shove bird into a can] Argh... gah!,Dwight
What are... What are you doing?,Michael
"What? No, this is about the right size.",Dwight
"No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!?",Michael
"I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute.",Dwight
I need a box. I need a box. A small box... not too confining.,Dwight
Is it for the bird?,Pam
Yeah.,Dwight
I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box],Pam
"Oh, thank you.",Dwight
If you wanna do something for the funeral...,Pam
"Yes, please.",Dwight
Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.,Pam
Excellent.,Dwight
Do you have it with you?,Pam
Always. [runs off],Dwight
Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into.,Pam
[spotting Herr's chips on her desk] Where'd you find them?,Karen
Where'd I find what?,Jim
"I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.",Jim
Glad you could all make it.,Michael
You told us we had to.,Kelly
"Dwight, do you have the box?",Michael
"Actually, I have it.",Pam
You made this? Wow. [impressed] That's... that's very nice.,Michael
When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it. And I remember thinking 'I'm a little too old for this.' And I was,Ryan
I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.,Pam
Yes.,Michael
"What do we know about this bird? You might think, 'Not much. It's just a bird.' But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.",Pam
"Oh, I remember that. That was SO funny.",Kevin
"And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.",Pam
He's not a songbird.,Dwight
Shhh.,Michael
"An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone. Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten.",Pam
[quickly] Amen.,Angela
[begins playing recorder],Dwight
[singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin. You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...,Pam
"Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.",Michael
Let's get back to work.,Dwight
Hey Jimmy. Want to see some pictures of my baby?,Hannah
Umm... sure.,Jim
[shows picture] Here he is.,Hannah
[chuckles] He's so cute.,Jim
And here's his first bath. Warning: contains nudity.,Hannah
"That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?",Jim
You think we should have left our baby in the tub alone? [Jim shakes head] Talk to me when you have kids.,Hannah
Sounds good.,Jim
[on the phone] Ed Truck died over the weekend.,Jan
"Oh, wow. He...",Michael
"Yeah. And I know... I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know.",Jan
Does his family know?,Michael
"Yes, they know, Michael.",Jan
But I'm the first in the office?,Michael
"I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects.",Jan
"Okay, yes, sure, I will do that...",Michael
Good.,Jan
"...'Cause I'm the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over? [Jan hangs up]",Michael
"Ed Truck died. And it blows. They say that with grief, time makes it worse, which is bad for me because I found out before anybody so I've had more time to be sad.",Michael
"Attention, everyone. As you know, Ed Truck is dead. If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook, remove it now. Also, if you have any photographs, Pam will make her shredder available during lunch. That is all.",Dwight
"Remembering the dead doesn't help anybody. The way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again. In this case, some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck, or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body. I'm working on both.",Dwight
"I would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon, because I am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor. We need to find out what is blocking you. And that way, we'll be able to honor Ed the way he deserves to be honored. May he rest in peace.",Michael
...ces. [chuckles],Kevin
"What was that, Kevin?",Michael
Nothing.,Kevin
"No, you said something, didn't you?",Michael
"May he rest in pieces. [chuckles] You know, because there's, like, two pieces of him.",Kevin
You think that's funny.,Michael
No. [chuckles],Kevin
You are disgusting.,Michael
"Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor.",Dwight
"No, that can't be right.",Michael
"Well, I am trained in grief counseling, but, ahh, I don't think that's what they need right now.",Toby
"Well, then I guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, doesn't it?",Michael
Hey there.,Roy
Hi.,Pam
So how's your day going?,Roy
"Well, I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone I've never met.",Pam
That sucks. [laughs] You guys got it much harder up here.,Roy
"Closer to the epicenter, I guess.",Pam
"[laughs] Cool, all right.",Roy
"Well, as you know, Ed Truck passed away. So, I'm here to talk about it if anyone would like to.",Toby
Not really.,Kevin
"You're ruining it, already. They should not be given the choice.",Michael
I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way.,Ryan
Is anyone having any trouble eating?,Toby
No.,Kevin
Concentrating? Is anyone having trouble getting their work done today?,Toby
I'm having trouble getting my work done today.,Stanley
"Well, look, sometimes things crop up later. So, uhh, you should know I'm always available if anyone would like to talk.",Toby
"Wow. Wow. No. No. You are the most heartless, soulless person I've ever met.",Michael
"Michael, I'm sorry...",Toby
"No. No. Shh. Enough. It is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here. Dwight, Ryan, I want you to take the table out. We're gonna go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we're going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, I would like you to forget everything that Toby has said, okay?",Michael
"I don't think I'm overstating it when I say that Toby is a plague on this company. And he is worthless. You give people a chance to shine and they blow it, just like you knew they would. Grief counseling is not about, 'Are you hungry? Would you like a sandwich?' These people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats.",Michael
"Okay, part of the problem was that Toby talked at you. Now, I am going to talk with you. First off, I want you to be comfortable, because you really can't grieve if you're all tight and buttoned up. So, guys, loosen your ties, just take your jackets off if you want. Ladies, let your hair down. You know what? Even take your shoes off. I wanna get personal and I want you all to really open up. And I want you to know that anything and everything can be said.",Michael
Okay. I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off.,Angela
My feet do not smell. Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition.,Kevin
"I found an exercise in Toby's binder that he managed to miss, that involves screening the part of you that says, 'I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna talk about that. That is too private.' Here's how it works. I'm going to throw you this ball.",Michael
"Yeah, the ball-throwing exercise is in the binder. It's in the section marked, 'Fun Ways To Make Brainstorming Sessions Explode With Excitement and Creativity.'",Toby
"Hey, my cousin Billy, they just had the twins.",Roy
Really?,Pam
Yeah.,Roy
"Wow, I thought that was supposed to be, like, next month.",Pam
"Yeah, I know. I guess they couldn't wait. I'll bring in a picture if you...",Roy
"Yeah, I'd love to see them. Oh, and tell them I say, 'Congratulations.'",Pam
Sure.,Roy
I should probably head back in.,Pam
Yeah?,Roy
"But, umm, thanks for the break.",Pam
No problem.,Roy
[in his office playing with a Dunder Mifflin Truck when it drops and the 'head' of the Truck comes off],Michael
"Michael once told me that Home Alone is the saddest movie ever. When I asked him why, he said, 'Because the whole family forgets the kid at home. There is nothing funny about that.'",Pam
"That's... Hold it, hold it, hold it. Start, like, right in there. [Dwight digs hole in ground] Just dig.",Michael
Ow! God!,Dwight
"Okay, give it to me. You don't know what you're doing. All right. [Michael starts digging]",Michael
Hey! Hey! What are you guys doing over there?,Man
"Nothing. Let's just... all right. [talks to warehouse guys] Guys, do you have a box we could use?",Michael
Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?,Dwight
A dime and a nickel.,Ryan
"No, I said one of them is not a nickel.",Dwight
But the other one is. I've heard that before.,Ryan
"Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...",Dwight
Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.,Ryan
A man is found hanging from the ceiling...,Dwight
"He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.",Ryan
A hunter.,Dwight
It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.,Ryan
Damn it!,Dwight
Tell me what you did yesterday.,Jan
Uhhh... nothing.,Michael
Nothing?,Jan
"Yeah, nothing. How was your day?",Michael
I don't care how your day was Michael.,Jan
"Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?",Michael
Tell me what you did yesterday.,Jan
I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?,Michael
"Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.",Michael
"Hi, Pam.",Jan
Hi.,Pam
"I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?",Jan
"Oh, I don't know if I'm...",Pam
Thanks Pam.,Jan
"It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.",Pam
So you excited?,Dwight
Yeah.,Ryan
Very excited?,Dwight
Yes. I'm very excited.,Ryan
Extremely excited? ... Just very? That's cool.,Dwight
"I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.",Ryan
"I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?",Dwight
"So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?",Ryan
"When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.",Dwight
[squeaky chair] Hey.,Karen
What?,Jim
My chair is squeaking.,Karen
Is it?,Jim
You took my chair.,Karen
"No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.",Jim
"When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so...",Karen
So I guess I can't get up.,Jim
"Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.",Michael
"Do you know where we are, temp?",Dwight
I know where we're not.,Ryan
"I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When... Damn it.",Dwight
"Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.",Andy
Sure.,Jim
Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?,Andy
That's it? That's what you came up with?,Karen
I'm acting my heart out here.,Andy
Really?,Karen
"Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.",Andy
"Attention Scranton Business Park, there will be complimentary pretzels in the lobby from now until 4 o'clock as a thank you to our loyal tenants.",Announcer
Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.,Pam
"Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.",Michael
"[looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh... Come on.",Michael
"And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.",Dwight
I don't think you know what you're saying.,Ryan
"Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?",Dwight
Uh huh.,Ryan
It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.,Dwight
Gotcha.,Ryan
"Oh hey, I forgot something in my car. I'll be right back.",Dwight
Ok. [Dwight drives away] Of course.,Ryan
"I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.",Stanley
Because they acted all tough and everything...,Kelly
Uh huh.,Michael
"But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...",Kelly
"[Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?",Michael
I'm just saying hi to Bob.,Phyllis
"No, I think you're cutting in line.",Michael
"Well settle down, Scott.",Bob
"No, I'm not going to settle down.",Michael
No way.,Stanley
Get in the back please.,Michael
Boooooo. Booooo. Back of the line.,Stanley
Boooooo. Thank you. [hi-five's Stanley]. That's right.,Michael
What a pair of Mary's.,Bob
This is Pretzel Day.,Stanley
"Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor. I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.",Ryan
Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.,Dwight
[rocks in squeaky chair],Karen
"[sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,",Jim
stop.,Karen
"Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me",Jim
"This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please.",Karen
"fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,",Jim
This is not a proportionate response.,Karen
"Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.",Jim
I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?,Andy
Michael.,Pam
"No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind.",Michael
Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.,Pam
I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.,Michael
"Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.",Pam
"Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.",Michael
"You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.",Pam
"Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.",Michael
It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.,Dwight
"Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.",Ryan
You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?,Dwight
Yeah.,Ryan
Come on!,Dwight
Thank you! [takes pretzel],Stanley
Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.,Michael
We do.,Pretzel guy
Thank God.,Michael
"And we have 18 different toppings. We have sweet glaze, cinnamon sugar, chocolate, white chocolate, fudge, M&M's, caramel dip, mint chip, chocolate chip, marshmallow, nuts, toffee nuts, coconuts, peanut butter drizzle, Oreos, sprinkles, cotton candy bits, and powdered sugar.",Pretzel guy
"Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?",Michael
The Works. You got it.,Pretzel guy
All right! Thank you!,Michael
Please be seated. [man runs behind Dwight],Dwight
Who was that?,Ryan
Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.,Dwight
Is that your Cousin Mose?,Ryan
Yes.,Dwight
"Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore.",Dwight
What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?,Dwight
Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.,Ryan
Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?,Dwight
Depression?,Ryan
Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?,Dwight
I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?,Kelly
Sales take a long time.,Angela
"Oh my God, I'm so worried.",Kelly
I'm sure Dwight will protect him.,Angela
I don't know. Dwight's so weird.,Kelly
"He's not weird, he's just individualistic.",Angela
"No, he's a freak.",Kelly
You're a freak!,Angela
"Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?",Dwight
"Um, loneliness. Maybe women.",Ryan
"Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.",Dwight
No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over. OK.,Ryan
Wrestle him to the ground.,Dwight
"No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.",Ryan
Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?,Dwight
"Bye, Ryan. He seemed nice.",Cousin Mose
Where are all the animals?,Dwight
"Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.",Dwight
"You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.",Dwight
"Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.",Ryan
Screwgun. The sales call!,Dwight
[Michael is listening to 'Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter' and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey!,Kevin
"Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?",Michael
Establish time frames. Keep the phrase 'real dollars' in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.,Dwight
"Wait, can you go back?",Ryan
"Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.",Dwight
"Ok, I'm going to establish time frames.",Ryan
Good.,Dwight
I'm going to put everything in terms of 'real dollars'.,Ryan
Right.,Dwight
I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.,Ryan
Uh huh.,Dwight
"Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.",Ryan
Exactly. Yes.,Dwight
"I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.",Ryan
"Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second...",Michael
Second?,Toby
"Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.",Michael
"Account...? Michael, what is going on?",Kevin
And I will be taking questions.,Michael
"Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?",Pam
What's on your suit?,Phyllis
"Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!",Michael
They really didn't like me.,Ryan
They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.,Dwight
I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.,Ryan
"Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.",Dwight
You drive.,Ryan
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.",Pam
"[Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.",Dwight
I think about that all the time.,Ryan
"Night, Pam.",Kevin
Night.,Pam
"Hey, what time is it?",Michael
20 past 5.,Pam
AM or PM?,Michael
PM.,Pam
"Oh, good.",Michael
These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?,Pam
Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.,Michael
This is a huge sale.,Pam
Yes. Right. Good.,Michael
"Night, Michael.",Pam
Goodnight!,Michael
[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin.,Pam
"Ah, hey.",Jim
Oh my God.,Pam
Hi.,Jim
Hi.,Pam
"Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.",Jim
Oh.,Pam
"And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?",Jim
I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.,Pam
Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?,Jim
"Yeah, totally. So...",Pam
So...,Jim
Do you...,Pam
"Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.",Jim
"Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here.",Pam
"Oh, good.",Jim
A little different. What time is it there?,Pam
"What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.",Jim
"Oh, yeah. Right.",Pam
How far away did you think we were?,Jim
I don't know. It felt far.,Pam
Yeah. I have a question for you.,Jim
What?,Pam
How many words per minute does the average person type?,Jim
I type 90.,Pam
Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.,Jim
It's true.,Pam
"Ok, I said average.",Jim
70? How many do you type?,Pam
Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.,Jim
Come on. Tell me.,Pam
No.,Jim
You have to tell me now.,Pam
"65. Ok, no need to laugh.",Jim
"No, it's, that's respectable.",Pam
Respectable?,Jim
"So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself...",Pam
Right.,Jim
Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home...,Pam
Ok.,Jim
"And, I'm freaking out.",Pam
Yeah.,Jim
That movie is so scary!,Pam
I know!,Jim
But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.,Pam
No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?,Jim
Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.,Pam
"No, you're making this up!",Jim
Would I make that up?,Pam
"Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.",Jim
"Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.",Pam
And how many kitchens?,Jim
I have one kitchen.,Pam
"Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.",Jim
It's actually...,Pam
Most apartments these days have like three.,Jim
Three kitchens?,Pam
Yes! How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?,Jim
"[Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok?",Pam
Pam?,Jim
Yeah. Yeah.,Ryan
Pam?,Jim
"Um. Ok, bye.",Pam
"Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.",Jim
"No, I was um...",Pam
"Oh, no no.",Jim
You have to go?,Pam
"Yeah, uh, well.",Jim
"No, I should probably go too.",Pam
Ok.,Jim
"I mean, yeah.",Pam
Yeah. Bye Pam.,Jim
Bye Jim.,Pam
"Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day.",Stanley
"What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.",Jan
"Well, that's really not the way I roll, because sometimes I'm in the zone, and sometimes I'm in the zoning out.",Michael
Zoning out?,Jan
Do you want me to go on Amazon and order you a slang dictionary? Cause I'll do it.,Michael
If you can account for your time...,Jan
"Yes, big if.",Michael
...then maybe corporate can justify your salary.,Jan
A woman spurned.,Michael
It's like mommy and daddy are fighting. Except mommy outranks daddy and mommy is way scarier.,Pam
Take a good look at this boy...,Dwight
I always do.,Michael
...because you are never going to see him again.,Dwight
If you lay a finger...,Michael
Today is Ryan's first sales call and I am bringing this boy home a full-grown man.,Dwight
"Would you look at that? [Hugs Ryan] [Dwight attempts hug] Damn it, Dwight! Come on.",Michael
"Dwight is taking Ryan on a sales call today. So if we find Ryan's body in a heavily-wooded area tomorrow, I owe Jim $30. It's an old bet, but a deal's a deal.",Pam
"I once saw a movie called 'Training Day'. It starred an African-American and Ethan Hawke. In it, the African-American trains Ethan Hawke with various tests and trials. Today, Ryan is Ethan Hawke, and I am the African-American.",Dwight
Get in the car.,Dwight
I don't have a key.,Ryan
Don't you realize the key is inside you? [pretends to pull key out of Ryan's ear],Dwight
He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. Today's gonna be great.,Ryan
"No, but seriously, your ears are the key. 90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking.",Dwight
Huh.,Ryan
Get in the car. [Ryan knocks the car door] Get... get in the car.,Dwight
Sales is not all in here. [wails arms] It's also in here.,Dwight
What was that first thing you did?,Ryan
"[wails arms] You know, selling, typing, dialing.",Dwight
Oh.,Ryan
What is that in your ear? [pretends to pull beet seed out of Ryan's ear] A tiny beet seed. You need to clean your ears better.,Dwight
It's going okay. I've already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I'd know.,Ryan
"9:00 to 10:00, checked in with receptionist. Met with Jan, RE: log. Lost log. Found log.' '10:00 to 11:00, light salad, three points.' That's on the wrong page.",Michael
"Hey, let's focus today. Make today all about focus. I'll help you.",Pam
"Okay. That sounds good. [puts banana in toy mouth that's in his mouth] [laughs] Yes. Actually, today's a good day to do that.",Michael
Yeah.,Pam
"You know, every time I think I hit rock bottom at my job, the floor opens up, like at a carnival ride. I'm gonna retrace my steps. College, four-year degree, student loans, business school, alone in a beet field. I... there's a step missing. 'Hey, mom.' 'Hey, Ryan. How's that five-year plan coming?' 'Oh, it's great. Today, I knelt down in cow manure and I got abandoned in a beet field.' 'Oh, that's cool.' 'Yeah, that's really cool. I'm learning a lot. I'm really glad I took this full-time job.'",Ryan
"Sales is about people, Ryan. About understanding them and learning how to get along with them. Case study: me. To understand me, you have to know that I work in the city, but I live here on this small, beautiful farm. It's a family farm. Many Schrutes were born here and many of us end up here. My grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things. What the... Damn it! Those kids! [discovers two teenagers naked, running] You! You, get out of here! This is not a cheap motel! This is a farm and cemetery! Freaks! You're lucky I don't have my crossbow! Let me show you the compost pile.",Dwight
[in the kitchen and Stanley comes in and swipes Kevin's pretzel without Kevin seeing] Shoot.,Kevin
"There's four things that I love. My wife, my daughters, Pam Grier, and a hot, chewy roll of buttered dough.",Stanley
What makes them so good?,Michael
I do not know.,Stanley
"I mean, they're just dough twisted up with some candy. They taste so good in my mouth.",Michael
That's what she said. [Stanley and Michael both laugh],Stanley
"Look, I've never seen a Clint Eastwood movie.",Karen
"See, that's weird.",Jim
"But if you said 'Go ahead, make my day,' I would know that it's from 'Dirty Harry'. How can you not know that's from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'?",Karen
"Yo, mama! Ask me how bad I wanted to bone Jennifer Grey.",Andy
I saw the movie. I just don't know every line from the film.,Jim
"Seriously, you guys, ask me.",Andy
You didn't know that 'Bueller?' was from Ferris Bueller?,Karen
"Let's just say, me and Jennifer Grey probably would've broken a few laws.",Andy
Here you go.,Kelly
"Nice dress, Ryan.",Michael
It's not a dress. It's a kurta.,Kelly
[laughing] OK.,Michael
"Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it [girly voice] it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great. [normal voice] Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.",Michael
You look so handsome.,Kelly
Really you do. I love the material.,Pam
I know.,Kelly
How come you didn't get me one?,Michael
I...,Kelly
"Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people.",Phyllis
I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.,Pam
Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 'Sex and the City' at my place?,Meredith
"Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet.",Pam
"I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.",Kelly
"I just feel kind of tired, you know.",Pam
Maybe you've got mono.,Dwight
Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with.,Pam
"Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?",Kelly
"Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available.",Dwight
Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?,Kevin
"I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going?",Roy
"Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?",Kevin
Don't go. They eat monkey brains.,Angela
Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.,Michael
"It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.",Michael
I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.,Stanley
Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.,Michael
"I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.",Michael
"Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on.",Michael
"Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um...",Kelly
Kelly?,Michael
Sparkles...,Kelly
Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.,Michael
"Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.",Kelly
How many gods do you have?,Angela
"Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.",Kelly
[points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story?,Angela
She looks like Pam from the neck down.,Kevin
"Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...",Dwight
"All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'.",Michael
Sorry.,Jim
"I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.",Jim
Nice basket.,Karen
Thank you.,Jim
"Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians. [slide show] Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... '",Michael
I see dead people.,Dwight
Okay. Spoiler... alert.,Michael
He was dead the whole time.,Dwight
"Just stop it. [slide of Michael & Carol kissing] What's the... oh, whoa! [laughs] Where did that come from?",Michael
"Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again. I need your skinny, little arms.",Tony
Oh. Did you shake it?,Karen
"Yeah, I shook it, I shook it.",Tony
"We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I.",Andy
Scuse me?,Jim
Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.,Andy
Wow.,Jim
From 'Cheers'.,Andy
Yup.,Jim
And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?,Michael
I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'.,Creed
"Oh, that's what they call it.",Meredith
This is the best meeting we've ever had.,Kevin
"Thank you, Kevin.",Michael
I find this incredibly offensive.,Angela
"Well, I find it beautiful.",Michael
"Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.",Angela
No...,Michael
"Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these.",Toby
"No, You're not going to collect them.",Michael
Yes.,Toby
"No. This is delightful, charming culture.",Michael
My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight.,Michael

You guys ready to party?,Andy
What's that?,Jim

I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat?,Angela
It's all vegetarian.,Server
I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.,Angela
"Oh, yuck. [spits out food]",Michael
What? Too spicy?,Carol
No. These s'mores are disgusting.,Michael
They're not s'mores. They're samosas.,Carol
Do you think they have any s'mores?,Michael
"All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?",Michael
"So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh?",Ryan
[laugh] Kelly Zach Braff [speaks in Hindi],Girls

"Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.",Kelly

"[song by Beyonce Knowles] Looking so crazy, my baby. I'm not myself lately. I'm foolish. I don't do this. I've been playing myself. Baby I don't care. Cuz your love got the best of me. And baby you're making a fool of me.",Overhead
"Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?",Michael
Yes.,Kelly's Father
Wow.,Michael
How long have you been married to the cheerleader?,Kelly's Father
"Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet!",Michael
She is very fair.,Kelly's Mom
"She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks!",Michael
One. Two. Three. Shot!,Andy
Oh.,Jim
Are you okay?,Carol
"I'm going to be. [to DJ] Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec... just a sec. [speaks in microphone] Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.",Michael
Awww!,Crowd
"Oh, Michael.",Carol
What do you say?,Michael
Can we talk about this in private?,Carol
I didn't hear you. [laughs],Michael
[louder] Can we talk about this in private?,Carol
"[lowers microphone] Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay.",Michael
No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic...,Michael
"This is the ninth date, Michael.",Carol
"Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.",Michael
"I better go. Okay, you can find a way home, all right?",Carol
Yes.,Michael
Okay.,Carol

So you're saving money...,Kelly's Mom
Yes.,Ryan
...to start a family and home.,Kelly's Mom
"Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.",Ryan
Is there anything you wanted to ask us tonight?,Kelly's Father
Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.,Pam
"Is it? He's really outgoing, huh?",Young Man
"Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?",Pam
It's hot in there. How's the naan?,Pam
Dry. You look like you were having fun.,Angela
I am. You should come dance with us.,Pam
I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting?,Angela
No one.,Pam
[sings Indigo Girls] I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children...,Andy
"Andy, no acappella.",Karen
"[sings] I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.",Andy
[sing] There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line,Andy and Jim
"Wait, wait.",Andy
[sing] the less I seek my source...,Andy and Jim
"Oh, come on, guys. Please.",Karen
[sing] the closer I am to fi-i-i-ne. The closer I am to..,Andy and Jim
It's not good.,Karen

"Oh, God! [chokes on food] Oh. Wow.",Michael
Here. [hands drink],Pam
That's so spicy.,Michael
Yeah.,Pam
Oh. You waiting for a call?,Michael
Uh... no.,Pam
"Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.",Michael
"Well, you were never really engaged.",Pam
"I was in that marriage arena, though.",Michael
Yeah.,Pam
Yeah. Uuuuh... well.,Michael
I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.,Pam
We're so alike. So alike. [leans in to kiss her],Michael
What are you doing?,Pam
What are you doing?,Michael
I'm rejecting your...,Pam
I'm... what? I didn't,Michael
...kiss.,Pam
[scoffing noises] Can I have a ride home?,Michael
If you sit in the back.,Pam
"Goodnight, guys.",Karen
"Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.",Jim
"No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin.",Andy
Okay.,Jim
Oh.,Jim
"Hey dummy, get in the car!",Karen
I'm a drunk driver.,Jim
"Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car.",Karen
"Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.",Jim
"Yeah, you can't.",Karen
"No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.",Jim
Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay?,Karen
So good.,Jim
Good.,Karen
These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'.,Michael
You say one more word; I'm stopping the car.,Pam
Sorry.,Michael
"This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler. [sings] Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!",Michael
"[loud clapping, cheering, and whistling]",Crowd
How do I explain this to Jan?,Michael
"Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?",Kelly
"Oh, please, stop talking. Three words or less.",Michael
"Like, an Indian Halloween?",Kelly
"An Indian Halloween. Okay, great. [to phone] Pam, could you put Jan on, please?",Michael
"[on phone] Michael, you're on with Jan.",Pam
"Hello, Jan.",Michael
"Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?",Jan
"Well, I was letting everybody go to the big Diwali party.",Michael
What is Diwali?,Jan
What is Diwali?,Michael
Yes.,Jan
"You don't know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I'm surprised. It's the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you'd be familiar with it. It's the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It's like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween---",Michael
Mich---,Jan
---rolled into one.,Michael
Oh.,Jan
"I bet you're not even aware that our own Kelly Kapoor, who works in...",Michael
"Um, customer service.",Kelly
... customer service is a Hindu person.,Michael
Oh.,Jan
And.,Michael
"Yes, of course, I know Kelly.",Jan
Yeah.,Michael
I thought she was Muslim.,Jan
What? I'm not Muslim!,Kelly
"Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.",Jan
You do?,Michael
"Yes, of course. It's important to celebrate our company's rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event---",Jan
"Oh, I dunno about that.",Michael
"---or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself.",Jan
"For Kelly, that seems a bit much.",Michael
"Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric---",Jan
[hangs up],Michael
She's so wonderful.,Kelly
"Yeah, you should see her naked.",Michael
"I had promised Carol a romantic evening on the town. Um, I wanted to take her on this spooky hay ride thing, but it was like seventy dollars a person, and she's allergic to hay. So I said, 'Pop a Claritin, and I will spot you the seventy bucks,' and she's like 'I don't like to borrow money or take unnecessary medication.' And I'm like, 'Well you're really not gonna like what I slipped in your drink last night.' And she's like, 'What the hell are you talking about?' And I'm like, 'I'm kidding. I didn't put a roof...' [cracks himself up] ... We laughed so hard... It was hilarious... oh... [calms down] So yes, I'm very excited about the Diwali party.",Michael
"For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity. For a fraction of the cost of this DJ, you could have the rocking sound stylings of a Police cover band.",Kevin
No Police cover.,Mrs. Kapoor
"No, okay, well, let me send you a demo, and... Better yet, I'll give Kelly the demo, and she can give it to you. It'll save us both on postage.",Kevin
[nods],Mr. Kapoor
Excellent.,Kevin
You're the temp!,Carol
"Um, yeah. [shakes her hand] Ryan.",Ryan
"Hi, I'm Carol.",Carol
"Hi, nice to meet you.",Ryan
The wavy brown hair and blue eyes.,Carol
Ah.,Ryan
Michael talks about you... a lot.,Carol
Yeah.,Ryan
"Top of your class at business school, and you live on Shady Hill Road, right?",Carol
"Wow, um... Sorry you had to...",Ryan
Does Michael talk about,Dwight
[pause] Yes.,Carol
He does? What does he say.,Dwight
He says... 'I love him.' He loves you.,Carol
"At Cornell, in my fraternity, my house name was 'Hubble' because I was so good at finding a party. I was like a powerful space telescope, so... Freshman year, when my skin was still really bad, they called me El Guapo.",Andy
"Yeah. Big Tuna, tuna?",Andy
"Nope, I got eel.",Jim
[speechless],Andy
[looking for Jim's sushi] Eel... eel.,Karen
Didn't see that coming.,Andy
"And perhaps the most important person to Indian culture, Sir Ben Kingsley. Because of him, the British left India, and then he became an actor like Ronald Reagan.",Michael
Michael?,Pam
Yeah?,Michael
Your shirt is buttoned wrong.,Pam
"So, any questions?",Michael
Hey.,Karen
Hey.,Jim
Who are you faxing so early in the morning?,Karen
"Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain.",Jim
"I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] 'Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.'",Jim
No![knocks coffee out of Stanley's hand.] You'll thank me later.,Dwight
There she is - Jan Levinson. First...,Michael
Michael.,Jan
...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.,Michael
Michael.,Jan
"[singing] Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.",Michael
Michael.,Jan
Yes.,Michael
I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.,Jan
I don't understand.,Michael
The board voted last night to close your branch.,Jan
On whom's authority?,Michael
The board's.,Jan
What?,Michael
"I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.",Jan
You're welcome.,Michael
"A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.",Jan
Am I a small number person or a severance package person?,Michael
"Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person.",Jan
"Oh... [burrys head in hands] Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.",Michael
"Well, it's not all about numbers, Michael.",Jan
Well...,Michael
It's... it's about talent.,Jan
"Oh, you gotta be... Josh?",Michael
Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.,Jan
"Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?",Michael
"It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.",Michael
Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley's daughter from Stanley's desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast.,Michael
Hey stranger.,Dwight
Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.,Michael
Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.,Dwight
"Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.",Michael
"When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'",Dwight
"Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is... [clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head]",Karen
Really? Wow... that's bad.,Jim
"Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing? [Karen nods and Andy looks at Jim] In your face!",Andy
"Well, I work here now.",Jim
Mmmm.. suck-ah!,Andy
Are you okay?,Pam
"Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.",Michael
What did Jan want?,Pam
"Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so...",Michael
What can't you tell me?,Pam
"Nothing, Pam.[whispers to himself] What difference does it make? We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.",Michael
What?!,Pam
What?,Michael
You just said that we're gonna be gone...?,Pam
Do I have any messages?,Michael
"Michael, what's going on?",Pam
"Ok, ok...",Michael
"[facing the whole office] Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.",Michael
"Michael, uh... we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.",Toby
"You knew about this all along, didn't you?",Michael
Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.,Toby
Traitor. You are a traitor.,Michael
"What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?",Angela
I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.,Michael
It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.,Ryan
I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.,Angela
"If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.",Kelly
"[surrounded by clapping coworkers] Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!",Andy
"I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.",Jim
I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn't be happier.,Stanley
"It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, 'Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.' So, maybe that'll stop now.",Pam
What does that mean?,Roy
"Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.",Kevin
"I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, 'You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)'? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words.",Roy
Hey Mike.,Darryl
Darryl. Noble Darryl. [sighs],Michael
"Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.",Darryl
"I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.",Michael
I wasn't.,Darryl
"So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and...",Michael
"Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.",Darryl
Awesome.,Michael
This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.,Michael
"All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. [Looks at Dwight] Let's go.",Michael
Yes!,Dwight
"Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight.",Pam
Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.,Michael
What's the plan?,Dwight
"Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch.",Michael
Can I drive?,Dwight
No... way.,Michael
Shotgun!,Dwight
No. There's no one else.,Michael
Still.,Dwight
"Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.",Dwight
"Okay, okay. Um...",Michael
"But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.",Dwight
Why?,Michael
Christmas card list.,Dwight
You sent him cards? You never met him.,Michael
"But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.",Dwight
"Hey, do you have a second?",Jim
"Sure, what's up?",Josh
"I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?",Jim
I honestly don't. I don't know.,Josh
"Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?",Jim
"You know what, Jim, I wouldn't worry about it.",Josh
What does that mean?,Jim
Hi.,Jan
"Jan, hey.",Josh
"Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?",Jan
"[to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.",Ryan
"This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best.",Ryan
"Okay, this is it. [runs up the stairs of CFO's house, with Dwight] This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like 'Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person.' It's very dramatic. Although, I can't say I was a big fan of 'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else.",Michael
"So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.",Jan
"Wow. Uh, sure. Absolutely.",Josh
Awesome.,Jan
"Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry... I'm gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job.",Josh
Wha... excuse... why not?,Jan
"As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples.",Josh
Today?,Jan
[nods],Josh
You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?,Jan
[sighs],Josh
"Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I...",Jan
"I'm sorry, all right? It's done, it's done.",Josh
I'm gonna make some calls.,Jan
"Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.",Jim
"So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?",Dwight
I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.,Michael
"No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.",Dwight
All right.,Michael
"[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.",Dwight
"Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?",M ichael
Yes? What is the meaning of this?,Dwight
Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?,Michael
"Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.",Dwight
"Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.",Michael
"Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.",Dwight
"[no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.",Michael
"[as himself] Whoa hey, why not?",Dwight
"Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?",Michael
Okay.,Dwight
Don't touch me this time.,Michael
"[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...",Dwight
"Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?",Michael
[frightened] Uh!,Dwight
"So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.",Jan
Wow.,Jim
"And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.",Jan
Thank you.,Jim
Yeah.,Jan
"No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...",Jim
Michael.,Jan
"No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.",Jim
"Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.",Jan
Okay.,Jim
"Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again.",Phyllis
Where are we going?,Kevin
I thought maybe DJ's.,Phyllis
How about Cugino's?,Kevin
I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.,Angela
How 'bout Cooper's then?,Kevin
No seafood.,Angela
"But, I don't want to go to DJ's.",Kevin
"Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?",Angela
"Okay, forget it. [walks away]",Phyllis
Hooters?,Kevin
No.,Angela
"Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.",Dwight
[takes bottle and cleans off cap with his tie],Michael
[in Scranton] Where's Michael?,Jan
He's not here. I don't know where he is.,Pam
"[looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha... what's going on here?",Jan
We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.,Phyllis
"Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.",Jan
Yes!,Angela
Yes! [hugs Angela],Kevin
Stanley! [hugs Stanley],Phyllis
Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?,Pam
"Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him.",Jan
"Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?",Pam
Back?,Jan
Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?,Pam
"Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few.",Jan
[referring to Michael's ringing phone] who is it?,Dwight
The office.,Michael
Gonna get it?,Dwight
"No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.",Michael
I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.,Pam
Is Jim coming back.,Ryan
"That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh.",Pam
"I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.",Ryan
"Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?",Pam
"Oh, yeah, totally.",Ryan
"Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife!",Kelly
What you gonna do?,Karen
I really don't know. How you doing with all this?,Jim
"You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job.",Karen
You'd actually move to Scranton?,Jim
"Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would.",Karen
New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?,Jim
"Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that.",Karen
Hey Andy!,Josh
"[after screaming and throwing papers around in the kitchen] What's up, Josh?",Andy
I just want to say thanks. Good luck.,Josh
"Thanks, man. You, too. Totally.",Andy
Anything?,Michael
Nothing. [puts down binoculars],Dwight
What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?,Michael
Then it was an honor to have worked with you.,Dwight
"[pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.",Michael
My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.,Dwight
That was hilarious. The foam ...,Michael
"Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.",Dwight
"Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.",Michael
What were your favorite moments?,Dwight
"Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.",Michael
What about when Jan said the branch was closing?,Dwight
"God, Dwight!",Michael
"Well, it doesn't...",Dwight
"Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots.",Kevin
"No thanks, guys.",Pam
All right.,Kevin
Have fun though.,Pam
Cool.,Kevin
"Hey, I hear Jim's coming back.",Phyllis
Really? Where did you hear that?,Pam
I was...,Phyllis
"[interupting] Hey Ryan, you coming?",Kevin
"Uh yeah, we'll meet you there.",Ryan
"Awesome. Let's go, Phyllis.",Kevin
[to Pam] I'll tell you later.,Phyllis
Okay.,Pam
"Crazy day, huh?",Roy
Yeah.,Pam
"Yeah, man! I'm uh... I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here.",Roy
"Yeah, me too.",Pam
"Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.",Pam
"Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.",Jim
"Okay, yeah. Maybe I will.",Karen
Okay.,Jim
"Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So...there you go.",Karen
What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.,Michael
[picks up his beeping cell phone],Dwight
"Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!",Michael
[on the phone] Oh my God!,Dwight
What?!,Michael
"Stranford is closed! Michael, we're not closed. Stamford is closed. Stamford is closed.",Dwight:
We did it? We did it.,Michael
We did it!,Dwight
We did it! We did it!,Michael and Dwight
Right here! Right here! [pounds his chest against Dwight's],Michael
Ouu! Ou! Ouu! Ouu!,Michael and Dwight
"Yeah, baby!",Michael
In your face!,Dwight
We did it!,Michael
"Oh, man.",Dwight
How did we do it?,Michael
I don't ... have no idea.,Dwight
I don't understand.,Michael
"Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I'm 65.",Toby
The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.,Jim
"[to office worker] That's the other thing you got to watch out... [to Jim] Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.",Andy
Yeah.,Jim
So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines?,Andy
You know what? I think you just need to meet him.,Jim
"Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.",Andy
Sounds good Andy.,Jim
This is going to be an adventure.,Karen
"Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?",Jim
Right on. [to Andy] Hey is that Josh's computer?,Karen
What?,Andy
Hey!,Pam
Hey.,Toby
How'd the run go?,Pam
"Ah, pretty good. I finished.",Toby
That's great!,Pam
"Psh, why is that great?",Dwight
Because he accomplished something.,Pam
What was your mile time?,Dwight
About seven.,Toby
[scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.,Dwight
"Well, that has wheels.",Toby
"Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.",Dwight
"Really, Dwight? How fast are you?",Pam
Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.,Dwight
Really?,Pam
I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.,Dwight
"Man, what is taking Toby so long?",Dwight
"Oh, I'll just time him later.",Pam
And you'll compare the times?,Dwight
Yeah. Are you ready?,Pam
"No, my groin...",Dwight
Set,Pam
...is really tight.,Dwight
Go!,Pam
I can't... [starts running],Dwight
"Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.",Pam
Aaaaah!,Dwight
I should probably get back to work.,Pam
Here... Who's here?,Michael
Nametag?,Dwight
"Yes, please.",Michael
Karen Filippelli.,Dwight
Karen Filip... [In Italian voice] Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.,Michael
Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.,Dwight
Okay.,Michael
"My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. [exhales]",Michael
Who's next?,Michael
That's Andy Bernard.,Dwight
Andy Bernard.,Michael
If I were you...,Dwight
Saint Bernard.,Michael
...I would fire Anthony Gardner...,Dwight
What?,Michael
...before noon...,Dwight
I'm not...,Michael
...to consolidate power.,Dwight
I'm not firing somebody on the first day.,Michael
"No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.",Dwight
The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.,Dwight
Good morning!,Pam
"Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.",Michael
Okay.,Pam
"Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.",Pam
Hello?,Hannah
Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.,Michael
Hannah Smoterich-Barr.,Dwight
Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.,Michael
"You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So... As far as I'm concerned, [holds up WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] this says 'World's Best Dad'.",Michael
Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name?,Michael
Gardner.,Tony
Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you. [laughs] Okay.,Michael
Thanks.,Tony
"Michael, I didn't get a gift bag.",Kevin
"Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.",Michael
My bag's mostly pencils.,Hannah
"Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. [to Tony] All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.",Michael
Can I have your pencils?,Kevin
No.,Hannah
Hi!,Pam
Hi.,Karen
I'm Pam.,Pam
Karen. I love your sweater.,Karen
"Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.",Pam
Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn...,Karen
Welcome.,Michael
...to knit.,Karen
"Welcome, welcome, welcome! [in robot voice] Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.",Michael
"Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?",Karen
"Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?",Michael
"I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.",Andy
Hello.,Andy
Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!,Michael
And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.,Andy
"A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.",Michael
"Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike.",Andy
Oh.,Michael
Nifty!,Andy
They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.,Michael
You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.,Michael
...which is why they need a passing game.,Martin
Right.,Jim
"[to Jim] No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.",Michael
Okay.,Jim
"[to Martin] How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.",Michael
Oh! Thanks.,Martin
"Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. [shakes head] Not... so, your desk is...",Michael
"Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here.",Jim
Oh my god! It's really you!,Pam
"Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...",Jim
I know. I don't care.,Pam
Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.,Jim
It's really good to see you.,Pam
"You, too.",Jim
"Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.",Jim
"Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.",Dwight
"Hey, Dwight.",Jim
Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.,Dwight
Okay. Sounds good.,Jim
What are you doing?,Dwight
I don't know what you're talking about.,Jim
I have a smudge on my forehead?,Dwight
No. Looks good.,Jim
Why are you looking at my forehead?,Dwight
I'm not.,Jim
"Meet my eye line, Jim!",Dwight
I am.,Jim
Stop acting like an idiot!,Dwight
Okay.,Jim
"Hey, buddy. Welcome back.",Ryan
Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.,Jim
I'm good! How are you? So...,Ryan
"Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?",Jim
Yeah.,Ryan
Oh.,Jim
"Um... unless you really, really want it back.",Ryan
"You know, man, it's really you're call.",Jim
"Cool, thank you.",Ryan
[whispers] Let me get that for you.,Jim
Yuh.,Ryan
This one taken? No. Good.,Jim
Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.,Ryan
"Hey, this came with the Stamford book. [Sets down box that says: Personnel Files Stamford CT Office Confidential] Can you take care of it?",Toby
"Oh, yes I can.",Kevin
"In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.",Kevin
"Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.",Andy
Right.,Michael
Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.,Dwight
Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.,Andy
"So you'll be reporting to me, then.",Dwight
"Umm, on the contrary.",Andy
My title has 'Manager' in it.,Dwight
And I'm a director.,Andy
Oh.,Dwight
Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?,Andy
I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.,Dwight
Congratulations.,Andy
"Hey, Toby!",Jim
"Hey, Jim!",Toby
"How are you, man?",Jim
"Oh, really good.",Toby
I just wanted to say hi.,Jim
How are you? Hey. Welcome back. [puts out fist to bump],Toby
Oh. Is that like your new thing?,Jim
"No, I'm sorry, it's...",Toby
No. It's cool.,Jim
"No, it's nothing. We'll just... [shakes hand]",Toby
All right. Good to be back.,Jim
So... okay.,Toby
All right.,Jim
All right... sorry... sorry about that.,Toby
No problem.,Jim
It was just...,Toby
[off camera] ...what?,Jim
Nothing.,Toby
This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] Shoot.,Kevin
[talking to himself] I present the orientation video.,Michael
We need to talk!,Dwight
Not now.,Michael
Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?,Dwight
I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.,Michael
Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?,Dwight
"It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.",Michael
Ok. Who reports to who?,Dwight
"I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?",Michael
And then if I want...,Dwight
Work it out amongst your selves!,Michael
I...,Dwight
"Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?",Michael
I...,Dwight
Will you?,Michael
One...,Dwight
Please?,Michael
Jim!,Kelly
Kelly!,Jim
Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!,Kelly
Really?,Jim
"Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!",Kelly
Great. What's new with you?,Jim
I just told you.,Kelly
"Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please [makes drum roll noises], the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!",Michael
Yoko shack.,Michael
...thank you James. [laughs],Male voice
"Hey, champagne.",Meredith
"Nope, no. Guests only.",Michael
Looks like salmon.,Kelly
"Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.",Michael
I eat beef.,Kelly
"Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.",Michael
The beef is poisoned?,Kevin
"No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please. [talks to group] Welcome. Help yourself.",Michael
Um... You might want these orientation materials.,Toby
"Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.",Michael
"Oh, this looks promising.",Jim
You won't be disappointed.,Pam
Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch 'Lazy Scranton'.,Michael
[Lazy Scranton Video],Video
"Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.",Michael
"Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.",Dwight
So check out how we live,Michael
in the Electric City!,Michael & Dwight
They call it Scranton.,Michael
What?,Dwight
The Electric City. Scranton.,Michael
What?,Dwight
The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.,Michael
But check that it's covered by your health care provider!,Dwight
It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.,Jim
[in video] I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.,Michael
[Lazy Scranton video continues],Video
"You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,",Michael
But the little cars go in the compact spot,Dwight
"Spot, spot, spot, spot ...",Michael and Dwight
[on video in background] Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?,Michael
"Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'.",Michael
[recording phone message] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.,Karen
Terrible. Totally unconvincing.,Jim
[recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.,Karen
"Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.",Jim
[recording] [in bad Italian accent] Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.,Karen
You feel good?,Jim
Mm-hm.,Karen
All right.,Jim
[recording phone message] Karen Filippelli.,Karen
"Hey, buddy. Anything new to report?",Andy
Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.,Dwight
"Sure thing, buddy.",Andy
"Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm.",Andy
"Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver.",Andy
Oh.,Angela
Do you like it?,Andy
"I do like it, actually.",Angela
Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.,Andy
Thank you.,Angela
You're welcome.,Andy
Hey.,Pam
Hey!,Jim
What happened to grape soda?,Pam
Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.,Jim
Oh. You've changed so much.,Pam
"Well, I'm evolving, Pam.",Jim
So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?,Pam
"Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.",Jim
"Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.",Pam
Okay.,Jim
Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...,Michael
Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm...,Jim
All right.,Michael
Don't...,Jim
Okay.,Michael
All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.,Jim
"Yeah. I know, me too.",Pam
All right!,Jim
"The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.",Pam
[using breast pump] Take a picture. It'll last longer.,Hannah
"I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.",Ryan
"Ditto that, my brother.",Creed
Look what's on his computer.,Hannah
What is that? A squid's eye or...,Michael
It's my left breast.,Hannah
How did you...,Michael
Right place at the right time.,Creed
"Uh, what's that smell?",Karen
What smell?,Phyllis
Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.,Karen
"Oh, I'll help you find it.",Phyllis
"Oh, you know. Never... .never mind.",Karen
What is it?,Phyllis
"I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume.",Karen
My perfume?,Phyllis
"It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells.",Karen
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.,Phyllis
Who's Bob Vance?,Karen
"You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.",Phyllis
I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.,Stanley
People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.,Michael
"I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.",Michael
Do you have batteries?,Dwight
Ssshh stupid! Um...,Michael
[sings drum beat intro to 'What is Love?'],Andy
That's it!,Michael
[sings] What is love?,Andy
"Yes, yes! Okay!",Michael
"Baby, don't hurt me.",Andy
"Okay, here we go.",Michael
"Don't hurt me! Baby, don't hurt me!",Andy & Michael
Oh!,Michael
"Baby, don't hurt me!",Andy
Oh! Oh! Oh!,Michael
Whoa-oh-oh-oh,Andy
Scuse me! Scuse me!,Michael
Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Whoa-oh-oh...,Andy & Michael
You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!,Michael
Whoa-oh-oh-oh.,Andy
"You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!",Michael
"Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.",Andy
"[laughs hysterically] Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.",Michael
"Very funny, Michael!",Dwight
Okay! Okay!,Michael
"Really funny, Michael!",Dwight
"All right, all right, I'm on a roll.",Michael
Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.,Michael
Shouldn't we be equals?,Karen
Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.,Michael
"Uh... this is difficult, for me.",Tony
I understand. We're all friends.,Michael
No. I mean I can't physically. I can't get on the table.,Tony
"Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.",Michael
[starts to climb table],Tony
You know what? I'll help. I will...,Michael
"No, please. No.",Tony
Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!,Michael
Do this. Come on. Ready?,Dwight
Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.,Michael
On three. One... two... three.,Dwight
"Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.",Michael
All right. All right. Stop. Put me down.,Tony
We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!,Michael
Let me go!,Tony
I'm right in your crack!,Michael
Put me down right...,Tony
Up and over.,Michael
Put me down!,Tony
Up and over.,Michael
Put me down right now!,Tony
You've got it.,Michael
I'VE HAD ENOUGH!,Tony
"You've got it, you've got it.",Michael
PUT ME DOWN RIGHT NOW or else!,Tony
Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.,Michael
"Hey, hey. Easy.",Dwight
Easy.,Michael
I'm sorry!,Tony
Don't...,Michael
It's just not going to work for me.,Tony
What...,Michael
I have to go.,Tony
I don't understand.,Michael
I was on the fence about this and... it's just not a good fit.,Tony
"Well, we'll squeeze you in.",Michael
I can't work here. I have to quit.,Tony
"You can't quit! On the first day. That's [deep voice] heresy, my friend! [regular voice] Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what?",Michael
No. Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It's just your management style.,Tony
My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?,Michael
No. Was it supposed to be funny?,Tony
"Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.",Michael
Excuse me?,Tony
"You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!",Michael
But there's nothing in my desk except coupons.,Tony
"Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.",Michael
That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.,Dwight
"Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.",Michael
And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.,Dwight
Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.,Andy
Tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional.,Hannah
Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.,Angela
"Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.",Michael
Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.,Stanley
No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.,Michael
"The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.",Michael
"Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.",Michael
What!,Dwight
Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!,Michael
Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration?,Karen
Does he ever.,Jim
"Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.",Michael
YEAH!,Dwight
Yeah.,Michael
I don't... I don't think we can do that.,Toby
"Go home, Toby. Just...",Michael
Hey! Why doesn't your car have a flat tire?,Martin
Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful. [reads note] 'You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!',Michael
For crying out loud.,Hannah
"No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...",Michael
[to Stanley] What's up with this guy?,Martin
Got an hour? I'll try to explain.,Stanley
THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!,Michael
Trust me. It only gets worse.,Stanley
Is he always like this?,Martin
Sometimes he brings more costumes.,Ryan
When do people work?,Hannah
"Oh, we find little times during the day.",Phyllis
How are we going to get home?,Karen
Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.,Phyllis
Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration.,Karen
"See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. [answers phone] Jell-o!",Michael
Michael!,Jan
"Hi, Jan!",Michael
Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?,Jan
I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.,Michael
"Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?",Jan
Yes.,Michael
You do?,Jan
But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.,Michael
"What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.",Jan
What?,Michael
He's the only one who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.,Jan
"Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.",Michael
"So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.",Michael
If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.,Dwight
"Yeah, it does, actually.",Jim
So who will be your new Number Three?,Dwight
Uh... that I have not decided yet.,Michael
"Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.",Andy
"Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks.",Michael
And I have to say your leadership...,Dwight
Shut it...,Michael
has brought...,Dwight
Shut it! That's... [whispers to camera] suck up!,Michael
"[talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?",Jim
[off camera] I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.,Karen
[laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?,Jim
Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.,Karen
Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?,Jim
Yeah.,Karen
"Ok, thanks.",Jim
Ok.,Karen
Hey.,Jim
Hey!,Pam
I thought you had already... left.,Jim
Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.,Pam
Oh... Good.,Jim
What's up?,Pam
"Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.",Jim
What do you mean?,Pam
I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...,Jim
Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.,Pam
O..ok. Um..good.,Jim
We're friends. We'll always be friends.,Pam
Right.,Jim
It's good to have you back.,Pam
Yeah. Good to be back.,Jim
Where'd you get that salad?,Meredith
Staples.,Kevin
"Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?",Andy
"Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.",Dwight
"Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.",Andy
Xterra's not even a real word.,Dwight
"Actually, it is. It's Latin for 'earth.'",Andy
"Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?",Dwight
Yeah.,Andy
That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.,Dwight
"Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.",Andy
Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.,Dwight
"Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.",Andy
"Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.",Dwight
"Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.",Andy
Idiot!,Dwight
"If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm.",Andy
"If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.",Dwight
[coughs word] Idiot!,Andy
[coughs sentence] You're the idiot!,Dwight
[coughs sentence] Nice comeback!,Andy
[coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.,Dwight
"And this is, don't tell me, Martin... Ne... Ne...Nack.",Michael
Nash.,Dwight
Martin Nash. Okay.,Michael
"Male, age 37...",Dwight
Good.,Michael
"Mocha complexion. Supplier relations. Either caught a fish or was standing next to a man who caught a fish in Key West, Florida.",Dwight
What are you talking about?,Michael
[holds up piece of paper] It wasn't clear on the Google Image search.,Dwight
"All right, just...",Michael
"Hey, Kev. How you doing?",Jim
"Hey, man. Good. Listen, my M&M's are under the desk if you want any.",Kevin
Okay.,Jim
Hidden from [whisper] them.,Kevin
"Smart. Good. [to Angela] Hey, Angela.",Jim
You need a hair cut.,Angela
"Bye, Angela. All right, Kev.",Jim
"See you later, Jim.",Kevin
See you later.,Jim
[to Angela] It's his first day back.,Kevin
His hair's flipping out on the sides.,Angela
[smiles] I like it.,Kevin
"Oh, my Lord.",Angela
This is weird with you facing the other way.,Pam
"Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed. [Pam chuckles] Hey, who's that guy? [Jim points to Stanley]",Jim
That's Stanley Hudson.,Pam
Huh.,Jim
He's one of our salesmen.,Pam
Seems like a nice enough guy.,Jim
Oh very.,Pam
"What about, uh.. [points at Meredith]",Jim
"Hmm, that is... Janet Fenstermaker.",Pam
Really?,Jim
[Pam nods head] You should say hi. Use her full name.,Pam
"Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner? [points to Creed]",Jim
"Uh, that is Creed Bratton. He has four toes and he fought in the Civil war.",Pam
For the North.,Jim
For both sides. Whoever paid more.,Pam
Obviously.,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
"Hey, uh sorry. Seriously, can you guys... I'm trying to get some work done.",Ryan
Sorry. Man. [Pam hesitates and then leaves],Jim
Thanks.,Ryan
"Hey, nice thermos.",Karen
[notices Karen has same thermos as herself] Hey. That's funny.,Meredith
Yeah.,Karen
[holds out flask] Do you want a little?,Meredith
"Uh no, I'm fine, thank you.",Karen
"Okay. If you change your mind, you just let me know, okay?",Meredith
"Yeah, I'm okay, thanks.",Karen
That's cool.,Meredith
"[approaching Kevin to shake hand] Hi, Andy Bernard.",Andy
Kevin Malone.,Kevin
Nice to meet you.,Andy
What's that on your shirt? [points to Andy's shirt],Kevin
That is a penguin. You like it?,Andy
The Penguin.,Kevin
"Andy, or Andrew.",Andy
"Okay, Penguin. [laughs]",Kevin
Smiles.,Michael
Yeah.,Andy
"Good, what's funny?",Michael
"Michael, have you met the Penguin?",Kevin
"Oh, nicknames, yay! Penguin power.",Michael
"Ha, that's why I wore this shirt.",Andy
Good.,Michael
"Hey, girls. What's happening? Startinng to blend? Well, before long, you guys keep hanging out, you guys you are gonna share the same menstrual cycle.",Michael
[sniffs. Pans to Creed eating his mungbeans.],Martin
[pushing back desk item] Here you go.,Hannah
That was in your way?,Meredith
Um,Hannah

"Yeah, I mean my stuff's coming over, but umm... is this...is this yours? [holds up travel mug]",Hannah
[takes mug] Yes.,Meredith
Hey Kevin.,Andy
Yeah.,Kevin
Have you lost weight?,Andy
Well... I... Hey. You've never met me before.,Kevin
"I know, but you just give off the vide of a guy who's getting thinner.",Andy
"Well, thanks. I appreciate that.",Kevin
You're welcome.,Andy
"You know who I really like? That guy, Andy.",Kevin
"Can't we all get along? No, we can't. But here's the thing: yes, we can. Well, why not? Because of differeneces. Well, can we overcome these differences? No. Can we find each other and connect with each other in spite of these differences? No, we can't. But, we have to try and that is why I created the Integration Celebration.",Michael
"I need somebody to pick a card. [Dwight raises hand] One of the new people, please? Tony? [Tony walks away]",Michael
[gets up] I'll do it.,Andy
"All right. Good. Thank you. [Andy picks a card] Do not look at your card. Now, I've always said that to be a great salesman is to have the ability to connect with people right here [puts hand over heart]. So to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts. Turn over your card.",Michael
[turns over card] King of hearts.,Andy
[starts clapping] Very good Michael. Really good. [Michael shushes Dwight],Dwight
So I think in order for us all to work together well we must come together as a family and then we can all be [starts to fan out the rest of his cards facing the group showing kings of hearts] a king of hearts.,Michael
[claps] That was fantastic.,Andy
"[clapping] No, no, it's better than fantastic. It's super perfect.",Dwight
"Dwight, don't, don't be a suck up.",Michael
What I want all of you [points at Scranton branch] to do is approach one of the new people and tell them the one thing that you like most about them. Who wants to start? Who wants to give it a shot?,Michael
[raises hand] I want to.,Meredith
"Okay Meredith, let's give it a shot.",Michael
[to Martin] I love your complexion. It's like devil's food cake.,Meredith
Thank you.,Martin
"[clapping] Beautiful. Very good, nice.",Michael
"It just goes to show you, you play with fire and you are gonna singe your eyebrows. And they do not grow back the same way. [takes of glasses and points to right eyebrow]",Dwight
It is inspiring to me to watch you navigate these murky waters.,Andy
Okay.,Michael
Bull... [bleep] [clears throat] Sorry.,Dwight
We heard it.,Michael
Yeah.,Jim
We heard what you said. You didn't cover it at all.,Michael
I had a tickle in my throat.,Dwight
"[points at camera] They're gonna have... You can't say that, all right?",Michael
I can't say [clearinng throat noise]?,Dwight
[clearing throat noise] Idiot. Dwight's an idiot! Did you catch that or did... did the cough cover it?,Michael
Sometimes it hurts Michael.,Dwight
[cleaing throat] You're a jerk. Dwight's a jerk!,Michael
Ohhhh! She's absolutely adorable!,Pam
He.,Hannah
"...Oh, sorry. He's--he's dressed all in pink.",Pam
That's his favorite color.,Hannah
...Oh. That's... fun for him.,Pam
Fantastic.,Stanley
"Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute.",Michael
Thank youuu.,Hannah
Ohh. May I?,Michael
"Uh, sure!",Hannah
"[climbs under desk] Hey, look at me, I'm a baby! I'm one of those babies from 'Look Who's Talking.' What am I thinking? [Laughs] Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts.",Michael
Hey.,Karen
Hey.,Jim
...Almost done?,Karen
Just about... yup. Now.,Jim
"Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.",Jim
"Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know.",Michael
"Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting.",Angela
[over phone] Mmhmm.,Jan
"Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.",Angela
We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.,Jan
I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist. [Jan sighs] ... I'm just kidding.,Michael
When did the check come?,Jan
Last week.,Angela
"Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.",Jan
One of the Stamford people is a criminal?,Angela
"Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.",Michael
"Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?",Angela
"Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.",Jan
[whispering] Who is it?,Pam
Hannah?,Michael
Hmm.,Kevin
Hmm.,Angela
Andy.,Kevin
Andy?,Angela
Hmm. Martin?,Kevin
Kuhhhh... you are such a racist.,Michael
"Wait, why am I a racist?",Kevin
Because you think he's black.,Michael
He is black... right? And...,Kevin
Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.,Michael
...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash.,Jan
Yeah!,Kevin
Michael?,Jan
Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake.,Michael
I wonder what he did.,Kevin
"In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.",Michael
Why would anyone go to jail for that?,Pam
"Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.",Michael
Cool.,Kevin
Okay. Angela?,Pam
"Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.",Angela
Good. All right. [everyone leaves],Michael
[picks up phone] Jim Halpert.,Jim
[over phone] I am so horny.,Andy
...Okay I can't... help you... with that.,Jim
"Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack.",Andy
"She is dating Ryan, I think.",Jim
"Oh, and I care why?",Andy
She's... high-maintenance.,Jim
"Next. How about... [motions toward Angela]. Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that.",Andy
"Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.",Jim
"Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?",Andy
...Absolutely you should.,Jim
Jackpot.,Andy
Just... try to be cool.,Michael
I am cool.,Dwight
"Okay, are you cool, really?",Michael
"I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on.",Dwight
"Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. [Dwight starts to run] No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!",Michael
"I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.",Dwight
"All... righty, let's get started. What is she into?",Andy
"I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...",Jim
Frisbee-based competitions...,Jim
Are you kidding?,Andy
She...,Jim
I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.,Andy
"Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?",Jim
"Hey Martin, how's it going?",Michael
"Good. Getting settled, you know?",Martin
"Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.",Michael
My dad.,Pam
...Danny Glover. [Jim raises hand] Yeah.,Michael
Jonas Salk.,Jim
Who?,Michael
Justin Timberlake?,Jim
Oh. Please. Colin Powell.,Michael
Hey I got one.,Karen
Yup.,Michael
Jesus.,Karen
Apollo Creed.,Michael
"Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you.",Michael
So... you all wanna know what I was in for?,Martin
No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them.,Michael
"Um, I really don't mind. It was a stupid mistake. I was working in finance and, I... got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink.",Martin
[laughs] That is awesome.,Michael
"I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.",Kevin
What was prison like?,Pam
Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But... at least we got outdoors time.,Martin
You got outdoors time?,Kevin
"Two hours, every day. Sometimes we'd play pickup football games...",Martin
"Michael, why don't we get outdoors time?",Kevin
"Yeah, some days I never go outside.",Pam
"Well, we are running a business, so.",Michael
What was your cell like?,Meredith
"Not good. Uh... a little bit bigger than Michael's office... but, you know, I really only slept there. You know, during the day, there-our time's our own. They had uh, classes, I took some... watercolor classes.",Martin
They have art classes?,Pam
Yeap. Yeah.,Martin
They have business classes there?,Ryan
"They did, taught by some uh, Harvard business school guys--a lot of the guys also, that were in the class, the inmates, a lot of them have gone on to do extraordinary things in business.",Martin
Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin.,Pam
Ah. Well. That's not true.,Michael
I would so rather be in prison.,Kevin
Prison sounds great.,Ryan
No you would not.,Michael
This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison.,Michael
[singsong voice] Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this?,Creed
You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow.,Karen
"Oh, it's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo?",Creed
"Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around. Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay?",Andy
Wow... I--,Pam
Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back.,Andy
Wow. That was... wow.,Pam
"Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go!",Michael
"Michael, it's freezing out.",Pam
I can't feel my toes.,Phyllis
Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up?,Michael
"What is that, like... five pounds?",Jim
"It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone.",Michael
I'm going back inside.,Stanley
"Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time.",Michael
Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint?,Michael
"Yeah, in the rec room.",Martin
Ah. A ten inch black and white?,Michael
"Actually, our TV was bigger than that one.",Martin
These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.,Michael
Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.,Jim
Yeah.,Andy
Quick question - do you play the guitar?,Jim
I play the banjo.,Andy
"Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?",Jim
"[singing] You know I can, my man.",Andy
Yup. That's perfect.,Jim
Hey.,Karen
Hey.,Jim
I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car.,Andy
Perfect.,Jim
What is going on?,Karen
...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.,Jim
I love it. I want in. Who's the target?,Karen
"...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...",Jim
Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment.,Karen
"Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else.",Jim
"All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say 'Boo' because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like [puts on bandanna]. I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!",Michael
Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?,Angela
"Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?! [employees protest] All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you. [points to Ryan] You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap!",Michael
"Michael, please. [Michael makes kissing noises]",Ryan
Where... did you learn all of this?,Jim
Internet.,Michael
"So, not prison.",Jim
"And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.",Michael
"What'd you do, Prison Mike?",Jim
I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.,Michael
"That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.",Jim
"And I nevah got caught, neither.",Michael
"Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm.",Jim
Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?,Pam
"Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.",Michael
Wow. Prison sounds horrible.,Andy
"Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.",Michael
Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?,Dwight
"Don't encourage him, Dwight.",Angela
"The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!",Michael
Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter?,Karen
"No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life. [turns around, takes bandanna off] So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it?",Michael
"Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.",Pam
"Yeah, that... wasn't really... at all my experience. There were certain elements of what you performed, I've seen on television. But it didn't remind me of my time in prison.",Martin
"Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. [locks employees in conference room]",Michael
"Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.",Jim
"No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas.",Michael
[knocking on door] Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--,Kevin
Shh!,Hannah
[answering phone] This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from?,Toby
Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room?,Toby
"They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.",Michael
"Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will.",Toby
"Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.",Michael
"You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny.",Toby
"[unlocks door] Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!",Michael
"Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black.",Michael
"[singing] So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee...",Andy
Merry Christmas! [holds up dead goose and puts it on Pam's desk],Dwight
Merry Christ--[looks up] NO! Why... why did you bring that here?,Pam
"Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead.",Dwight
"Dwight, what uh...",Pam
I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!,Dwight
"Well, get it out of here.",Pam
"Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?",Dwight
Merry Christmas Dwight.,Jim
Jim.,Dwight
Wow. What have we got here?,Jim
What does it look like?,Dwight
Dead goose.,Jim
And circle gets the square.,Dwight
All right.,Jim
[to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.,Dwight
"Oh, Dwight, we talked about this.",Toby
"No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.",Dwight
"Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.",Dwight
"He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.",Dwight
Wow. Win-Win.,Jim
"Exactly. Thank you, Jim.",Dwight
I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?,Phyllis
That's crazy. It's crazy.,Creed
"Dwight, you cannot keep that here.",Toby
"Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.",Dwight
"Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.",Toby
It's Christmas Toby.,Dwight
It's a dead animal in an office. You can't...,Toby
Toby...,Dwight
I'm sorry.,Toby
[sighs] Please? Please?,Dwight
Clean it in your car.,Toby
I would like it off my desk.,Pam
Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.,Dwight
"[Riding a bicycle down the hallway and singing] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la. [Struggling to stay on] 'Tis the ... ack. [expletive] Hey! [to Pam] I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint...",Michael
"Can I help you, Michael?",Pam
I'm looking for the toy drive box.,Michael
It's behind you.,Pam
"OK... Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks.",Michael
Wow. What kind of bike is that?,Jim
Umm... I don't know? Average kind?,Michael
The tires look pretty worn.,Kevin
"Well, that is probably from the test drive.",Michael
"But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?",Jim
No.,Michael
"Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike.",Andy
"Oh, thanks. [Michael and Andy do a fist bump and explosion.]",Michael
Michael?,Pam
"Yes? [Pam holds up a bag] Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that.",Michael
"[hands over bag] I didn't, it's from corporate.",Pam
OK. Did everybody get one of these?,Michael
Yup.,Pam
Terrific. Good.,Michael
"This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her. [singing] I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um, taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.",Michael
"[Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy",Jim
And a happy holiday to you.,Creed
[Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol.,Jim
"Hi, is Michael around here?",Carol
There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello [kisses Carol] You're about five hours early to the party. You're such a blonde. [laughs],Michael
Michael.,Carol
"Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side.",Michael
[whispers] What?,Carol
"Turn around, turn around. Come on. [making a body turning gesture]",Michael
Get outta here.,Carol
"No, you get outta here.",Michael
Michael,Andy
Yes.,Michael
If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her.,Andy
"[standing up] Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.",Dwight
Thank you.,Michael
I really need a moment alone with you. [Carol heads towards Michael's office.],Carol
Not as much as I need a moment alone with you. [puts finger on her back and reaches for her butt] Berp.,Michael
What is this? [Holds up a Christmas photo],Carol
"That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.",Michael
"No. See, we never went on a ski trip.",Carol
I know.,Michael
I went on a ski trip.,Carol
Right.,Michael
Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband.,Carol
"Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...",Michael
Michael.,Carol
And next to your kids. What?,Michael
This is so weird.,Carol
I don't understand?,Michael
"It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?",Jim
I think you're a really sweet guy.,Carol
OK,Michael
"But, um, I don't know how to deal with, with this thing [waves Christmas card]. And, and the proposal. And I don't think things are going to work out with us.",Carol
"No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in [making drum noise] Jamaica's largest fresh water pool.",Michael
What are you talking about?,Carol
"I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. [Carol shakes head in disappointment]. You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.",Michael
"Oh, no. Michael.",Carol
And it's all inclusive.,Michael
Michael...,Carol
Yes.,Michael
I'm sorry.,Carol
"No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.",Michael
I know. [Closes door.],Carol
"Psst. Jim. [Jim turns around. Pam nods head towards her for him to come over] Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you.",Pam
What?,Jim
For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim],Pam
Are you serious?,Jim
"They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell.",Pam
"[Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.",Jim
So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. [Jim smiles] Sorry I didn't wrap it.,Pam
"[closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?",Jim
Oh.,Pam
"No, because of the promotion.",Jim
Oh yeah.,Pam
"It just feels a little bit, like...",Jim
"No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.]",Pam
"I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?",Jim
I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled.,Michael
You can't cancel a holiday.,Stanley
Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's.,Michael
What does that mean?,Stanley
"Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley.",Michael
"Michael, what's going on?",Pam
Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.,Michael
Will they still air 'Rudolph?',Jim
That's not fair.,Kevin
[over everybody else's talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?,Dwight
Fine! [everybody stops talking] Have your party. Just no guests.,Michael
But we invited guests.,Phyllis
"Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.",Michael
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.",Michael
I know.,Pam
It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.,Michael
"OK, well, why are you laying like that?",Pam
[moves a little] Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?,Michael
Like what?,Pam
"Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?",Michael
"Well.. um I, I don't...",Pam
And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?,Michael
I don't need to know.,Pam
"Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.",Dwight
Take it from Toby.,Michael
Copy.,Dwight
"Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?",Michael
"No, thank you.",Pam
It's all... [Pam walks away.] OK.,Michael
Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- [Dwight grabs bag with robe in it and walks away.] Why?,Toby
"Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.",Angela
I thought you said green was whorish.,Phyllis
"No, orange is whorish.",Angela
"Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... [Phyllis and Pam nod their heads in agreement].",Karen
It would never work here.,Angela
"Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ...",Karen
No.,Angela
A Christmas drinking game ...,Karen
Yes.,Meredith
God help you.,Angela
What?,Karen
These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of 'A Nutcracker Christmas.' I think you should leave.,Angela
You're kidding.,Karen
"You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]",Angela
What are you doing? ['Goodbye My Lover' by James Blunt plays],Michael
[putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.,Dwight
"Hey, what's the haps? [Dwight shuts door in his face.]",Andy
Carol?,Michael
"Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to 'Goodbye My Lover' on computer]",Dwight
Why don't you just buy the whole song?,Dwight
I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.,Michael
"Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.",Dwight
[singing] Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. [hits repeat again],Michael
"This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.",Michael
"I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her.",Pam
"Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.",Pam
"Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go.",Karen
"Um, usually like that.",Pam
Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..?,Karen
I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh],Pam
Right.,Karen
"Um, I really liked your karaoke idea.",Pam
"Oh cool, yeah.",Karen
That could really be fun.,Pam
"Oh, thank you.",Karen
You guys do a raffle?,Pam
"Yeah, we do a raffle...",Karen
Hey Kev.,Toby
"Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin's back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.]",Kevin
This should've been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer],Angela
It'll be all right.,Phyllis
[Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The 'Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?' There's no such thing as the 'Committee to Plan Parties.',Angela
There is now. We just started it.,Pam
"Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding.",Angela
What's your funding?,Karen
Two hundred dollars.,Angela
What's ours again?,Pam
"Umm, two hundred and one dollars.",Karen
Oh right.,Pam
"[pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.",Kelly
"No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock.",Angela
Then why are there two flyers?,Kevin
"Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three.",Karen
Right.,Kevin
And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.,Karen
"Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela's flyer.]",Pam
I didn't see where it was.,Kevin
"Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?",Jim
I think that's a really good option...,Karen
Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.,Dwight
You can't do that.,Pam
"As ranking number three in this office, I am order -",Dwight
Umm... I'm number three.,Andy
You're number four.,Dwight
"Yeah, but I'm number three.",Andy
"Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.",Dwight
"OK, I think I can help here.",Jim
"Ok, good",Dwight
"As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.",Jim
"OK, this is stupid.",Dwight
Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.],Jim
"No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee.",Dwight
Permission denied.,Jim
Damn it!,Dwight
"Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. [Michael sighs.] C'mon, my treat.",Andy
All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.,Michael
"That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too.",Andy
Hooters?,Michael
"No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too. [do a fist bump and explosion]",Andy
"Ah, I need my entourage [both exit Michael's office] Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters.",Michael
"Ah man, I can't.",Ryan
Why not?,Michael
"I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan's forehead]",Ryan
"Ok, feel better.",Michael
Thanks.,Ryan
"C'mon Jim, let's go.",Michael
"OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.",Jim
"Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.",Ryan
Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'.,Michael
"So she looks really hot, so I said, 'You look hotter than usual today.' [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table.",Andy
"Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um... [to two other people at the table] Sir, I'm going to need take this chair.",Dwight
"Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy.",Michael
"So she looks at me right, and she goes, 'I'm sorry, don't I even know you?' After a year, a",Andy
Yes.,Jim
I can't... I can't here what you're saying.,Dwight
Carol used to drink lattes.,Michael
[off screen at other end of table] What're you talking about?,Dwight
She would get this little foam mustache...,Michael
[still off screen] Carol had a mustache?,Dwight
"And I used to say 'Hey, got latte?' And she'd say, that's not funny.",Michael
[off screen] What are you guys talking about?,Dwight
She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy ---,Michael
Michael! Repeat what you said louder!,Dwight
It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight's face],Dwight
"I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out...",Michael
No.,Andy
Who are you calling?,Dwight
I'm just gonna call her.,Michael
"Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here, [to waitress] we need your help.",Andy
What can I get for 'ya?,Waitress
I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes. [waitress gives confused look],Andy
"One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.",Andy
"You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas]",Phyllis
That's a great idea.,Pam
Phyllis?,Angela
I was just getting a snack.,Phyllis
You can have your snack in here.,Pam
"Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.",Angela
OK.,Phyllis
"I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.",Kevin
I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.,Ryan
So I only use three?,Roy
"If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong.",Pam
OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?,Roy
"Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.",Pam
"OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?",Roy
"Oh yeah, your mom would love that.",Pam
"[Karen walks in] Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later. [leaves room]",Roy
Bye.,Pam
He's cute. You should date him.,Karen
"Oh, yeah... Maybe.",Pam
Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.,Dwight
"No, it's Usuba.",Chef
"Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.",Dwight
"Actually, the Usuba's the better knife when you're working with this quantity.",Chef
"Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better.",Dwight
I think he'd know. [Dwight and her stare at each other],Woman at bar
Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.,Michael
"Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?",Andy
I don't know.,Cindy
"Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. [Cindy laughs and walks away]",Michael
"You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. [referring to what chef is doing] Watch, watch, watch, watch. [Onions smoke up] Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya?",Andy
You're right. That's good.,Michael
Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .,Pam
I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside],Angela
[on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?,Angela
"Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention]",Dwight
This drink... [in audible conversation with Michael],Andy
I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.,Michael
Did Michael give you permission to do this?,Angela
[with conviction] Start the party.,Dwight
"[Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.]",Angela
Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.],Pam
Yup.,Karen
[Stanley gets up and walks towards the break room.] All right Stanley. Woo.,Karen
Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.],Pam
Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.,Angela
Why would I be disappointed?,Hannah
I said you wouldn't be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.],Angela
"Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.",Angela
Is that a threat?,Meredith
"No, it's an invitation.",Angela
We have vodka!,Pam
Lots of it! [Meredith leaves to break room party.],Karen
I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm...,Kevin
Brownies. Cupcakes. [Kevin walks toward conference room],Angela
Don't push it.,Kevin
"Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. [Pam and Karen look at each other] What?",Karen
I got goose bumps.,Pam
"I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good.",Angela
"Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. [points to chef] Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. [leans over to neighboring man's plate] I see steak.",Michael
Excuse me.,Man
"Excuse me [tries to take away meat with chopsticks] Ah, un guard. [Fights with chopsticks and laughs] Family style.",Michael
"No, it's not.",Jim
"Cindy, Cindy.",Andy
I don't think... I love it!,Michael
"I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. [Cindy laughs] C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day.",Andy
[laughing] I don't know what he's doing.,Michael
This is great.,Andy
Jim! Jim! What... What's happening?,Dwight
"Oh, [points to Cindy] she's asleep.",Jim
Oh... Narcolepsy.,Dwight
Probably.,Jim
Now open your eyes and describe it to me.,Andy
"I... don't know, it has four bed rooms and a loft...",Cindy
"Oh my gosh, now she's up.",Dwight
"And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.",Jim
"Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.",Dwight
"Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.",Jim
What d'ya think? [to Stanley about his drink],Kelly
Fruity and delicious.,Stanley
"See, I told you. You want one Meredith?",Kelly
No thanks. They're too sweet.,Meredith
"Hey, so what's the status.",Karen
Looks like they forgot the power cord.,Ryan
What?,Pam
"Oh, you're kidding me?",Karen
No.,Ryan
"Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine. [everyone sighs]",Karen
Well that blows.,Kelly
"Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer. [Everyone cheers]",Darryl
Darryl! Darryl! Darryl! [Darryl exits break room and passes Phyllis],Everybody
Hi.,Phyllis
"Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... [looks inside conference room] meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party.",Darryl
"Oh, ok.",Phyllis
All right. Se you later...,Darryl
[tries to break nut on a Nutcracker doll] These nuts are really hard to crack.,Hannah
Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.,Angela
You've got to be kidding!,Kevin
You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie],Angela
"Cold, huh?",Phyllis
Huh? [puts on jacket],Ryan
Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there?,Phyllis
"[referring to waitresses] They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!",Andy
You know what we should do?,Michael
What?,Andy
We should invite them to the Christmas party.,Michael
"Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.",Andy
"Oh, you are such mench my friend. [They stand up and do fist bump and explosion]",Michael
"OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. [Guys walk in with two different waitresses from Benihana's]",Michael
"I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.",Jim
The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.,Michael
That rocks.,Second Cindy
"Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours.",Michael
"Thanks! I, I wanna give you something.",Second Cindy
Oh. [She whispers in his ear. Michael starts to laugh] That's what she said.,Michael
Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.,Michael
My new girlfriend.,Andy
Where's Dwight?,Angela
Is he the hot one or the giant baby?,Second Cindy
"[whispers] The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.",Michael
[under her breath] There's another party in the break room.,Phyllis
"Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room.",Michael
"Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table]",Angela
I thought I could have it.,Second Cindy
You can't have it [takes back toy] I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.,Angela
Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.,Michael
"Hey! It's Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey!",Dwight
We're going to ...,Michael
[singing] I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...,Kevin
"I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos. [turns to reach for pretzel while Second Cindy turns other direction] And... my question to you [points and pulls away other waitress] is do you agree?",Michael
Do I agree about what?,Other waitress
Do you agree about what? [laughs] Wow. You're lucky you're so darn cute.,Michael
What're you talking about?,Other waitress
What're you talking about?,Michael
"[singing] And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.",Kevin
All right [high fives Kevin],Jim
Did you have fun at Benihana's?,Angela
No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party],Dwight
I've had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela's hand],Angela
"[Karen and Pam enter] Dwight, you won the raffle! [holds out gift]",Karen
No... way! Yeah!,Dwight
Open it! Open it ! Open it! [Dwight rips open present. Angela is upset and Pam notices],Karen
Oh.,Dwight
Do you like it?,Karen
Walkie-talkies.,Dwight
Can I talk to you a second?,Pam
Yes!,Dwight
Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.,Karen
[holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.,Pam
"Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties.",Karen
I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?,Angela
"Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.",Pam
"Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one?",Angela
Mmm. Hmm.,Pam
"Yeah, thanks.",Karen
We'll go tell everyone.,Pam
OK.,Karen
"[singing] And if you want love, we'll make it. Swim in a big sea of blankets. Take all your big plans and break 'em. This is bound to take awhile. Your body is a wonderland. [Michael notices Cindy ride up to him on the bike and looks confused] Your body is a wonderland.",Andy and Michael
Your hands.,Andy
Your body is a wonderland.,Both
I'll use my hands on it.,Andy
Something 'bout the way your hair falls in your face...,Both
"[singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan...",Kelly
"When you know, you just know.",Michael
Right.,Kevin
Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.,Michael
Which one is she? [Michael stares at both waitresses],Roy
It's... it's one of those two. [points at both],Michael
You don't know?,Roy
"Dude, you should know.",Kevin
"Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.",Michael
I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like?,Michael
"Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her.",Michael
You know where I am.,Second Cindy
"Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile [marks Cindy's arm with a black marker]",Michael
Oh.,Second Cindy
"Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party.",Michael
"[singing] Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya...",Creed
"[into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?",Dwight
"[into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What's your twenty?",Angela
No way. [both hold up Bridget Jones' Diary movie DVD],Karen
"What a horrible, horrible movie that was.",Jim
And now we get to remember it forever.,Karen
Thank you.,Jim
Thank you. [Both hug],Karen
Hey.,Second Cindy
"Hey, hey, you. How are ya?",Michael
"Hey. This party blows, so we're gonna leave.",Second Cindy
"No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and...",Michael
Cool...,Second Cindy
Where do you wanna go?,Michael
I... We're just gonna take off.,Second Cindy
"I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.",Michael
No... I have school. [leaves with other waitress and bicycle],Second Cindy
You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.,Michael
Merry Christmas.,Second Cindy
"[singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...",Dwight
That waitress was the one.,Michael
No. She wasn't.,Jim
How can you be sure?,Michael
"Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.",Jim
Don't make fun... You're making fun of me.,Michael
Sorry.,Jim
"I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm.",Michael
You what?,Jim
"I, I put a mark on her arm. [Both are laughing] So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!",Michael
Yeah.,Jim
"Oh, why do I feel like crap?",Michael
You just had a rebound.,Jim
I had rebound? Yeah.,Michael
"Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.",Jim
"I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.",Michael
"[singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..",Angela
"[on phone] Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive...",Michael
"[singing] ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door]",Angela
Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out],Oscar
"[singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.",Angela
[singing along] pum pum pum pum pum pum pum,Dwight
Bye Pam.,Dwight
Night.,Pam
"[to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.",Jim
We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier.,Pam
"Oh no, that would be great.",Jim
It costs seventy five dollars.,Pam
"Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?",Jim
Ohh... [laughs],Pam
[Cell phone beeps] What the? [Reading text message] 'You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.' Destroy phone? [Dwight throws phone off of the roof and walks away],Dwight
"William Randolph Shakespeare once wrote in one of his plays, and I'm paraphrasing here, 'Love doth be poison.' Brilliant. And a lot of people don't give Shakespeare enough credit. They think it was somebody else. A-holes.",Michael
"When Michael suggested canceling Christmas, I was outraged, not on my behalf, but on behalf of baby Jesus. I mean, would he cancel Christmas because he got dumped or he was two weeks behind on his party planning, on top of the fact that his cats were ill? I think not. I think baby Jesus would suck it up and plan his party.",Angela
"We didn't have a party planning committee in Stamford. Somebody would just volunteer to run out to Carvel and pick up an ice cream cake. So the fact that they have a committee here, fascinating.",Karen
"This is ridiculous. I... I've spent so much time, like I always do. And for that little trollop to come in here and throw her own party... Are you even listening to me?",Angela
"Angela, what do you want me to do?",Toby
"I want you to tell her to stop, Toby. Am I being clear?",Angela
"[sighing] Look, it's a free country. If she wants to throw a party...",Toby
What are you...?,Angela
...using her own money...,Toby
And what...,Angela
...then she should be allowed to.,Toby
No she shouldn't.,Angela
The more the merrier.,Toby
[Angela slaps Toby on the face.] Stop it.,Angela
Oww.,Toby
"I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention to hurt you, but I want to wake you up to the injustice that's going on right in front of your face.",Angela
"That really hurt. I'm writing you up. [Angela makes an angry face] Hey, you are not allowed to touch other employees. Am I being clear?",Toby
Michael was so right about you. You are pathetic.,Angela
"I don't care which party I go to. Once you've danced naked at a hash bonfire with the spirits of the dead, all parties seem pretty much the same.",Creed
"I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.",Kevin
Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars?,Phyllis
They're Sugarplum fairy wands.,Angela
Sugarplum fairy wands.,Phyllis
It's like you weren't even at the meeting.,Angela
"I'm going to the party in the break room, because they have more chairs in there. If I have to stand around a long time, I get real unpleasant to be around.",Stanley
[Phyllis puts down phone] Hmm hmm. [Phyllis gets up and goes to Angela's party],Angela
"No, no, no, no. You know what, I better hold off. I wanna make sure I don't dial Carol before I get drunk.",Michael
"So, really, you're just calling her?",Jim
Yeah. You know what? I am. I'm gonna call her. That's a good idea.,Michael
[from across the table] Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?,Dwight
"[on [phone] No, I don't think I'm asking too much. I think it's only fair that you tell me exactly what I did wrong. Okay. Uh huh. Well that... yeah. Uh huh. All right. Well, could you tell me something that I did",Michael
[knocks on office wall] Hey.,Ryan
"Hello, Ryan.",Kelly
Merry Christmas. [hands over a gift],Ryan
"Oh, thank you. Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends?",Kelly
"Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem?",Ryan
"Well, I didn't get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I'm not gonna stand for that anymore.",Kelly
Um That's... That's fair. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. [Ryan starts walking away.],Ryan
"[runnning after him] Wait, Ryan, you're not mean. You're adorable. I'm so sorry. I got you a present, too. But then when I got to work, I didn't see anything on my desk from you, so I threw it away. And then Asuncion took the trash out, that's why I think it's in the dumpster. I'm so sorry. I'm the worst. [Kelly hugs Ryan]",Kelly
There's no fizz in this punch. Phyllis!,Angela
I'll just go get a ginger ale.,Phyllis
"No, I've got it, Phyllis. Stay. Have fun. Eat your wand.",Angela
"[talking to Kelly in dumpster] Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too.",Ryan
"[from inside dumpster] No, you paid money for that CD.",Kelly
I'm serious. It'll show that we don't care about material things.,Ryan
I don't understand.,Kelly
"Kelly, I'm so cold!",Ryan
[starts to cry] You don't have to scream at me.,Kelly
Are you having fun in this relationship?,Ryan
Sometimes.,Kelly
"I don't know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think...",Ryan
[crying] Don't dump me while I'm in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you're so cold. I'll just stay in the dumpster. [Ryan smirks],Kelly
[both inside dumpster] Did you look over here?,Ryan
Who's eating all these apples?,Kelly
Kelly.,Ryan
And what are these? Are... Why are there egg yolks in here? Aren't you supposed to eat the yolks?,Kelly
Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He's so weird.,Ryan
Do you think I should diet?,Kelly
"No, you're perfect. [Kelly gasps] What? Did you find it?",Ryan
"No, I'm scared.",Kelly
All of a sudden?,Ryan
Uh huh. Hold me.,Kelly
"Oh, honey, here's Stanley.",Michael
Hi.,Second Cindy
"He is also in an interracial relationship, so, you know, if you have any problems, you can always call him.",Michael
"Oh, you're gonna face far greater problems than I can possibly help you with.",Stanley
"Sounds good. Okay, let's go.",Michael
"All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this?",Jim
Tape recorder.,Dwight
For what?,Jim
For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.,Dwight
"OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?",Jim
"Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment.",Karen
"Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?",Jim
What?,Dwight
You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.,Jim
I'm not.,Dwight
"Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!",Jim
I do not have a knife!,Dwight
"No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!",Jim
[leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!,Dwight
[picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.,Jim
Give me it. I am not.,Dwight
"Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...",Phyllis
"Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.",Dwight
"Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?",Karen
"Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.",Jim
You can't see... You can't see my stomach.,Dwight
I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in!,Andy
"Hey, mon!",Michael
Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.,Pam
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.",Michael
OK.,Pam
"Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later.",Michael
It's kind of serious.,Pam
Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.,Michael
How was Jamaica?,Pam
It was,Michael
"Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here.",Stanley
"Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.",Michael
My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.,Stanley
"OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.",Michael
They said I should talk to you.,Stanley
"Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna...",Michael
I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.,Stanley
You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon.,Michael
You want to talk about it?,Jim
Nope.,Karen
"I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a 'for rent' sign down the street from Jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away.",Karen
"Feelin' hot, hot, hot! [playing conch shell] Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing.",Michael
That's good. [Michael continues to play conch shell],Pam
"You know, I had never been out of the country before now?",Michael
Huh.,Pam
"Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.",Michael
It's kind of an impoverished country.,Pam
"Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.",Michael
"But you can't today, we're doing inventory.",Pam
Inventory's at the end of December.,Michael
"We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.",Pam
I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.,Michael
"Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?",Michael
"Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.",Michael
By the end of the day? That's impossible.,Angela
The Jamaicans don't have a word for 'impossible.',Michael
"Yep, it's English, it's 'impossible.'",Jim
"Michael, there's no way we can do it in time.",Angela
"How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need.",Michael
"Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? [points to a TV monitor of a picture from Jamaica and reads] 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem.' This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.",Michael
Oh my God. Is that Jan? [points to same monitor],Pam
What? Where?,Everybody
On the left.,Pam
"Oh yeah, oh my God.",Everybody
"No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue.",Michael
"Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan.",Michael
[on phone] Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.,Michael
Big whoop! I was in Hot-lanta. That whole town is whacked.,Packer
"Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.",Michael
You took the ice queen? I don't buy it.,Packer
"Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim.",Michael
They wouldn't give you a subscription to Maxim.,Packer
Oh no?,Michael
No.,Packer
"OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?",Michael
"Well, no. I got nothing.",Packer
Check it again. Hit refresh.,Michael
"Yeah, Mike, still nothing.",Packer
"OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at... [reading computer screen] Packer@DunderMifflin.com.",Michael
"Wait, I just got it from somebody else. Wow. This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture?",Packer
Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Where's Darryl?,Michael
He's in the office.,Roy
"OK, Hey, man, how's it going?",Michael
"All right, what's up Mike?",Darryl
"That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?",Michael
Yup.,Darryl
"OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not 'packaging.' Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?",Michael
Uh huh.,Darryl
"OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.",Michael
Yup.,Darryl
And you sent that out to everyone?,Michael
"Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken]",Darryl
Yikes.,Jim
Already sent it to you my friend.,Kevin
Fantastic.,Jim
Boring. Call me if she rolls over.,Andy
Hey.,Pam
Hey.,Jim
You OK?,Pam
Yeah.,Jim
You sure?,Pam
"Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.",Jim
Oh. You want to talk about it?,Pam
Really?,Jim
I have a special assignment for you.,Michael
Who's the target?,Dwight
"A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is 'Jamaican Jan Sun Princess.'",Michael
What's it of?,Dwight
Not important.,Michael
"Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.",Dwight
"OK, forget it.",Michael
"OK, I accept it.",Dwight
"So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.",Jim
Hmm.,Pam
"Hmm, what?",Jim
"How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?",Pam
"Yeah, I guess.",Jim
"Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.",Pam
"No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.",Pam
"Hey, thanks a lot.",Jim
"Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!",Pam
"Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]",Jim
Hey I need to talk to you right now.,Toby
"Not now, not ever.",Michael
About you and Jan.,Toby
"Aww, none of your business.",Michael
"Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you've entered into an intimate relationship.",Toby
"That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.",Michael
"Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we don't talk now.",Toby
This is probably the icebreaker you need.,Michael
"You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.",Toby
"I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv.",Michael
"All right, if you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it.",Toby
"No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?",Michael
"All right, thanks Michael.",Toby
OK.,Michael
"OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping.",Angela
What are the ingredients of poi?,Karen
"I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.",Phyllis
Did you try the petting zoo?,Angela
"[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you.",Pam
"Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.",Michael
"He'll call you back. OK, great.",Pam
She bought it? [Pam nods] OK. OK.,Michael
[to Jim and Ryan] Michael hit a deer?,Dwight
Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael's office] There's an emergency in the warehouse.,Dwight
There an accident? Somebody hurt?,Michael
"No, it's... involves the photograph.",Dwight
"Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no.",Michael
"[starts clapping] Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done.",Roy
All right. [continued clapping and cheering for Michael],Michael
"That corporate booty, he likes to hit it!",Roy
"Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman---",Michael
Jan.,Kevin
"No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe...",Michael
Urkel Grue.,Jim
"My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?",Michael
"Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot! [plays conch shell]",Michael
Hey.,Pam
Hey.,Michael
What are you doing out here?,Pam
Island living. You know?,Michael
Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.,Pam
Did she say what it's about?,Michael
That's all she said.,Pam
Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot [playing conch shell],Andy
"Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]",Jim
You sure?,Karen
Definitely.,Jim
I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.,Dwight
There are copies in the bathroom?,Michael
There were. A lot of them.,Dwight
All right.,Michael
I think I owe you one.,Karen
Sorry?,Pam
For talking sense into Halpert. The Day's Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing.,Karen
"Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.",Pam
"Yeah, but... thanks. Seriously.",Karen
Sure.,Pam
"Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.",Darryl
Who did this to you? [refers to Pam crying] Where is he?,Dwight
"What? No, it's not... it's nothing.",Pam
[takes off coat to tie around waist] It's hot in here.,Dwight
Yeah.,Pam
Yeah.,Dwight
[Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don't need to stay here.,Pam
"I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?",Dwight
Hello everyone. Hello Michael.,Jan
Guh.,Michael
"Hi Jan, you look... tan.",Kevin
I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister.,Jan
Yeah. How was it?,Kevin
"Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.",Jan
"OK, yup.",Michael
"Why am I here, Michael?",Jan
I...,Michael
"In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?",Jan
I... I... Yes.,Michael
"I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.",Jan
"OK, yeah.",Michael
"This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks.",Jan
Who is Dr. Perry? I...,Michael
"This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you.",Jan
"And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.",Michael
"Good, good.",Jan
"So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh...",Michael
"Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time...",Jan
"Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate - [Jan leans over and kisses Michael passionately]",Michael
"Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.",Jan
"Jan, you... complete... me.",Michael
"Oh, God.",Jan
"Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico?",Roy
Yeah.,Pam
"I was definitely right. [both laugh] Oh, brother.",Roy
What am I going to do? [Refers to large pictures of Jan and Michael] I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art. [smirks],Kevin
"I just had the best, most romantic week of my life in Sandals, Jamaica. Went with a lady, and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free, because it was all-inclusive. And then I flew back to Scranton, and then they lost one of my bags.",Michael
"Hey, Mister tally man, tally me banana, six hand, seven hand, eight hand, BRUNCH! [snickers] So delicious. Dinner, too. And every morning I would watch the sunrise and I would eat a mango. That is how I want to feel all the time. It's called island living. You know, how they say take a chill pill? In Jamaica, I took one. Guy on the beach sold it to me for $40. And after I finished vomiting, I was more relaxed than I ever have been. Lost six pounds, too. That's how I want every day to be.",Michael
"Michael sends me a postcard from every vacation he goes on. Atlantic City, he wishes I was here. Busch Gardens, Virginia, all I got was this lousy postcard. And this time, I'm Jamaican-him-crazy. I don't know how far away he thought he was, because he put $10 worth of stamps on this.",Pam
"Hello, you're back.",Dwight
"Yeah, mon. Me just got back to the office.",Michael
While you were gone...,Dwight
Me had an i-rey time.,Michael
"While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 AM, and I was the only one who showed up.",Dwight
"Dwight, please, please.",Michael
He turned over my...,Dwight
"I just got back from vacation, mon, all right? So chill. Let's don't... Don't harsh my mellow, mon.",Michael
"I took a vacation once. Never again. While I was away, Jim had my desk shipped to me in Roswell.",Dwight
"Presents. I got presents for everybody. Dwight, a genuine Rastafarian wig.",Michael
Unbelievable.,Dwight
"Andy, I got you a genuine Jamaican T-shirt. They love Milli Vanilli down there.",Michael
"I give thanks, mon.",Andy
"You are so welcome, mon. Angela, you just got leied. [puts lei on Angela]",Michael
"No, I didn't.",Angela
"Yes, you did. Okay. Oh, Pam, I forgot to get you something.",Michael
That's okay.,Pam
I'm just kidding. Coconuts for your coconuts!,Michael
No.,Pam
[laughs] Try it on.,Michael
No.,Pam
Go ahead. Let me know if I miscalculated the size. I don't think I did.,Michael
Thank you.,Pam
"Stanley, I got you some ganja. I'm just kidding. It's coffee. I bet you wish it was ganja.",Michael
"I just got back from vacay. Come on. Give me a break, man. [holds up CD] Waves over Jamaica, $6.99.",Michael
Did he actually give you some ganja?,Creed
No.,Stanley
You want some?,Creed
"Okay, let me tell you a little story. When I was on vacation, I met a man named Bavon. And Bavon takes people parasailing. And you know what he said to me? He said that he loves going to work every day. How many of you can say that you love going to work every day like Bavon? [Dwight and Andy raises hand] No one.",Michael
"But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that's fun.",Kevin
"His name is Bavon. And you know what? I'm sure Bavon gets sick of his job, too. I'm sure he would like to take a day off. I'm sure he would like to spend a vacation selling paper, but he has the right attitude. And that is something that you learn when you go to Jamaica, and you really apply yourself.",Michael
"I would love to take them all to Jamaica, but is that good management? Yes. But is it the best management? Well, I can't afford it, and corporate won't pay for it. So who's the real criminal?",Michael
"How many of you know the meaning of the Jamaican term, Hakuna Matata?",Michael
[raises hand] Are you stoned?,Jim
I...,Michael
"In the picture, are you high?",Jim
"Oh, that's red eye.",Michael
Is that not what happens when you're high?,Jim
You look like you have the munchies.,Kevin
Well...,Michael
I have the munchies. I'm gonna get some of those chocolate wafers.,Kelly
"Hey, can we just focus?",Michael
Michael and Jan together in Jamaica. I guess I would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes.,Pam
"I don't know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michael's way into Photoshop. For example, I never went with him to Egypt. [holds up picture with Michael and himself in Egypt]",Ryan
Where did you save the list of exchanges?,Phyllis
I will gladly give you that information when my bonus comes through.,Stanley
But I won't be able to do inventory without it.,Phyllis
Then you won't be able to do inventory.,Stanley
"Yeah, I really like Stanley, but I'm not always sure if he likes me. I guess that's okay, 'cause I don't really like him.",Phyllis
Come on. Come on.,Dwight
"Okay. Well, Jan's email password is not Dunder Mifflin, Sandals, Jamaica, Michael, Michael Scott, Jan Scott, or Mrs. Jan Scott.",Michael
Try Dwight.,Dwight
"Her passwords aren't going to be Dwight, Dwight. That's stupid. Okay.",Michael
"Don't you have some sort of chaser or gobbler thing that you can send out that's able to eat up that other emails? I read about something like that. Well, I am in America and I am online, so I do think it involves you. Uh-huh. And if I were a subscriber, would then you be able to send out the gobbler? I'd... Yes, I will hold.",Michael
So your trip to Scottsdale was good?,Someone

Your body is a temple. You have to respect it. You can't just whore it out.,Angela
"I should be turned on. But, last year, remember, I had that skin cancer scare, and so now all I can think is that I hope she was wearing sunscreen. God, I would love to rub some on her.",Kevin
"The worst part about the Internet, when a secret is out, everyone knows. The best part about the Internet, that video of the dancing Indian midget, crossbow.org, massively multiplayer online gaming, i.e. Everquest. I also enjoy online banking.",Dwight
"Okay. So I went on the Internet, and she is not gonna find another apartment for that price. I mean this one is twice as much, and it doesn't have parking. Does she like to park?",Pam
"Oh, loves it.",Jim
Okay. This one is the same price but it's got...,Pam
Green walls.,Jim
I think that's mold.,Pam
Ooh... fancy.,Jim
"Spiderman, Peter Parker, would not reveal his love for Mary Jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the Green Goblin. Now, if Michael had studied the Spidey principles that I'd drawn up for him, Jan's boobs might not be all over the Internet. [Dwight pretends to shoot out webs from his palms]",Dwight
"Attention everyone! May I have your attention, please? Listen up. If we all work really hard and focus, we should be out of here in seven hours. Now, somewhere in these stacks, I have hidden a deck of cards. That should motivate you to keep your eyes open. If you find the deck of cards, you can redeem it with me in exchange for a free soft drink. [Jim shuffles the deck of cards] Get back... Back to work!",Dwight
"Yes, it is The Island Luau Inventory '07. It's actually a success compared to Disco Audit '05.",Pam
What's the problem?,Roy
We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we're supposed to.,Ryan
Let me see this. [scans one box seven times] Looks good to me.,Roy
"I wouldn't have come, but I know Jan is showing up soon. I don't wanna miss the show.",Stanley

"Please, I can double your pace.",Dwight
"Oh, yeah? Prove it, champ. You ready?",Andy
Let's go.,Dwight
"One, two, three, go!",Andy
[Dwight and Andy stacking boxes rapidly] Nice.,Jim
"Get out of my way, Jim!",Andy
"Jim, move!",Dwight
Okay.,Jim
Okay.,Dwight
Dang it.,Andy
Two at a time!,Dwight
Those aren't straight. Totally crooked. Totally crooked. You're disqualified.,Andy
[to herself] Be careful. [yells as boxes fall on her] Hello? I'm stuck!,Meredith
"Hey, Stanley, in case I don't see you again after tonight, here is your bonus, $1,000 cash. Keep the change. [hands Stanley a piece of Jamaican currency]",Michael
There is a butterfly on this. Why?,Stanley
It is Jamaican. The exchange rate is 65-to-1. I don't remember in which direction.,Michael
"So it's either worth $15 bucks or $65,000.",Stanley
"Yes, good luck with that.",Michael

"Hi, Jim.",Harvey
Hello.,Jim

You know what? Get Pam.,Michael
For this?,Jim
Pam.,Michael
"Pam, you look very hot today.",Harvey
"Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.",Jim
Great.,Pam

Who is 'Long Tim'?,Pam
Damn it.,Michael
Long time. Me lobe yoy long time.,Harvey
"Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?",Jim
I would love to meet Long Tim.,Pam

"You ruined a funny joke, you. Get out of my offive.",Harvey
Ok.,Jim
Ok. Bye Harvey.,Pam
Boobs.,Harvey
Angela.,Kevin

That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?,Kevin
They arrived this morning.,Angela
Are you sure? It is a big deal.,Kevin
Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?,Angela
... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.,Kevin
"Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.",Andy
Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam's desk],Angela
Everything is fine. You are in the clear.,Dwight
Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those.,Angela
"Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.",Michael
"Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?",Andy
"Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.",Michael
"Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott.",Andy
Oh.,Michael
Ph. D. Doctor of Sales.,Andy
"Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.",Michael
"Well, it is very gracious of you to accept.",Andy
"Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.",Michael
We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.,Phyllis
"Oh, uh, thanks.",Karen
"Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.",Michael
Pass.,Stanley
You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.,Michael
... I'll take the kid.,Stanley
I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.',Ryan
So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.,Michael
"Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?",Dwight
Yup. I'll trade.,Jim
"Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.",Jim
Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage.,Andy
Dwight?,Michael
Yup?,Dwight
Here ya go. [throws laundry],Michael
Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?,Dwight
Please.,Michael
He does your laundry?,Andy
"Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the 'Amazing Race.' [To Ryan and Stanley] And you guys are the retired marines. [To Phyllis and Karen] And you guys are the mother and daughter. [To Dwight and Jim] And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?",Michael
"Wait, 'Amazing Race' like, the biggest sale wins?",Karen
"No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.",Michael
Is there a prize?,Ryan
Just bragging rights.,Michael
Then how is this 'Amazing Race'?,Phyllis
"It's just... brrrrrr... It's 'Amazing Race,' Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it.",Michael
Come on!!,Dwight
Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.],Phyllis
"Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!",Michael
Bueno.,Andy
Do you have a pole?,Phyllis
Let's go get a broom.,Karen
Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?,Jim
"Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.",Dwight
Here we go.,Michael
"In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.",Andy
What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?,Andy
"Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.",Michael
"Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.",Andy
Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?,Angela
Really?,Pam
"Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.",Angela
Ok. Sure.,Pam
Ok.,Angela
"Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?",Karen
Um-hmmm.,Phyllis
"Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?",Ryan
You want the lead?,Stanley
"Yeah, if you don't mind.",Ryan
Mind? Nothing would delight me more.,Stanley
Leave the keys.,Dwight
You still do that thing?,Jim
Leave the keys!,Dwight
"I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?",Andy
Hawkman.,Michael
My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.,Andy
[Walks out of the Ladies' Restroom] Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.,Michael
After you sir.,Jim
"No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.",Dwight
"Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.",Jim
"Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight]",Dwight
"Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.",Pam
This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.,Angela
That's great.,Pam
"Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?",Angela
"Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?",Michael
Yep.,Buyer
"You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.",Michael
Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once.,Andy
"You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.",Michael
"Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York.",Andy
"Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We've had some problems in the past.",Buyer
"I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.",Michael
"Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.",Andy
No.,Michael
"I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.",Andy
Stop it. [Puts his hand on Andy's shoulder] Stop it.,Michael
Ow.,Andy
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?",Pam
Oh man. Talk about your classic 'Lame dash O.' Do we even want that guy buying our paper?,Andy
Yes.,Michael
I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up.,Andy
"Ah, no. Don't worry about it.",Michael
I really 'Schruted' it.,Andy
What?,Michael
"Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?",Andy
I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.,Michael
It's a big order. Thanks Kenny.,Phyllis
"Yeah, thank you.",Karen
"Hey, how's Annie?",Phyllis
"Oh, she's great. This is us last year in Bermuda. Lovely place. You ever been to Bermuda?",Kenny
Stanley Hudson.,Julius
"Ah, Julius, how's it goin'?",Stanley
"Great, great, great.",Julius
Stanley.,Guy
So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.,Stanley
Hi.,Ryan
I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?,Stanley
Um... [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.,Ryan
"Hello, Ryan. What do you have for us?",Julius
Oh...,Ryan
We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.,Jim
Kay. 'Kay.,Man
Can I use your phone?,Dwight
"Yeah, sure, go ahead.",Man
Thanks.,Dwight
"Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.",Jim
[On Phone] One...,Dwight
We have discount prices on ink cartridges...,Jim
Three...,Dwight
"And, also, any forms that you are going to need...",Jim
Seven...,Dwight
We can custom make them.,Jim
Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.,Pam
"Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.",Pam
How much did you win?,Kevin
$100.00 ,Pam
I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.,Kevin
Cool. Congratulations.,Pam
"Thanks, so sweet.",Kevin
"Ha ha ha! And you just said, 'Hi! Hi! Hi!' Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!",Stanley
"We'll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys.",Man
Sure.,Dwight
"Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?",Jim
It's very.,Man
"Please keep holding, your call is very important to us.",Phone
"Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time.",Dwight
[Dials cell Phone] And this is Dunder-Mifflin.,Jim
"Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly.",Kelly
"Hey, Kelly, it's Jim.",Jim
"Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up]",Kelly
"Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays.",Dwight
"All right, I get it. We got a deal.",Man
Thanks.,Jim
"Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.",Pam
That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.,Angela
Oh.,Pam
I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.,Angela
Oh?,Pam
Mmm-hmm.,Angela
Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.,Pam
Well then. Have a nice day.,Angela
Thanks. That was fun.,Karen
"Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.",Phyllis
Thank you.,Karen
I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.,Phyllis
That's nice.,Karen
You can pay me back later for the makeover.,Phyllis
Hey boss. Got a minute?,Andy
"Yes, Andy.",Michael
"I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?",Andy
He didn't say.,Michael
"That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?",Andy
"No, you are remembering it wrong.",Michael
"Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.",Michael
I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.,Dwight
"Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.",Jim
My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.,Dwight
We should go on a double date.,Jim
No thank you.,Dwight
"Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote 'Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.'",Jan
I knew it. [Dwight and Jim walk in],Michael
"Oh, doggie.",Andy
"Hey, do you want to grab a coffee?",Karen
Sure. Look at you!,Jim
Yeah.,Karen
"Beesley, coffee?",Jim
"No, thanks. I had some already.",Pam
All right.,Jim
"Oh, but, hey, Jim.",Pam
Yeah.,Jim
I won an art contest today.,Pam
No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five],Jim
Thanks.,Pam
Which one was it?,Jim
I sent in one of my watercolors.,Pam
Cool.,Jim
It was the new one I did.,Pam
Oh,Jim
You ready Jim?,Karen
Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
Congratulations.,Jim
Thanks.,Pam
Big deal.,Jim
"Hey, we nailed the sale!",Dwight
Where were you this morning?,Michael
I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.,Dwight
"Why do you lie, liar?",Michael
I am not a liar.,Dwight
You are lying right now.,Michael
It sure seems like he is lying.,Andy
"Stay out of this, you!",Dwight
"I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.",Michael
"Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.",Dwight
"Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.",Michael
That's what she said.,Dwight
Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.,Michael
It's going to be ok.,Dwight
"How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.",Angela
That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.,Dwight
I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.,Angela
"Well, I don't have a lot of choices.",Dwight
"So, let me ask you a question.",Karen
Ok.,Jim
Did you ever have a thing for Pam?,Karen
"Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?",Jim
I moved here from Connecticut...,Karen
"Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?",Jim
Kay.,Karen
"Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .",Dwight
"Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome. Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy? No, he was not. He was a total douche. Doompity-doomp.",Andy
I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.,Dwight
Good luck.,Michael
"Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.",Ryan
"Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.",Angela
"One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.",Dwight
Hey man. [Dwight hugs Jim and leaves],Jim
What happened on your sales call?,Karen
"Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty... [camera had focused in on Angela watching] Hello? Pretty good.",Andy
I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.,Dwight
"For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts: professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia.",Dwight
I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.,Dwight
"How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.",Dwight
There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.,Dwight
"[in Staples uniform] I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over.",Dwight
[to Ryan] Big Turkey. [cellphone plays 'Rockin' Robin'],Andy
Is that you singing?,Jim
All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.,Andy
Nice job.,Jim
Thank you muchly. [cellphone continues playing],Andy
You gonna answer it?,Jim
I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring.,Andy
Yikes.,Jim
Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you.,Andy
Thank you.,Jim
"I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience. So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna. [sings] Andy and the tuna...",Andy
"I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.",Jim
"Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.",Michael
The cost of doing business.,Andy
"Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman...",Michael
Was the top salesman...,Andy
I said 'was'.,Michael
[chuckles] Addition by subtraction.,Andy
What does that even mean? That is impossible.,Michael
Mmmm. Yeah you're right.,Andy
"But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits.",Michael
"Hey, everyone.",Oscar
"Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation?",Kevin
"Oh, that's very funny.",Oscar
"Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.",Kevin
"[sits at his desk] Hi, Angela.",Oscar
Oscar.,Angela
"Hey, boss.",Andy
"Hey, what's up.",Michael
Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?,Andy
Yep.,Michael
"Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my 'Lost' on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?",Andy
I don't know. Maybe.,Michael
"Well, I will take that as a maybe. [Michael gets up] Where are you going?",Andy
Bathroom.,Michael
"Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you.",Andy
"[lurking by the bathroom door] Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss.",Andy
Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?,Angela
The one of all women?,Oscar
Yeah.,Angela
Because I'm gay?,Oscar
No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.,Angela
"OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.",Oscar
Thank you. [sniffles],Angela
Can I join too?,Kevin
Never.,Angela
You sell those two printers this morning? Nice work.,Staples Guy
[scoffs] Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.,Dwight
Wow. [walks over to the plant] What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.,Michael
Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?,Pam
Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.,Michael
"Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight.",Pam
Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.,Michael
"Feel ya, dawg.",Andy
"Yeah, do you?",Michael
Absolutely.,Andy
What did I say?,Michael
You said... [makes gibberish noises],Andy
Huh.,Michael
"Which is like, 'Right on.' And Pam was like 'blah blah blah' and you were like 'Yeah, psht.' Nailed it.",Andy
"Oh, no.",Michael
"Oh, no.",Andy
"Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot. Too much. Like a crazy person. A little. Not super crazy... just... there's something about him that creeps me out. I can't really explain it. He's always up in my bidness. Which is ebonics for 'being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me.' I don't understand how someone could have so little self-awareness.",MIchael
I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.,Oscar
"No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.",Michael
Michael --,Oscar
"No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.",Michael
Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.,Oscar
"Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one.",Michael
Need any help?,Dwight
"Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking.",Lady
Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.,Dwight
Okay. [moves away],Lady
"I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. [fake casts off] Whizzzzz. [catches Jim] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. [Jim gets up] Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!",Andy
Hey.,Jim
Hey.,Karen
So Andy is in rare form today.,Jim
"Yeah, you should not encourage him.",Karen
"Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.",Jim
"Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't.",Karen
Fine. Party pooper.,Jim
Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.,Michael
185 pounder. Check it out. Whew! ['displays' Jim who looks thoroughly annoyed],Andy
"Hey, Ryan?",Jim
What?,Ryan
You wanna pull a prank on Andy?,Jim
"Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.",Ryan
I liked you better when you were the temp.,Jim
"Yeah, me too.",Ryan
Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay?,Michael
Sort of. He had a lot of clients.,Phyllis
"Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?",Michael
"Oh, sure, we talk all the time.",Stanley
Really?,Michael
No.,Stanley
"Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.",Michael
No. Sorry.,Phyllis
Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.,Phyllis
Really comin' down out there. Commute's gonna be hell.,Paris
I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.,Dwight
"So um, where were you workin' before this?",Paris
Dunder-Mifflin.,Dwight
What kind of company is that?,Paris
[scoffs] Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area.,Dwight
I never heard of 'em.,Paris
Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?,Dwight
"You gonna be like that, huh?",Paris
"I don't like him, his giant head, or his beady little eyes. That's all I got to say on the matter.",Paris
"[singing] In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed.",Andy
Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?,Jim
"Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please.",Pam
"Okay, good. Stay right here.",Jim
"[after Jim knocks over his pencils] Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.",Andy
[hands Pam Andy's phone] Are there any messages?,Jim
Nope.,Pam
So weird.,Jim
[takes the phone] Hmm.,Pam
Nice to have Oscar back.,Michael
Yeah.,Angela
Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?,Andy
No.,Jim
Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.,Andy
Angela?,Pam
Oh. [hands Pam tape],Angela
Is everything okay?,Pam
No.,Angela
What's going on?,Andy
What are you talking about?,Jim
Where is my FREAKING phone?!,Andy
You know what? Maybe it's in the ceiling.,Jim
Maybe you're in the ceiling!,Andy
Okay.,Jim
"[trying to look in Phyllis's desk, she slams the drawer shut] I don't trust you, Phyllis!",Andy
"I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.",Angela
Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.,Michael
Yes.,Angela
Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?,Michael
None of them. Especially not Andy.,Angela
"Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.",Michael
Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?,Andy
Um.,Michael
"Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll hit the tiz-own.",Andy
No. I don't want to do any of that.,Michael
Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.,Andy
"No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy.",Michael
"Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. [Andy's phone rings] Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny! Oh, my GOD. [punches a hole in the wall] That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?",Andy
Yeah.,Pam
Sure? Okay.,Andy
"[to customer] Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you.",Dwight
Hey.,Michael
Hey.,Dwight
What's up?,Michael
Same old.,Dwight
Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.,Michael
"Oh my God, she told you?",Dwight
"Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.",Michael
Accepted.,Dwight
How's this place treating you?,Michael
[scoffs] The boss isn't funny.,Dwight
"Oh, well.",Michael
I don't get to wear my ties.,Dwight
No. I'm sure.,Michael
So?,Dwight
"So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.",Michael
I don't want to do your laundry anymore.,Dwight
We can talk about that. [Dwight high fives Michael] All right.,Michael
"[inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall.",Jim
I think we broke his brain. [they both snicker],Pam
[imitating Andy] 'It's not freakin' funny!',Jim
Are you enjoying your fiesta?,Angela
"Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- [Angela walks away] it's great.",Oscar
Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!,Michael
Yay. [scattered appalause],Everybody
Welcome back.,Angela
Thank you.,Dwight
"Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. [looks around the room] Not bad, huh?",Michael
You did this for me? [camera pans to 'Welcome Back Oscar' sign],Dwight
Guilty.,Michael
Oh... Where did you get this stuff?,Creed
Gerty's.,Meredith
Which aisle?,Creed
I don't remember.,Meredith
"Well, draw me a map, mama.",Creed
Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.,Michael
"No, I will not.",Pam
So does this remind you of your childhood right now?,Michael
It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.,Oscar
"Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much.",Michael
Hey.,Jim
[sighs] Do you still have feelings for her?,Karen
[long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes.,Jim
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor? [hands broom to Dwight, though Oscar thinks he's handing it to him]",Michael
"Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! [beats up pinata]",Dwight
It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.,Michael
"So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. [gets out of his car] This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so.",Andy
"Oh, hi. You must be Andy.",Marcy
"Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy!",Andy
"That's right, it's so good to meet you.",Marcy
It's so good to meet you!,Andy
"Thanks. Well, you ready to have some fun?",Marcy
Yeah.,Andy
"Hello son. If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead. Life is a road---",Michael
How do you know it's going to be a boy?,Dwight
"How, would you stop interrupting please?",Michael
"Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock. And when I came to, I had an epiphery. Life is precious. And if I die I want my son to know the dealio. The dealio of life.",Michael
Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to.,Michael
"To jump start a car, first pop the hood. Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine. Then you take these and clip them wherever.",Michael
[Shakes head],Dwight
"Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra.",Michael
What?,Pam
We will demonstrate on Pam.,Michael
No. No. [Leaves],Pam
Come on.,Michael
[Dwight is wearing a bra] You just twist your hand until something breaks.,Michael
Ow.,Dwight
Well you get the picture. Thanks Pam.,Michael
"And remember no matter what, I will always love you.",Michael
What if he's a murderer?,Dwight
He's not going to be a murderer.,Michael
Maybe that's how you die.,Dwight
"You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?",Michael
I want to do this.,Dwight
Okay. From the top. Ready? Three-,Michael
Action.,Dwight
"Hello everyone! As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding. [Applause] So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did. And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one. This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever. It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins. So I am instituting prima nocta.",Michael
"Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night. So...",Jim
I'm sorry. I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.,Michael
"I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes. Which won't be hard, because it's going to be awesome. A lot better than hers, that's for sure. It'll probably be on a boat.",Michael
What's up spinsters?,Michael
Nothing. You know this is a luncheon shower. Girls only.,Angela
"No problem. The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse. From 2:30 to 3:15. It is the only time that Bob was available. Sort of a guy's night out. A G-N-O if you will. A Gah-No. Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in. A G-A-I. A gay. Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys. A guy shower. An hour long shower with guys.",Michael
I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever.,Karen
"Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.",Jim
"Something's up with Jim and Karen. Not that I've been eavesdropping. It's not really any of my business, but I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck.",Pam
"Halpert! Tall, queer, handsome as ever. Hey everybody it's me, Jim. Hello, hello. Todd Packer.",Packer
Karen Fillipelli. Jim's girlfriend.,Karen
Shut up!,Packer
Yep.,Karen
Shut it!,Packer
That's rude.,Karen
Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight!,Packer
Yes. Yes! Oh! There-oh! [Clutches chest and falls to the floor],Michael
What happened?,Packer
Oh God-,Michael
Quick somebody help! Help the man! [Pretends to kick Michael],Packer
"No, no, no!",Michael
"I can't believe you're not going to be there. It's going to be good, it's going to be a great bachelor party man.",Michael
I have a full day of sales calls.,Packer
You should get out of them.,Michael
[Breaks pencil.],Packer
"It's the only time he can do it. 2:30 to 3:15. It's going to be great. We're going to be doing some darts, we're going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie. Going to be very delicious.",Michael
And what kind of stripper did you get?,Packer
I did not order a stripper.,Michael
You didn't order a stripper? Have you ever even been to a bachelor party?,Packer
"Um, not personally, no.",Michael
"Mike, okay, a stripper is bachelor party 101. If you don't get a stripper your party is going to suck it hard.",Packer
I can't get a stripper here. Sexual Harassment.,Michael
"Just get one for the girls too. That evens it out. You know, separate but equal.",Packer
So that's what that means.,Michael
"Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh! [Spanks himself]",Michael
Alright! Uh! [Spanks himself],Dwight
Gay.,Michael
What?,Dwight
Okay. Co-ed naked strippers in this office. For realsies.,Michael
Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.,Angela
SHUT UP ANGELA!,Meredith
Hey.,Pam
Hey.,Jim
Ugh.,Pam
Ugh.,Jim
Everything okay?,Pam
Oh yeah. Why?,Jim
Well you seem a little tired.,Pam
"Oh. Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.",Jim
You should get more sleep.,Pam
"Yeah, I know I should.",Jim
Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep.,Pam
"No, I'm sure you're right.",Jim
"When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference.",Pam
Really?,Jim
Oh yeah. Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping. Better than not.,Pam
Good advice Beesley. Thanks. See you out there.,Jim
Yeah. Don't fall asleep at your desk. [Turning towards the vending machine] Oh my God.,Pam
Okay. We are off. Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.,Michael
Absolutely not.,Jim
I'm on it.,Dwight
Well get on it. And make it happen.,Michael
"Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats. No, TATS. Of course I want-",Dwight
Stop. That's disgusting.,Jim
Leave me alone and get the male stripper.,Dwight
Fine.,Jim
"I knew you would, Nancy.",Dwight
Sally.,Jim
"No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?",Dwight
Blonde.,Jim
Nice. Do you have any blonde women?,Dwight
[Giggles.],Michael
He hasn't even said a word yet. Just giggling.,Ryan
"[Pokes Ryan with a sex toy.] Gotcha, oh! [Phone rings.] Yes?",Michael
Are you okay?,Jim
"I'm in the, I'm in the sex shop.",Michael
"Ah, gotcha. Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.",Jim
Squarepants?,Michael
"Yep, Spongebob Squarepants.",Jim
And you think that'd be sexy?,Michael
"Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings. Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.",Jim
Hold the door please!,Ben Franklin
Oh.,Michael
Thank you.,Ben Franklin
Oh. Hello!,Michael
Hello!,Ben Franklin
You wearing a thong?,Michael
What?,Ben Franklin
Sparkling cider is very good.,Angela
I think that's champagne.,Pam
[Spits champagne back into her glass],Angela
"Hello ladies. Who here is a history buff? Who's a fan of buff naked? Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin.",Michael
"Thank you for that introduction, Mr. Scott, and good afternoon fine gentlewomen of Dunder Mifflin.",Ben Franklin
"Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?",Michael
"Knickers in fact, yes!",Ben Franklin
"He's in his knickers. Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.",Michael
"Well, actually, I never was president.",Ben Franklin
"Yes, but, Ben Franklin was.",Michael
Ah. I'm here to teach you a little bit about my life and the era of the founding fathers.,Ben Franklin
And when they came over on the Mayflower. Bow chicka bow.,Michael
"Wait, this is the entertainment?",Meredith
"Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them. Especially that one. [Points to Phyllis]",Michael
Have you ever seen a stripper before?,Jim
Yes. Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias. It was one of her many aliases.,Dwight
"Yeah, me neither.",Jim
Hey.,Elizabeth
Hi.,Jim
"I'm Elizabeth, I'm the dancer that was requested.",Elizabeth
"Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper.",Dwight
I'm the stripper.,Elizabeth
"Oh, okay good. Well in the future please identify yourself as such.",Dwight
[Phone rings] Oh God.,Jim
"[Reading the text message] Is she hot? Text back, 'Kind of.'",Dwight
"It was a warm June evening in 1752, the night of my fateful kite flight.",Ben Franklin
Mr. Franklin?,Karen
Yes?,Ben Franklin
Do you have a girlfriend?,Karen
"I have a lovely wife, Deborah.",Ben Franklin
But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris? Like a lot of them?,Pam
"Uh, well that is a grey area of my life. Okay? So, it was a warm June evening.",Ben Franklin
Look at that. Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors.,Michael
Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?,Ryan
No. Yes.,Michael
Oh gross.,Ryan
But I got all the foot off of it.,Michael
Okay Ben Franklin!,Pam
Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem with his mouth!,Karen
"Well, that is because I am a renaissance man.",Ben Franklin
"Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?",Pam
"Well, you're very saucy! [Winks at Pam.]",Ben Franklin
"Guys, beef! It's what's for dinner! Who wants some man meat?",Michael
I do! I want some man meat!,Dwight
"Michael, Dwight would like your man meat.",Jim
"Well then my man meat, he shall have. There you go. Deliciousity.",Michael
[Stanley's fork breaks.] Of course.,Stanley
"So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use?",Karen
Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.,Pam
"Hey um, I wanted to talk to you. I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys.",Karen
What do you mean?,Pam
"Well that you kissed. And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal. It's just a kiss. Wait- you're not still interested in him?",Karen
Oh yeah.,Pam
Really?,Karen
"Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing. You should definitely go out with Jim. I mean, you're going out with Jim. I'm not going out with Jim. You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together.",Pam
Okay.,Karen
I'm not into Jim. Yeah.,Pam
"So um, well good.",Karen
Yeah. Sorry.,Pam
What are you sorry about?,Karen
"Um, what?",Pam
What are you sorry about?,Karen
Nothing. I was just thinking of something else.,Pam
"Okay. The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild.",Kevin
I call shuffle. Here we go. [Spreads cards out all over the table],Michael
Michael.,Kevin
"Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here. Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth.",Michael
Hi guys!,Elizabeth
Nice outfit.,Michael
I hear there's an important meeting here.,Elizabeth
I'm not really into strippers. You know what I find sexy? Pam's art. She's an artist and I appreciate that. It's very moving and sexy. The art.,Roy
Hit it. [Feel Like Makin' Love plays in background] So where's the groom?,Elizabeth
He's right there. There he is.,Michael
Absolutely not. That's all you. That's all you.,Bob Vance
"Okay. Alright, I'll do it. Yeah. Lets do it. Lets do this thing. Yeah. What do I?",Michael
Just sit on down.,Elizabeth
Alright.,Michael
Alright.,Elizabeth
Okay.,Michael
Here we go.,Elizabeth
Here we go. Alright!,Michael
Yeah!,Elizabeth
Not bad! Not bad! You smell nice. Like Tide.,Michael
"Mmm, what's that?",Elizabeth
You smell like Tide detergent. Do you use Tide detergent? Ha ha ha! I have a girlfriend so...,Michael
I bet she'd be jealous. [Rips off shirt],Elizabeth
"Yeah she probably, yeah she would be. You know what, okay, excuse me. Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music. This is wrong, this is wrong! This is wrong! I have a girlfriend. And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay. Shame on you. Go back to work!",Michael
"Elizabeth, I want you to sit here. When the phone rings, answer it.",Dwight
You want me to answer phones with my clothes on.,Elizabeth
We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it.,Dwight
Oh I love your poster.,Elizabeth
Thank you.,Angela
[Mouths 'hi' at the stripper],Kevin
You know I invented electricity.,Ben Franklin
I know.,Pam
Well I'm sensing a little electricity right here.,Ben Franklin
Didn't Ben Franklin have syphilis?,Pam
"Yes, but I don't. My name is Gordon.",Ben Franklin
Ohhh.,Pam
On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I'm afraid she's going to dump me.,Michael
"You know Michael, I fathered an illegitimate son.",Ben Franklin
Really.,Michael
But I kept all this from my wife Deborah. These things only serve to upset the women. They are the gentler sex.,Ben Franklin
"Well, Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleezebag.",Michael
"Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women? Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?",Michael
"Secrets, secrets are no fun. Secrets, secrets hurt someone.",Elizabeth
Wow. Thank you.,Michael
Care for a piece of chocolate?,Dwight
Chocolate! Where did you acquire it? That is a delicacy in the Amazon but it has not yet been imported to the United States.,Ben Franklin
Who is the king of Austria?,Dwight
Joseph the 2nd.,Ben Franklin
Who is the king of Prussia?,Dwight
Fredrick Wilhelm the 3rd.,Ben Franklin
Who is the king of England?,Dwight
"Why the tyrant King George, of course!",Ben Franklin
"I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin. I am 99% sure.",Dwight
"[On speaker phone] Michael, I left a meeting. What is so urgent? Are you, are you okay?",Jan
"Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will.",Michael
Okay.,Jan
I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.,Michael
"Uh when, when did, when last night?",Jan
"No, today at work.",Michael
You went to a bachelor party at work?,Jan
Yes. I kind of arranged it.,Michael
Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot. Do you guys think she was hot?,Kelly
Kelly don't do this.,Ryan
Do what? I just asked you a question.,Kelly
You know what you're doing.,Ryan
"Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin? Pam.",Kelly
Really? Looks like I hired the right guy. I'm glad. Any real potential there Beesley?,Jim
"Yeah, right. God, I need a boyfriend. You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends. Whenever.",Pam
Ok.,Ryan
"Oh my God, I would get so fat if I worked here.",Elizabeth
Yeah? I lose my appetite all the time.,Pam
You could strip you know.,Elizabeth
Thanks.,Pam
So you don't want to end our relationship?,Michael
I'm closer to firing you.,Jan
That is so sweet. You are the best GD girlfriend in the world. Do you know that?,Michael
I'll talk to you later.,Jan
You are. You are.,Michael
"So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep? Ben Franklin. And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice. Which rhymed. Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't.",Michael
Are you near sighted or far sighted?,Dwight
Both. That's why I invented the bifocal.,Ben Franklin
GAH!!!,Dwight
"Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?",Jim
What do you think?,Dwight
"In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.",Jim
"[Windows reboot sound] Dwight, want an Altoid?",Jim
Okay.,Dwight
[Windows reboot sound] Altoid?,Jim
Sure,Dwight
[Windows reboot sound] Mint Dwight?,Jim
Inbwit? Yes.,Dwight
"[Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs]",Dwight
What are you doing?,Jim
I...,Dwight
What?,Jim
"I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. [nasty, dry mouth-smaking noise]",Dwight
"Always the bridesmaids, right ladies?",Michael
"Okay, for this next one everyone hop out. Just Phyllis and Dad. Actually, let's bring Mom back in. And the sisters. And you, and you, and you. Great.",Photographer
"Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding. Which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis. But it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride.",Michael
"Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.",Phyllis
"Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'.",Pam
So what's in the box?,Jim
"A toaster, you?",Stanley
A toaster.,Karen
Unbelievable.,Stanley
"Hello, Angela.",Dwight
"Hi, Dwight.",Angela
You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.,Dwight
Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left!,Angela
"The Shrutes have their own traditions. We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.",Dwight
Those flowers are nice.,Jim
Yeah. P and R?,Karen
Phyllis and Robert.,Jim
"Ah, of course.",Karen
"Also, Pam and Roy.",Pam
There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.,Michael
"Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside.",Phyllis
How you doin'? You excited.,Michael
"Yes, very.",Phyllis
"Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?",Michael
No.,Phyllis
"You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous...",Michael
That wasn't me.,Phyllis
Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle?,Michael
I thought it was...,Phyllis
"Here, let me...",Michael
Michael... No.,Phyllis
Just cover up that bald patch.,Michael
"I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone.",Phyllis
Okay.,Michael
You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.,Michael
[in video of Michael as a kid] I hate you!,Michael
Long story short: Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.,Michael
Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?,Dwight
You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.,Jim
No way.,Dwight
Did you ever see that movie?,Jim
Of course I saw it.,Dwight
"I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.",Dwight
"You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.",Jim
"Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift.",Dwight
[to Toby's date] Hi. I'm Kevin. [to Toby] Where did you find her?,Kevin
At the gym.,Toby
Riiight. The gym. [snickers],Kevin
Could you scoot over? You're on my dress.,Kelly
I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding.,Meredith
I know but there was an emergency.,Kelly
I look,Kelly
"This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it.",Michael
That's my dress.,Pam
[whispers to father] That's ok. [Albert gets out of his wheelchair and starts walking],Michael
It's a miracle.,Dwight
[generalized clapping],Crowd
This is bull****!,Michael
Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight.,Michael
"I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over.",Michael
"And do you, Phyllis, take Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration, to be your lawfully wedded husband?",Priest
I do.,Phyllis
"Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!",Michael
"And do you, Bob...",Priest
"Oh, shiii...",Michael
... take Phyllis to be your lawfully wedded wife,Priest
I do.,Bob Vance
You may now kiss the bride.,Priest
"Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance. [generalized clapping and cheering] Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!",Michael
"Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.",Angela
Thanks Angela.,Phyllis
"Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.",Michael
"If you ever lay I finger on Phyllis, I'll kill you.",Bob Vance
"Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. [to Albert] Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.",Michael
"Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.",Dwight
"I don't have that, Dwight.",Phyllis
"Dammit, Phyllis!",Dwight
Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.,Kelly
What do you mean?,Pam
Well... this was supposed to be your wedding.,Kelly
Oh... um... no. That's... um... That's actually fine,Pam
"There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant.",Kelly
"Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks",Pam
"Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?",Dwight
Who?,Uncle Al
The bride and groom? What are their names?,Dwight
"Oh, I... I don't... I'm not sure.",Uncle Al
"Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.",Dwight
"Okay, Okay. Where are we going?",Uncle Al
"Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.",Dwight
Oh!,Uncle Al
Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?,Michael
It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.,Phyllis
I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.,Michael
It's fish.,Phyllis
I will take care of that.,Michael
I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white.,Michael
No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.,Kevin
"Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. [sings] Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light.",Kevin
Hey.,Roy
Hey.,Pam
"I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh... This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste.",Roy
"You're kidding me, right?",Pam
"I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um... Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom.",Roy
"Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.",Pam
I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning.,Roy
Yeah.,Pam
Sorry about that.,Roy
It's okay.,Pam
You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married.,Roy
"Phyllis, you're a wonderful woman. And you're a hell of a bowler!",Randy

She is.,Unknown
Cheers.,Randy
Cheers.,Crowd
"Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance. One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines 'wedding' as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride 'Mawige...",Michael
"The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones.",Michael
"Phyllis and Bob: their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her... and she's kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was 'Easy Rider'. Now as for Bob... Bob Vance...",Michael
Oh okay. That's enough.,Bob Vance
is a guy that...,Michael
"Thanks, Michael. Give me...",Bob Vance
"he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn't say anything when Phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay.",Michael
Give me the microphone.,Bob Vance
No. I'm not going to...,Michael
"Give me... Give me the microphone, Michael.",Bob Vance
Ok. All right.,Michael
You're out of here!,Bob Vance
Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you!,Michael
Hey.,Jim
Hey!,Pam
When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?,Jim
Oh... I'm pacing myself.,Pam
Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.,Jim
No. I'm such a dorky dancer.,Pam
I know. It's very cute.,Jim
"Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical.",Jim
Come... Come on!,Michael
"I can't let you in, Michael.",Dwight
"Dwight, just...",Michael
"No, it's Bob and Phyllis' orders.",Dwight
"Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song.",Michael
"You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure.",Dwight
OK.,Michael
"Hey, they're playing our song.",Roy
"Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police.",Pam
I know. Uh... I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance?,Roy
[sings] ee... I was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.,Michael
"[to Pam] Hey, want to get out of here?",Roy
Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.,Jim
[sings] Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every...,Karen
"One... Two... Three. Ahhhh! [Phyllis throws the flowers, Ryan knocks them out of Kelly's hands, Toby's date gets them]",Women

I just want Phyllis to have a great day.,Michael
Phyllis and you will be great together.,Uncle Al
We are great together. We are a great team.,Michael
The Celtics were a great team.,Uncle Al
Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon.,Michael
Nobody ever helped me. I had to do it myself. Even the doctor didn't know!,Uncle Al
"Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.",Michael
Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember.,Michael
You found Uncle Al!,Phyllis
Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo.,Michael
"Thank you, Michael.",Phyllis
You're... You're welcome.,Michael
They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.,Michael
Be careful. Oh no!! [Phyllis and Bob smear cake on each other's face] Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me! [Michael smears cake on his own face],Michael
"Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?",Michael
"My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.",Kevin
Huh?,Michael
I almost died. I... I went into this skid---,Kevin
Pop quiz.,Michael
...What?,Kevin
Why is today a special day?,Michael
I almost died.,Kevin
"Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...",Michael
You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.,Ryan
"In business school, Kevin. Business school.",Michael
Wow.,Kevin
"If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid",Ryan
"A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.",Michael
Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?,Michael
Don't be an idiot.' Changed my life.,Dwight
"Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing.",Dwight
"Will they throw their hats, you think?",Michael
What?,Ryan
"A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.",Michael
Y-You understand nobody's graduating.,Ryan
"Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that: 'May your hats fly as high as your dreams.' ... That was a pretty good line.",Michael
...It doesn't apply.,Ryan
"I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! [pokes Ryan] Whoa, hey!",Michael
Quit it!,Ryan
We have fun.,Michael
I can't for your art show tonight.,Roy
"Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio.",Pam
I-I wouldn't miss it for the world.,Roy
Thanks.,Pam
I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.,Pam
Love ya.,Roy
You too.,Pam
"Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.",Jim
I can't believe you're back together with Roy!,Kelly
"Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.",Pam
Oh my God. You're so in love now.,Kelly
"Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.",Pam
"Oh, art show!",Kelly
"I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.",Pam
...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.,Kelly
"Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? [runs over, throws frisbee] Whoo!",Michael
....Dude.,College Student
...Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk],Dwight
"Dwight, what are you doing?",Pam
"Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!",Dwight
Oh my God!,Karen
BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!,Dwight
Goooood bye.,Stanley
[on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...,Angela
"Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.",Michael
"...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...",Ryan
"I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.",Michael
We have... a bat... in the office.,Dwight
The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open.,Toby
Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!,Angela
Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.,Jim
"At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.",Dwight
I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...,Jim
What? What's so wierd?,Dwight
"The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well.",Jim
"And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.",Ryan
"Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. [rips pages out of book] You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. [gives book back] I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.",Michael
"[sighs] This is your job, Halpert.",Dwight
Ow!,Jim
"Oh, what happened?",Karen
That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.,Jim
"But Jim, this garlic bread is cold.",Karen
What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.,Jim
No... no. One crisis at a time.,Dwight
"If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a 'sylvania.' Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.",Dwight
"So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or... [pulls out a candy bar] a Whatchamacallit [throws bar]. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay [takes out a PayDay, throws it]. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand [throws 100 Grand bar]. [pulls out a Snickers] Satisfied?",Michael
"Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.",Toby
"Oh! No, you should go.",Pam
"Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.",Toby
"Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.",Michael
Michael.,Ryan
...And products!,Michael
What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.,Ryan
"Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.",Michael
"Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?",Business Student #1
"We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. [everyone types on their laptops]",Michael
"Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted.",Karen
"Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.",Jim
What glare?,Karen
The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding.,Jim
"I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.",Dwight
Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--,Dwight
Sure.,Creed
--to use sudden violence.,Dwight
Okay.,Creed
Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?,Dwight
What size?,Creed
What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain?,Business Student #2
"...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back.",Michael
Has anyone ever come back?,Business Student #2
"...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid.",Michael
How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger?,Business Student #3
"Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index?",Michael
...What?,Business Student #3
"Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?",Michael
By your own employee's calculation you'll be obsolete in the next five to ten years.,Business Student #1
"...Wait, Ryan said that?",Michael
What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.,Kelly
Animals can't feel pain.,Creed
"Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!",Kelly
Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!,Dwight
AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT!,Kelly
[locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!,Kevin
"Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.",Michael
But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain?,Business Student #2
David will always beat Goliath.,Michael
"But there's five Goliaths, there's... Staples, Officemax...",Business Student #1
"Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?",Michael
But in the big picture...,Business Student #1
"Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. [walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT!",Michael
...It wasn't personal.,Ryan
"Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.",Michael
Pack my--?,Ryan
"You heard me, pack your things.",Michael
I really want to come out!,Meredith
"Good night, Mary Beth!",Creed
So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?,Jim
Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.,Dwight
"Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.",Jim
Goodbye Jim. And good luck.,Dwight
"Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.",Dwight
...And it's all from the same series.,Pam
Oh.,Woman
Called 'Impressions.',Pam
Oh.,Woman
"Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.",Pam
Maybe one day.,Woman
I hope so.,Pam
Mmm.,Woman
"I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. [Woman leaves, Roy enters] Hey, babe, how are you?",Pam
"Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh?",Roy
"Hey, Kenny.",Pam
Hey Pam.,Kenny
"How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?",Roy
Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith's head],Dwight
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!,Meredith
"Hold still, woman!",Dwight
Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh!,Meredith
...[captures bat in bag] ... You're welcome.,Dwight
"It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.",Roy
"Yeah, I'll just, I'll drive myself home.",Pam
To my place?,Roy
"Maybe, I'm a little tired.",Pam
Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art.,Roy
Thank you.,Pam
"Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.",Ryan
"Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.",Michael
To the annex? Where... Kelly is?,Ryan
"A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.",Michael
You're the one who said we needed more culture.,Oscar
This is culture to you?,Gil
It's her first try.,Oscar
"Yeah, on Van Gogh's first try, he drew the hands of the peasants.",Gil
Meaning what?,Oscar
"Meaning, real art takes courage, okay? And honesty.",Gil
"Well, those aren't Pam's strong points.",Oscar
"Yeah, exactly. That's why this is... motel art.",Gil
Thanks for coming.,Artist
"Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town.",Michael
"Oh, Michael.",Pam
Wow! You did these... freehand?,Michael
Yep.,Pam
"My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. [sighs] ... How much?",Michael
What do you mean?,Pam
I don't see a... price.,Michael
Um... you wanna buy it?,Pam
"Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car?",Michael
Uh-huh.,Pam
That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.,Michael
[hugs Michael] ... Thank you.,Pam
What?,Michael
Do you have something in your pocket?,Pam
...Chunky. Do you want half?,Michael
No thank you.,Pam
Okay.,Michael
"It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.",Michael

"Well ultimately I went into business to inspire people. They say those who can't do, teach. I can do both. I teach doing.",Michael
"OK, here we go... Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.",Jim
"Wow! That's a lot of books, do you have, umm, one book that sums up all of these.",Michael
Those are the books that sum up the other books.,Jim
So no?,Michael
What are you reading?,Jim
"Oh, umm, ever since I started here, I've kept a diary of all my sales.",Michael
"Oh, that could be interesting.",Jim
"No, it's just mileage mostly, but there's one chapter that I call wisdoms. I'm going to read you a series of statements, and I want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.",Michael
[clears throat] I am ready.,Jim
"Don't do what I say, say what I do.",Michael
Five.,Jim
Just getting warmed up. Mistakes are just successes that you mess up.,Michael
Hmm... Five.,Jim
This... You know this is a scale of one to ten?,Michael
Yeah.,Jim
OK. Do you want me to repeat that?,Michael
"No, I got it.",Jim

Don't Meredith.,Angela
You ready?,Meredith
You know I don't like to participate in the...,Oscar
Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?,Meredith
"Really, it's just that I don't like to participate...",Oscar
Grow up.,Meredith
"It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy.",Oscar
Get over yourself.,Meredith
"Well, I'm not going to get over myself... it's wrong.",Oscar
Because Roy use to... [long censor beep]... with the rice... [long censor beep]... [laughs],Meredith
[laughs] That's disgusting.,Oscar
[still laughing] I know.,Meredith
"Everybody please stand, and get up on your desks. [goes to stand on desk] Just stand right up.",Michael
Michael it's not... It's not...,Ryan
"That's, yep a little flimsy. Umm... OK... Ahh... Alright, no more desks. Oh OK.",Michael
"I have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow. Simple... [holds up snickers] Kids love candy bars.",Michael
"Lets try a little... Little social experiment here. Raise your hands if you like to buy things. OK, I see some people who like to buy things. You're it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause. Say, say you want to start a business, and business is all about buying and selling, is it not? So say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers. Something you have to keep in mind, you must, and you might want to jot this down, you must sell the stickers for more than you bought the stickers for.",Michael
How have you adopted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?,Student 1
"Oh, Oh, I take umbrage to that premise...ses. Umm, let me ask you this: How many people exist in the world? Over forty billion. What are they going to be writing on... rocks? Any one else? [points] Yep.",Michael
Just following up on that first question...,Student 2
"No no no no no. Never follow, always lead.",Michael

"No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!",Michael
"Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?",Jim
"I will get out. Oh yes, I will.",Michael
"So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?",Pam
"No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. [Michael spits out key, Jim covers it with his foot.]",Michael
AHHHH!,Michael
"Is everything ok, Michael?",Kevin
Yes.,Michael
"I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key...",Michael
Alright.,Michael
[trumpet sounds],Dwight
Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.,Michael
"Another worm? Like, are they friends?",Jim
It's early bird gets the worm.,Dwight
"Pam, would you smell my breath?",Michael
"No, no.",Pam
"Let me smell. [Michael breathes at Dwight] Good, not great.",Dwight
"Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?' Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special.",Michael
"Jimbo, last chance to carpool.",Michael
"Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.",Jim
Sure? Might be a good idea.,Michael
Yeah.,Jim
"Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.",Michael
Thanks.,Jim
Play some games?,Michael
Oh. Um. I think we're good.,Jim
I spy?,Michael
Yeah.,Jim
"Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?",Jim
Thanks for inviting me along.,Dwight
"Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? [phone rings] Heh-woh you.",Michael
Michael?,Jan
"Hey, Buttercup.",Michael
Hi.,Jan
I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...,Michael
Let's just blow this party off.,Jan
That's what she said.,Michael
Am I on speaker phone?,Jan
"Uh, yes you are.",Michael
Is anybody else in the...,Jan
"Hello, Jan.",Dwight
"Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.",Jan
No problem. [doesn't turn off speakerphone],Michael
Ok. Let's just go to a motel...,Jan
Ok.,Michael
...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.,Jan
"Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I...",Michael
Still on speaker?,Jan
Ummm... I don't know.,Michael
Are camera's there?,Jan
Maybe.,Michael
See you soon.,Jan
Ok.,Michael
"Talk to you later, Jan.",Dwight
Alright. Bye.,Michael
"Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come.",Pam
"I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered.",Roy
"Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.",Pam
Ok.,Roy
"I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy.",Pam
Beauty. Thank you sir!,Michael
Salad.,Dwight
Thank you.,Michael
You dressed exactly like the servants.,Dwight
"Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.",Michael
Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.,Dwight
"I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.",Michael
That would have been really embarrassing.,Dwight
Yes.,Michael
Crisis averted.,Dwight
Ok.,Michael
"Oh, that duck is so cute.",Pam
Hey Pam.,Kevin
Hey guys.,Pam
Oscar. Angela.,Kevin
Hi.,Michael
"Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.",Michael
"Oh, um, potato salad.",Michael
It's from both of us.,Dwight
"No, it's not.",Michael
"Wonderful, let's, ah, see where we can put this. Ok.",Rachel
"Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.",Michael
"It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.",Michael
"Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?",Pam
Yeah.,Kevin
"Oh my God, when is it?",Kelly
It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.,Kevin
Hey.,Roy
Hey. You made it.,Pam
"You said it was important, so... How's it going?",Roy
"What's up, Pam.",Kenny
"Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis.",Pam
"You guys, uh, want a round, on me?",Roy
Yeah.,Everyone
Yeah? Get you a drink.,Roy
Thanks man.,Kenny
"No thank you, Roy.",Angela
"Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces.",Dwight
What are you looking for? You bring dip?,Michael
"I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.",Jan
Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.,Michael
You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.,Jan
Over our love.,Michael
I've never told you that I love you.,Jan
"You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all.",Michael
"I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.",Jan
What's this over the 'i'?,Jan
It's a heart.,Michael
Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?,Jan
I love this woman!,Michael
"Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.",Jan
Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica?,Dwight
No.,Dan Gore
No? Then you are an idiot.,Dwight
Hello Michael.,Rachel
"Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything. Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So...",Michael
"Jan, glad you could make it.",David
"Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?",Jan
Of course I do.,David
From the Scranton Branch.,Jan
Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.,Michael
"David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.",Jan
Excuse me.,Rachel
Ok.,Michael
"[looks at beers] Oh. [Starts to walk away, turns around] No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.",Pam
"Oh, sorry.",Bartender
"So did the merger go smoothly, or?",Man
"It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.",Michael
I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.,Karen
"Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great?",Michael
"We're good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?",Jan
"Can I get anyone anything, or?",Rachel
I could go for an appeteaser.,Michael
Martini please.,Jan
Bagel bites or something.,Michael
"Rachel, your house is beautiful.",Karen
Thank you.,Rachel
What's the square footage?,Dwight
"About 5,000.",David
Does that include the garage?,Dwight
"Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate.",Michael
I'm just...,Dwight
I don't know,David
It's a common question.,Dwight
"David, how much did this house cost?",Michael
"These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.",Dwight
I'll show you around.,Rachel
"Cool, let's start with the banisters.",Dwight
"Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall?",Karen
Yep.,Jim
"That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date.",Karen
"Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me.",Jim
And it didn't end well.,Karen
Gotcha. Alright.,Jim
"This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch.",David
"Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. [takes sip, coughs violently]",Michael
You ok?,Jan
Yeah. Do you have any ice?,Michael
Sure.,David
How about some Splenda?,Michael
"One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here.",Roy
Where?,Kenny
On this side.,Roy
"No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly's hands]",Kevin
I think I heard it on Roy's side.,Ryan
"No, it is here.",Kevin
[tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.,Ryan
Good thing you didn't listen to me.,Kevin
"Yeah, close one.",Ryan
[points at one of Stanley's hands and one of Pam's] Not here. Not here. It's either here or here. [Stares at Pam] Not here. [Points at Stanley's hand].,Roy
YES!,Kenny
Nice job.,Pam
I can read you like a book.,Roy
Oh yeah?,Pam
You can't keep anything from me.,Roy
Hey Creed.,Student 1
Hey! What are you guys doing here?,Creed
You're the man buddy.,Student 2
I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station.,Creed
"Huh. [Bangs on wall] Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? [Opens door].",Dwight
"Uh, that's a guest room.",Rachel
Just the one window?,Dwight
[phone rings] Oh. I must get that. You'll have to excuse me.,Rachel
Are those real pearls?,Dwight
"Uh, yes.",Rachel
[tests smoke detector] Good.,Dwight
"Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.",Jim
"Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated.",Karen
Oh. Hadn't noticed.,Jim
Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable.,Karen
"No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.",Jim
This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.,Michael
It's nice.,Jan
You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.,Michael
"I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.",Jan
"Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.",Michael
Oh.,Jim
Crazy.,Michael
I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.,Jan
Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?,Michael
"Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael]",Jan
What are you doing?,Michael
Don't you know what I'm doing?,Jan
"Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.",Michael
Shut up.,Jan
What has gotten into you?,Michael
Come on.,Jan
"No, no, no.",Michael
What?,Jan
"Come on, let's go back to the party.",Michael
Just let me loosen my dress.,Jan
"Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan.",Michael
Michael.,Jan
"No, no, no, means please don't. Please.",Michael
"Slam me up against the wall, right here.",Jan
I'm not going to slam you up against the wall.,Michael
"Oh, please.",Jan
You're acting inappropriate. Jan.,Michael
"Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out.",Jan
Here. [hands Pam a duck stuffed animal],Toby
"Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.",Pam
I was...,Toby
"Hey, don't you have a daughter?",Pam
[takes duck back] Yes.,Toby
"Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?",Dwight
"I don't know, it was here when I was born.",Child
I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?,Dwight
I don't know.,Child
What do you know?,Dwight
"God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes.",David
"You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.",Jim
"Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me.",Karen
"Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me.",Jim
I so got you.,Karen
"So, none of them?",Jim
"Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first.",Karen
Really?,Jim
"Oh my God, it's so easy. Fun.",Karen
Ok.,Jim
Hey Jan.,Karen
Not too good.,Jan
Did you get a chance to try Michael's homemade potato salad?,Rachel
Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.,Michael
"What's ah, what's with Jan and Michael?",David
I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.,Jim
"The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.",Dwight
What?,Roy
I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.,Pam
That's awesome. That's what I want.,Roy
"Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us.",Pam
"I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all.",Roy
Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.,Pam
What?,Roy
"He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.",Pam
Jim came on to you?,Roy
Just listen.,Pam
"No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening!",Roy
Don't yell!,Pam
Don't yell?!,Roy
This is over.,Pam
"Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God!",Roy
Damn jet skis!,Kenny
"Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...",Michael
I feel sick.,Jan
You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?,Michael
"No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.",Jan
"Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.",Michael
Please don't cry.,Jan
I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.,Michael
"It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.",Jan
"I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.",Michael
I didn't mean it. I was...,Jan
Whatever.,Michael
"Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.",Jan
"That's all, you didn't mean it?",Michael
That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.,Jan
"I love you, Jan.",Michael
Ok.,Jan
"Don't break up you guys, you're great together.",Dwight
Are they going to call the cops?,Roy
"No, I paid them off.",Kenny
Jet ski money?,Roy
All of it.,Kenny
I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.,Roy
"I think it's great that Jim's invited. It's important to have contact with the New York execs, or they'll think everyone here is like Mi...chael.",Karen
[Points to Pam's painting of the building] [laughs] You gotta sign that.,Roy
[laughs],Pam
"No you gotta put your name in the corner. I've seen that artist do that. Its good too, cause like you can know who paints what, you know.",Roy
"Hey, are you going to Poor Richard's?",Ryan
"I don't know, you?",Toby
Maybe.,Ryan
I'm going and so are both of you. We're all going.,Kelly
"Hey, isn't there some rule against inter-office dating?",Ryan
[whispering] I am not doing your dirty work for you.,Toby
I hear whispering.,Kelly
"Ok, so promise that you'll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar.",Jim
Yes boss.,Pam
See ya Pam.,Karen
"Oscar, Angela? I didn't think you guys would come.",Kevin
Why wouldn't we come?,Angela
Because of reasons...,Kevin
Are there carbs in vodka?,Kevin
"Hey folks, what can I get you? Oh, hey Meredith.",Waiter
Hey,Meredith
Another vodka?,Waiter
"Yeah. Jack, these are my co-workers.",Meredith
Sup?,Kevin
"[pointing to each correct person] Ryan, Pam, Stanley, Kelly, Kevin, Creed. How'd I do?",Waiter
"Hmm, come here much?",Stanley
These wings are all fat and bone.,Oscar
This place is disgusting. [They smile at each other],Angela
Why would the architect design stairs this wide? Was there an obese family in here before you?,Dwight
I don't know that. I'm sure the architect passed away many years ago.,Rachel
How convenient.,Dwight
"I am attracted to weird, wrong men. I dated a violent karate instructor and then an unemployed fireman. Life has been complicated. I've made some decisions that I'm not proud of; my marriage, being overly litigious with my family. I orgasm fairly easily. Michael was kind of like my dirty secret, you know, having sex with him, oh I was just turned on by my own degradation. Um, why, anyway, I was told by somebody recently that I respect that I'm old enough to have a mature relationship, and that's what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes.",Jan
[at the door] Hi Ryan.,Melissa
Hey.,Ryan
"How are you doing? I've, I've missed you.",Melissa
I've missed you too...,Ryan
Don't you remember me?,Melissa
"Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint. Um, did you meet me at the gym?",Ryan
No.,Melissa
[still at the table] Who the hell is Ryan talking to?,Kelly
[at the door] Are you a client of Dunder Mifflin.,Ryan
No.,Melissa
"[at the table] Oh, not again. Melissa!",Stanley
Daddy.,Melissa
Wait for my outside. [To Ryan] She is sixteen years old. What is wrong with you?,Stanley
"Okay, okay. Stanley, let me explain to you what happened.",Ryan
"No, no, no, no.",Stanley
She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.,Ryan
"No, no, no. You planned this whole thing boy. I'll snatch your spine out your back.",Stanley
"Space shuttle. Which one? Oh, Atlantis. Good thing it's not the Discovery. You play soccer?",Dwight
"What a weird day. I don't understand it, but you don't get to understand everyday of your life. Maybe five, ten days a year, I'll get home and I will have no idea what the hell just happened. Guess everybody has days like that. Sometimes they're the nicest ones. Still, I think there might be something wrong with Jan.",Michael
So do you want to see it or not?,Karen
I don't know. Feel like... Friday night crowds...,Jim
"Oh my God, you're like, agoraphobic.",Karen
Agoraphobic?,Jim
Yeah.,Karen
Really?,Jim
"Yeah! You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend.",Karen
Absolutely correct.,Jim
"Later, Jim.",Kevin
"Kev, have a good weekend.",Jim
"Bye. Ok, so this is what's gonna happen. You're gonna suck it up.",Karen
Here we go...,Jim
...and we're gonna go to dinner.,Karen
Ok...,Jim
And then we're gonna go to the movies.,Karen
Sounds good.,Jim
Hey Halpert!,Roy
Hey... [Roy lunges towards Jim],Jim
ROY!,Pam
[shrieks],Karen
Roy don't! [Dwight pepper-sprays Roy],Pam
[screams in pain] Ahh God!,Roy
"Pam, please call security!",Dwight
"Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]",Dwight
"No need for consternation, everything is under control.",Michael
"Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!",Jan
"It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.",Michael
[sigh] Is Toby there?,Jan
No...,Michael
"I'm... here, Jan.",Toby
"Ok, what... what is the situation Toby?",Jan
"Well, we fired Roy, obviously. And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company.",Toby
Thank God.,Jan
"Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his...",Toby
"No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.",Michael
"All right, well are you gonna take care of this?",Jan
Yeppers.,Michael
What did I tell you about 'yeppers?',Jan
I don't... remember.,Michael
I told you not to say it. Do you remember that?,Jan
Yeesh...,Michael
"I really don't want to talk about it. I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened. It",Pam
"I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there. And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray. And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.",Jim
"Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy. Thank you.",Jim
"Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.",Dwight
Okay. Um... Got you something.,Jim
Don't want it.,Dwight
You don't know what it is.,Jim
Don't want it. Won't open it. Don't need it. Won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.,Dwight
"It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead. That would have made us even, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even Steven.",Jim
"No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes.",Dwight
"Angela, Roy's check. He's coming in later to pick it up.",Oscar
"Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.",Kevin
It was crazy.,Oscar
You saw it? Describe it please.,Angela
"Well, I heard some shouting. And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody. Jim says something. Roy stomps over there. All of the sudden, BAM. Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.",Oscar
Oh...,Angela
It was insane!,Oscar
[flustered] Well... good for Dwight.,Angela
"Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.",Michael
Where'd you get that?,Jim
Wikipedia.,Michael
"Wikipedia... is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.",Michael
"Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise.",Michael
"Hey, Mike. Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.",Jim
"Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl. I think... [mumbling softly] that maybe you should... [mumbling jibberish]",Michael
I can't hear you.,Jim
"What I'm saying is that, [continues to mumble jibberish]",Michael
Still nothin'.,Jim
"Ok, see what I did?",Michael
No.,Jim
"By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.",Michael
Nice.,Jim
"Ok, let's try another one. Um...",Michael
Okay.,Jim
Walking out of the room unexpectedly.,Michael
And what happens in this one?,Jim
It's a surprise.,Michael
Okay.,Jim
"Go ahead, ask me for a raise.",Michael
Can I have a raise?,Jim
[gets up and begins to walk out of the room],Michael
"[softly] Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.",Jim
What?,Michael
What?,Jim
"No, what did you say?",Michael
I didn't say anything. I was waiting to see what happened.,Jim
Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...,Michael
"I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.",Dwight
Which is where?,Toby
"Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area. Rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end.",Dwight
Thanks Dwight.,Toby
That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.,Kelly
I can't imagine what I would have done.,Ryan
I can. You would have left me to fend for myself. Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.,Kelly
"Well that was funny, that's why.",Ryan
Oh it was?,Kelly
Mm-hmm.,Ryan
"Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night...",Kelly
Okay.,Ryan
"...and you call me, to calm you down...",Kelly
You know what? I didn't---,Ryan
Can you stop...,Toby
"...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan. I'm not.",Kelly
"There's a bunch of people back here, maybe...",Toby
"Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...",Ryan
Guys...,Toby
I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!,Kelly
"I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly. But, if he did intend that? Wow. Genius.",Toby
[knock on door] Yeah.,Michael
You ready for me?,Darryl
"Yes, yeah, absolutely. Have a seat.",Michael
Cool.,Darryl
"You know what? Actually, let's go into the conference room.",Michael
Okay.,Darryl
"No, you know what? Let's stay here. No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.",Michael
Tactic number six. Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws 'em off.,Michael
"Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.",Michael
[long pause] I am declining to speak first.,Michael
"Okay, I'll start. It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise. I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.",Darryl
"Hmm. Ohh, Darryl. You are a good worker, and a good man. I just, you know, times are tight. And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.",Michael
Are you wearin' lady clothes?,Darryl
What?,Michael
Are you wearin' lady clothes? Those look like lady... pants.,Darryl
"No, this is a power suit.",Michael
That there's a woman's suit.,Darryl
[Darryl laughs] I do not buy woman's clothes. I would not make that mistake again.,Michael
"I'ma call Roy, man.",Darryl
Ohh... kay.,Michael
This is gonna make him feel better.,Darryl
All right.,Michael
This is too good.,Darryl
"Alright, you know what? Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?",Michael
"Oh my God, that's a woman's suit!",Pam
You're wearing a woman's suit?,Kevin
"No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK? I got this out of a bin.",Michael
"There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one. And it fit! So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least it's bisexual.",Michael
Who makes it?,Kevin
"Uh, [reading the inside of his jacket] MISSterious. And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.",Michael
"Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?",Phyllis
Okay.,Michael
Did you see...,Phyllis
"Would you stop it, please?",Michael
"So, none of that tipped you off?",Jim
"It's European, OK? It's a European cut.",Michael
"Michael, the pants don't have any pockets.",Pam
"No, they don't. See? [Michael lifts his jacket tail, sticks out his back side and shows Pam]",Michael
"[Laughing, covering her mouth]",Pam
Italians don't wear pockets.,Michael
It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.,Pam
"Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?",Karen
"No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.",Michael
"Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.",Darryl
"Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.",Michael
"Okay, can you just stand right there? [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.",Darryl
"Negotiations are all about controlling things. About being in the driver's seat. And make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore woman's clothes.",Michael
"Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?",Kevin
"I feel great, Kevin. Thank you.",Karen
You must have been scared out of your mind.,Stanley
"Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared.",Karen
"What happened, exactly? I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.",Angela
"Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.",Karen
Mm-hmm.,Angela
"And he's a big dude, you know? And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.",Karen
[flustered] Goodness.,Angela
"When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings. Roy just attacked him. I'm not sure which one Jim hated more.",Karen
Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.,Michael
"Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right? So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to. With Roy gone we got a smaller crew. And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.",Darryl
[mumbles jibberish],Michael
What? I can't hear you.,Darryl
[mumbling softly] That was a very good point.,Michael
"I can't--- what, Mike? Are you---",Darryl
[mumbling softly] You make a very compelling argument.,Michael
Sorry I almost got you killed.,Pam
"Yeah, that was nuts.",Jim
"He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with Roy and everything. I mean, what was I thinking, right?",Pam
"No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.",Jim
"Not anymore. It's, um... It's completely over now.",Pam
We'll see. I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.,Jim
Jim... I am really... sorry.,Pam
"Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it.",Jim
"I am going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.",Michael
Why can't I just... tell you?,Darryl
"Because, that is the way these things are done. In... films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide--- slide it, yes.",Michael
There you go.,Darryl
Oh. [scoffs] Come on. Be serious.,Michael
"I am serious, Mike. That's a 10% raise. That's what I want.",Darryl
"I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much.",Michael
"Come on, be for real Mike.",Darryl
I don't. Want me to prove it to you? There is... a pay stub.,Michael
[laughs] Are you serious? You're earning this?,Darryl
"Plus perks, yes.",Michael
"Mike, this is barely more than I make. You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]",Darryl
Fourteen years.,Michael
Ho-ho!,Darryl
"No, please, please...",Michael
"Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one. [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]",Darryl
"Ok, let's take 15, again.",Michael
"A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks. It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that.",Michael
"Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.",Jim
"When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?",Dwight
Boy I---,Jim
"No. And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?",Dwight
"It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming. But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel. I just can't grab onto him. It's infuriating.",Jim
Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.,Karen
"Well... yes, that's probably what it is. So what do I do?",Jim
Hmm... I don't know. Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.,Karen
"Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.",Kevin
"Oh, thank you.",Michael
Yeah. I heard you might need it. So...,Kevin
Here's the $40 you gave me.,Creed
I didn't give you $40.,Michael
In a way you did.,Creed
"Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes. I still think he's way overpaid.",Stanley
"[on cell phone] Fourteen years. Fourteen. I know. [laughing] Ok, alright. I gotta go. Later. [hangs up]",Darryl
"Okay. Okay, here's the straight... dope. No tricks. No Wikipedia.",Michael
What?,Darryl
"I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.",Michael
"That's 'cause of you, Mike. They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.",Darryl
Well what am I supposed to do?,Michael
"Get your own raise. You gotta get out there and earn, son.",Darryl
I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous.,Michael
"Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put",Darryl
[exhales] That's true.,Michael
"Yeah that's true. You gotta call your girl, and get paid. Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.",Darryl
You know what? I should.,Michael
"Yeah, you should.",Darryl
I have been a loyal employee for a long time.,Michael
Fourteen years long.,Darryl
You know what? I deserve a bump.,Michael
"Make it happen, cap'in.",Darryl
"I am makin' it happen, sergeant.",Michael
"I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11:30. Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what. I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car. [Angela rolls her eyes] Something like that. So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels. Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter---",Creed
You're useless.,Angela
"Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?",Jan
"No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I wanna do it today.",Michael
"Today. All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?",Jan
"Yshhyah. Um, yeah. I'll leave right away.",Michael
"Great. Uh, and listen. Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.",Jan
"Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.",Michael
Da--- Darryl from the warehouse?,Jan
Mm-hm.,Michael
"No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep. So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.",Jan
"Hey, I'd rather kill myself.",Michael
"Michael, he's your branch's HR rep...",Jan
"[talking over Jan] No, Toby is terrible. Toby is the worst human being I've ever known.",Michael
"...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship. You know this. Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.",Jan
[sighs] Fine.,Michael
You are so mean.,Kelly
I don't know what you're talking about.,Ryan
"Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard. You called me stupid.",Kelly
"No, I said your idea was stupid.",Ryan
"Toby, come on. Let's go.",Michael
Where?,Toby
"Where? I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go.",Michael
What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?,Kelly
Alright.,Toby
Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor.,Kelly
Don't you see why that's insane?,Ryan
"Oh, so I'm crazy now?",Kelly
"Comfortable, Mike?",Darryl
Yeah. Fine.,Michael
"How about you, man. Comfortable?",Darryl
No.,Toby
[imitating Chris Tucker] Don't ever touch a black man's radio! ...Chris Tucker.,Michael
Thank you.,Darryl
Well...,Michael
I haven't been to New York in a long time.,Darryl
"Mm, the Big Apple.",Michael
Maybe I'll stay overnight. Got a cousin lives down there.,Darryl
How would we get home?,Toby
Oh you could stay too. He's got a big place.,Darryl
Maybe I'll stay.,Michael
"Mm, it's not that big.",Darryl
Well...,Michael
"Busses, though. They get you home quick.",Darryl
"[mouth full of pretzels] Oh, I...",Michael
"And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like 'No!'",Kelly
Then what'd he do? [Kelly's phone rings],Angela
"You should just read the report that Toby did. He took everyone's stories. [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly. Oh yeah I could totally help you with that. Ok, let me just get the folder out. Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper. Oh, 12 reams...",Kelly
"Hey guys, Jan is ready for you.",Hunter
"Okay, bring it home now. And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.",Darryl
"Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.",Michael
Yes sir. Remember that. I'll be right outside if you need me,Darryl
All right.,Michael
"Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases. I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself.",Darryl
"[to Jim] Hey man, uh... I'm sorry. [Jim motions 'Don't worry about it'] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something?",Roy
I don't know.,Pam
"Please. I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly]",Roy
[as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out!,Kevin
"Thanks, Kev. I'm good though.",Jim
"Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello. Come in. [exhales] Ah, Okay.",Jan
Who's the boy toy?,Michael
That's my new assistant.,Jan
Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?,Michael
I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?,Jan
"Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.",Michael
"Hi, Jan.",Toby
"Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation. All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside. Are we clear?",Jan
Pippity poppity.,Michael
Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.,Jan
Six percent? After all we've been through?,Michael
"Oh, God.",Jan
I got you... jade earrings.,Michael
Michael---,Jan
No!,Michael
Michael---,Jan
"No. You gonna play it like this? You give me a good raise, or no more sex. [Toby begins to write] [to Toby] What are you writing, perv-ball?",Michael
Just preparing for the deposition.,Toby
This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior. It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.,Toby
"I'm so sorry, Pammy. I really wasn't gonna do anything. But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and... I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong.",Roy
"I'm sorry too. I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.",Pam
So you gonna start datin' Halpert then?,Roy
"Um... no. No, he has a girlfriend.",Pam
"Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy.",Roy
"No, there were a lot of reasons.",Pam
But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don't get you Pam.,Roy
I know.,Pam
What's this?,Dwight
What's what?,Jim
"Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department. 'Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man. Dwight K. Schrute'",Dwight
Wow. I guess word got around. That's a nice... honor.,Jim
Please. They hand these out to little kids. Look. There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.,Dwight
[under his breath] Didn't think you'd notice...,Jim
"Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart. This is me, Jan. This is me!",Michael
"Okay, Michael. Please, why don't we just take a break. This is really going nowhere.",Jan
"Okay, no, no, no, no. You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere.",Michael
"Ok, Toby, how about if you...",Jan
Sure.,Toby
Great.,Jan
What's wrong with you?,Jan
"Ohh. It was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then, your assistant, is all young and hot. And I---",Michael
"Okay, Michael. I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.",Jan
Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---,Michael
"No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it. Okay?",Jan
"Ah, so... All right, Levinson. Here's the rub. I would like a 15% raise.",Michael
No. But we can offer you 12.,Jan
But you just said 15.,Michael
"Negotiation is an art. Back and forth. Give and take. And today, both Darryl and I took something. Higher salaries. Win win win. But you know, life is about more... than just salaries. It's about perks. Like having sex with Jan--",Michael
Michael!,Jan
So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?,Stanley
"Mm-hmm, near the river.",Phyllis
"Mm, how many bedrooms?",Stanley
Four.,Phyllis
Dwight. Dwight. I've been doing some very interesting reading.,Angela
Really?,Dwight
Mm-hmm. Tales of bravery.,Angela
"Mm, good stuff.",Dwight
"Mm-hmm. I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.",Angela
"Sounds... fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees]",Dwight
"[scoffs] I... will never say a word. And now, we are even.",Jim
"I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell. On time. Now I'm back. Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it. [in a forceful voice] So look out Dunder Mifflin! [laughs] [snaps] I mean, look out... in a fun way! You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you...",Andy
"Hey guys! Guess who's back! [Dwight pepper-spray's Andy] AHHH! [screams in pain] OH, GOD!",Andy
No need to thank me.,Dwight
"I am not a hero. I am a mere defender of the office. You know who's a real hero? Hiro, from",Dwight
"Look, I am not a gazillionaire. I can't... I can't dress like Donald Trump dresses. I have to stay within the parameters of my budget. I can't shop at a fancy Norwegian boutique. I buy my suits the old fashioned way. I buy them from discount stores... or on eBay. And when I found out that Ross was having a midnight madness sale, I ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier. And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin. And I did too. And I grabbed this suit. And a woman, sort of a, I don't know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket. And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war. And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get. And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before. Um, anyway, she s... socked me, in the eye. And she got it, she got the suit. But, I went to the Ross, in Trenton New Jersey, and I found the exact same suit. And I didn't have to deal with Missy Elliot.",Michael
"Good morning, Pam.",Andy
"Oh, welcome back, Andy.",Pam
Drew. I'm Drew now.,Andy
Oh. Drew. Sorry.,Pam
Apology not... accepted. Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place. [laughs],Andy
"Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. [cut to shot of Andy punching a hole in the wall] But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back. And I've got a new attitude. And a new name. And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.",Andy
Mornin' Jim.,Andy
"Hey, Andy. How are you, man?",Jim
Good. Drew.,Andy
What's that?,Jim
Dr--- You can call me Drew.,Andy
"No, I'm not gonna call you that.",Jim
Cool. I can't control what you do. I can only control what,Andy
Andy.,Jim
Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight. How's it goin' man?,Andy
"Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.",Dwight
"Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.",Dwight
"Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.",Jim
"Ok, tell him that's not true.",Dwight
Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.,Jim
You guys...,Andy
"Ok, no. Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run. Jim! Tell him!",Dwight
"[half-heartedly] Andy! Nah, that's too far.",Jim
Damn you.,Dwight
"Today is Safety Training Day. Toby is leading ours upstairs. Yeauck. But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat. We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse. And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.",Michael
"Now, this is the forklift. You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine. That means the upstairs office workers",Darryl
Hmm.,Michael
Should you drive the forklift?,Darryl
"I can, and I have.",Michael
No! No no no no no! I said,Darryl
You're not allowed to drive the forklift.,Lonny
"It's not safe, you don't have a license.",Darryl
"Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift. [points] Pudge has driven the forklift.",Michael
Madge.,Madge
I thought your name was Pudge?,Michael
"No, it's always been Madge.",Madge
"Okay. Um, her.",Michael
"Her. Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine. You are not. Okay?",Darryl
"Ah, fine.",Michael
Do you understand that?,Darryl
Yeeesh.,Michael
"We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year. This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...",Darryl
"[barely keeping his composure] 'Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!' [laughs]",Michael
And I fell and busted my ankle. I'm legitimately scared for my workers.,Darryl
The baler can flatten a car engine. It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.,Darryl
Yeah!,Dwight
It's on!,Andy
How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?,Darryl
Bail'er? I hardly know her.,Michael
"Dammit, Michael. Pay attention, man.",Lonny
Anybody wanna take a guess? Anybody?,Darryl
Five bucks says it's over 50.,Kevin
You really wanna bet?,Jim
Anybody?,Darryl
"Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.",Kevin
How many?,Guy
"Ok, you're on.",Jim
"Ten people, Michael. Ten people. Would you like to be one of them?",Darryl
[mouths] Damn...,Kevin
"[in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...",Darryl
"No, don't worry about it. We'll just got double or nothin'.",Jim
On what?,Kevin
"I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out.",Jim
Nice.,Kevin
What are you guys talkin' about?,Oscar
"These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,",Darryl
"Yes, yes. But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody...",Michael
It would be the worst thing in the world! It would! Very much so.,Darry
What the,Lonny
It's a big red trash compactor!,Michael
What are you---,Lonny
It's not a trash compactor! It's a baler!,Darryl
Don't disrespect the baler!,Lonny
"Okay, okay! I got it. I got it. ... Only on the rarest of occasions...",Michael
No do not touch it!,Darryl
...would I go near---,Michael
"There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?",Darryl
"Toby now has the floor... and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life. Let me rephrase that. I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl. Here we go!",Michael
"Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome. It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour. For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.",Toby
"Yes, good. Fine. Like stretching and...",Michael
"Um, yeah. You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour.",Toby
"Wow, that is... that time really adds up. That's like... a half an hour, every hour?",Michael
Take them at the same time.,Darryl
"Ok, you know what? You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?",Michael
"No, no. Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.",Toby
What about a long sleeve T?,Ryan
"Well, that'll work.",Toby
Long johns? A shaw?,Kevin
"You know, anything that warms you.",Toby
"Ok, you know what? I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom. [to warehouse guys] Sorry, he is very lame. [takes book from Toby] Um, let's see. 'Seasonal affective disorder! A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter.'",Michael
Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.,Darryl
"Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, ain't it?",Lonny
"Ok guys, you know what? I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation.",Michael
"Actually, you did.",Darryl
"Yes. Okay, let's do another one. This is a good one. 'A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---'",Michael
Sedentary.,Toby
Yes. 'Which can contribute to heart disease.' Heart disease kills more people that balers.,Michael
"That's called having a fat butt, Michael.",Lonny
"Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary...",Michael
"Yeah, yeah. That's, that's fat butt disease. That's what you suffer from?",Lonny
No.,Michael
"Fat butt disease, Michael?",Lonny
"Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.",Kelly
"Yeah? I bet you'd like to swim with this sea monster, wouldn't you?",Lonny
Ryan?,Kelly
"Dude, tell your girl to shut up.",Lonny
What?!,Kelly
"Kelly, you insulted the gentleman. Please apologize.",Ryan
Are you kidding me?,Kelly
"Alright, we outta here.",Darryl
"Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours. So, I---",Michael
"Yeah, but ours was real, Michael.",Lonny
"That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike. It's serious down there. We do dangerous stuff, man. This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball. You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life. Sittin' on your biscuit. Never havin' to risk it.",Darryl
"Okay. ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?",Michael
"Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse. I worked in a warehouse. Men's Warehouse. I was a greeter. I'd like to see Darryl greet people. Probably make 'em feel like wimps. Not me, I... 'Hello, I'm Michael. Welcome to Men's Warehouse. We have a special on khaki pants today.' ... This is one example.",Michael
[Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten.,Kevin
"Really, ten? That's your guess? You're a professional accountant.",Oscar
There's like ten green ones.,Jim
Forty-two.,Oscar
I'm gonna say fifty.,Jim
Fifty-one.,Karen
"Oh, don't be that person.",Jim
That is lame.,Kevin
It's a strategy!,Karen
It's called being smart.,Pam
Thank you.,Karen

Damn it.,Kevin

That is not fair. He has spent hours up here at reception with you.,Kevin
"Okay, okay.",Jim
"No, constantly. Like, for",Kevin
Okay.,Jim
"Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?",Michael
I don't understand the question.,Pam
Working in an office can lead to depression. Which can lead to suicide. I mean this is really serious stuff.,Michael
Yeah...,Pam
"I--- I--- Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...",Michael
It's really hard to demonstrate depression. Their safety training had visuals.,Pam
"Yeah... you are... ah, so right. They had visual aids. And all we had were the facts. You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity. You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.",Michael
"So, you're okay?",Pam
Indubitably.,Michael
"They use props. They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.",Michael
"Idiots! God, what are we gonna do!?",Dwight
"I don't know, I don't know. Because you know what our killer is? Depression---",Michael
Wolves.,Dwight
Nn--- Depression.,Michael
Visual aids.,Dwight
Yes.,Michael
A quilt. Depression quilt?,Dwight
No time to sew a quilt. ... I got it. Give me the number for the Giant Big Box Toy Store.,Micheal
"You may be asking yourself, 'What am I doing on a trampoline?' Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day. Not! Here's the plan. Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar. Only this time, where's Michael? Oh my God! He is on the roof! Now I have got their attention. I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression. And then I say, 'Hey! You ever seen a suicide?' And I jump. And they freak out. And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes. Nice side note: They might think 'Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael.' But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun. I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da! [Dwight nods]",Michael
"So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue. So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc. And let's just say that I just sent back",Kelly
"I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money]",Ryan
You're such a ditz.,Kelly
"Ryan, well done. Two minutes, forty-two seconds. Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said 'awesome' 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.",Kevin
"[on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing! I'll go summon the troops!",Dwight
"Maybe we should test it first. Letterman-style. Throw a TV over, or...",Michael
We measured it once...,Dwight
Go buy some watermelons.,Michael
Seedless?,Dwight
Just...,Michael
[Creed takes a bite of an apple] Creed is eating an apple. I found a potato.,Toby
Hey Creed.,Pam
Hey!,Creed
Hey.,Pam
Hello. [Jim replaces Creed's apple with a potato][Creed takes a bite of the potato],Creed
Yes!,Pam
Here you go. [hands money],Kevin
Nice.,Toby
I don't know this place as well as I thought I did. I'm getting cleaned out.,Karen
Ready?,Dwight
Let's do it! Drop that sucker.,Michael
"[drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds]",Dwight
BINGO! WHOA WHOA WHOA! Oh... crap. Deactivate the car alarm. Clean up the mess.,Michael
Okay.,Dwight
"Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.",Michael
Got it.,Dwight
"Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.",Michael
We're not allowed to use the baler.,Dwight
"Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.",Michael
I'm on it!,Dwight
I'm temporarily lifting the shun.,Dwight
Thank you.,Andy
It means nothing. I need you to do something for me.,Dwight
Anything.,Andy
"Okay, calm down. I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.",Dwight
You mean a moon bounce.,Andy
What do you think? You've got an hour.,Dwight
I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash.,Andy
Shunning resumed.,Dwight
"Do you, do you want a drawbridge?",Andy
Un-shun. Yeah that sounds good. Re-shun.,Dwight
"Oh yeah, this is much better. Safer. Excellent decision.",Dwight
"Yes, thank you for seeing that.",Michael
"When you land, try and land like an eight year-old. These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.",Dwight
I don't know if I wanna do this.,Michael
Do you wanna do another test? I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!,Dwight
"No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking.",Michael
That's right! Doing! Totally doing! It's rock n' roll!,Dwight
Rock n' roll!,Michael
Yeah!,Dwight
That's right! I am not thinking.,Michael
[imitating the sound and playing an air guitar] Near near near near near!,Dwight
Yes! Yeah!,Michael
[singing] Michael is awesome! Jumpin' off the roof!,Dwight
Woo!,Michael
[singing] Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce! Show 'em who's boss!,Dwight
Woo!,Michael
[singing] Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!,Dwight
I am ready to do this! I am ready to make a point! [Dwight continues air guitar],Michael
"[out of breath] Guys! Listen up! Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!",Dwight
Whoa! What's the situation?,Andy
[hesitates] Un-shun. I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.,Dwight
"Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end?",Andy
Un-shun. Never. Re-shun. I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!,Dwight
Is it nice outside?,Stanley
It's gorgeous. Let's go!,Dwight
Do I need my jacket?,Stanley
"No really, it's, it's very nice. Come on!",Dwight
Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?,Ryan
"Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go! Let's go!",Dwight
"[outside] Come on, hurry up you guys!",Dwight
"[on the roof] My life! Oh, my life...",Michael
"[on megaphone] Michael, what's wrong?!",Dwight
"Everything's wrong. The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.",Michael
Depression? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?,Dwight
"Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year! According to a 2004 study!",Michael
Is that the last year the data was available?,Dwight
Yes! My head is in such pain! And turmoil!,Michael
Don't do anything rash!,Dwight
"Wait, where are the warehouse guys?",Michael
I didn't... [Dwight runs up to the side of the building] I didn't think you needed them for this part.,Dwight
Okay... that's...,Michael
you said to just...,Dwight
"That's the whole point, dummy.",Michael
"Okay, I'm on it!",Dwight
Okay.,Michael
Attention blue collar workers!,Dwight
What are the odds that this is in any way real?,Pam
"I'd say like... 10,000 to 1?",Jim
"Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds.",Kevin
"If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it. If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a",Kevin
Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!,Dwight
"Oooooh, my life!",Michael
Michael! What's wrong?,Dwight
"Everything is wrong, Dwight. The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.",Michael
Depressed? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?,Dwight
"Dwight, you ignorant slut.",Michael
"Well, you know, the first performance was a little off. But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show. Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.",Jim
"And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!",Michael
"Oh, excuse me. It's my... favorite part.",Jim
This is just offensive.,Angela
At least we're outside.,Ryan
"[zipping up his pants] Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.",Creed
"Oh my God, there",Jim
"No, there's nothing to see over there, people! There's nothing to see. ...They found the castle, Michael.",Dwight
Damn it.,Michael
"Oh... God. Oh my God, he's gonna jump.",Pam
"Oh. He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.",Jim
Yeah...,Pam
"Hey uh, Michael. Don't jump on the bouncy castle. You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured.",Jim
"Hey Michael! I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.",Pam
What is it?,Michael
Come down and... open it and you'll see.,Pam
"Dwight, find out what the present is.",Michael
"Okay, uh... I don't see anything. She might be bluffing.",Dwight
Dwight...,Jim
"Dwight, what are you---",Pam
"Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.",Dwight
"Dwight, you are such a liar. Pam, really, what is it?",Michael
"Mike, this is the opposite of safety. You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.",Darryl
"You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.",Michael
"Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.",Darryl
What do I have to live for?,Michael
"A lot... of things. Uh, you, uh... What about Jan? Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man. It's goin' good, right?",Darryl
"It's complicated with Jan. And I don't know where I stand, or what I want. The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be.",Michael
"Mike, you're a very brave man. I mean, it takes courage just to",Darryl
Do you really mean that?,Michael
I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong. And I ain't that brave.,Darryl
I'm braver than you?,Michael
Way,Darryl
I Braveheart. I am.,Michael
"Come down, okay?",Darryl
"Okay. Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.",Michael
"An office... is as safe as the people in it. And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office. That's the danger I found myself in today. I saved a life. My own. Am I a hero? I really can't say. But, yes.",Michael
"When people think of Andy, they think of hate and anger. When people think of Drew, they think of baked goods.",Andy
"Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor. How is that possible?",Kelly
They are the worst. Who's this Drew chick?,Kevin
Drew isn't a girl... She's Andy.,Phyllis
"Oh no, nobody likes my cookies. I'm so angry, argh I want to hit something. [laughs] Totally kidin' guys.",Andy
"Little device I learned to diffuse tension, be the first to make fun of yourself, because if they make fun of you before you do... Then you might lose your mind.",Andy
[pours the last of the coffee into his mug],Kevin
Ahhh... Is that the last of it?,Andy
I'm sorry.,Kevin
"It's OK. I can't always have what I want, but I can always want what I have.",Andy
"Well, would you like a cup of no coffee? 'Cause that's what we have.",Kevin
Is it fresh? [winks],Andy
Are you going to beat me up?,Kevin
Umm... [draws back arm] No. [laughs],Andy
"People don't need to be afraid of me. I can't achieve anger any more, and I have a new car. Toyota Prius, because Andy didn't care about fuel efficiency, but Drew has seen 'An Inconvenient Truth'. Nearly twice.",Andy
[walks around Andy's new car keying it],Angela
"OK, come on everybody, go time. Pam let's go.",Michael
I thought I'd stay and answer the phones.,Pam
"Don't worry Pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life... Your long lovely life. [whispers to camera] saved it.",Michael
Here we go.,Michael
Come on.,Dwight
Field Trip.,Michael
Step lively. Single file everybody.,Dwight
Like we're going to the science museum.,Michael
Let's single...,Dwight
Learn by touching.,Michael
Single... OK.,Dwight
I've been told that I'm a tactile learner.,Michael
"Buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy.",Dwight
"You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.",Kelly
"Totally, we should both work out.",Ryan
Screw you.,Kelly
"Kelly, Ryan looks great. You should be thankful that you...",Michael
"Sir, could you please, please focus on Darryl?",Larry
I...,Michael
Try.,Larry
Summing up.,Darryl
"Sum it up Darryl, sum it up.",Michael
"We got beat today, Dwight.",Michael
[sighs],Dwight
But it was not a fair fight.,Michael
"No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?",Dwight
It was the warehouse guys...,Michael
Right.,Dwight
"... Dwight, they embarrassed us...",Michael
Argh!,Dwight
... because they had a much scarier safety presentation.,Michael
Ghaaa!,Dwight
"You know what's funny? Robin Williams. [sighs] When a cat gets stuck in a washing machine. City Slickers. Talking like Borat. You know what's not funny? Safety, or making fun of the person trying to talk about safety. [in Borat voice] Not nice. I must show people how dangerous office can be. High five... Now that's funny.",Michael
How do you make depression sexy? How do you... How do you get people interested in depression? That is the conon... the conun... the conumbery,Michael
"Those warehouse guys, think that we are all flabby, middle management, nerf balls. Well I'm going to show them that we have nerfs of steel. [winks]",Michael
"[Michael, Andy, and Dwight are standing around a trampoline] You know guys, I recently learned some pretty cool stuff about the difference between feeling something and... acting on that thing.",Andy
Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please.,Dwight
"Yeah, Drew.",Michael
Yes bosses.,Andy
"You know Drew, why don't you go inside. Dwight come here. Where should we put this?",Michael
"OK, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go. Ready... Go! One Mississ... OK, you went that far on one Mississ. Ippi would take you to here. This trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three Mississippi, maybe three and a quarter. So one Mississ... correct... ippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... e. Right here.",Dwight
"OK, good. Thank you. Wanna take our time, do this right.",Michael
[phone rings] Hello? Hi Bob Vance. [laughs],Phyllis
That's three times in ten minutes.,Karen
Where's my five dollars?,Stanley
You are my little teddy bear. I wantcha.,Phyllis
"I always knew my co-workers were annoying. I never realized I could profit from it. Go ahead Bob Vance, call Phyllis, all day.",Stanley
"[Michael is up on the roof of the building] Michael, go ahead, we're listening.",Andy
"I'm going to wait. I don't want to say this twice, it's too painful and I'm too depressed.",Michael
"[talking through bullhorn] Michael, you can not fly, you can not, I've seen this too many times.",Creed
"Give me that thing, I want to try.",Kelly
"Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.",Jim
"I was just going to say that [yells toward Michael] you have a cute butt. Oh my God I did not just say that, did I just say that? Oh my God I'm so adorable.",Kelly
"I know the timings bad, but I hate to be a nudge, but there's stuff that he has to sign that needs to be mailed by four.",Angela
"OK, if he's not down by four, I'll get the papers up to him.",Dwight
"OK, it's three forty eight.",Angela
"OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.",Jim
"Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing.",Ryan
Come on.,Jim
"Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.",Stanley
Come on. He'll listen to you.,Jim
Come on Ryan.,Everyone
Let's do it.,Angela
Come on pretty boy.,Dwight
"Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.",Ryan
I will miss you the most Ryan.,Michael
"Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it.",Ryan
"Let me borrow that chief. Michael, you don't have to prove anything to anyone but yourself. So don't jump just to prove anything to us. OK? That said, if you need to prove something to yourself, you should jump.",Andy
Oh!,Jim
Up to you.,Andy
No no no!,Jim
"If you do jump, I want you to reach for the sky.",Andy
Hey!,Pam
"OK. careful, thanks. [takes bullhorn from Andy]",Jim
Grab a comet and kiss the moon! Kiss it!,Andy
See this is why you always take ten thousand to one. You never know.,Kevin
"You own a convertible. Come on man that's, that's hot. Women love that stuff right?",Darryl
"It's only leased, and it's got rust damage, he'll never get his deposit back.",Dwight
"Coal miners, crab fishermen, Dog the bounty hunter, all dangerous jobs. But also upper middle management. [takes deep breath] Wow! I could have fallen off a roof today... And you don't worry about falling off a roof when you work on a crab boat... And there are no roofs in coal mines.",Michael
"[in parking lot] Goodnight Stanley. [sees his car is keyed, just nods his head]",Andy
[Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question. What kind of bear is best?,Jim
That's a ridiculous question.,Dwight
False. Black bear.,Jim
Well that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought---,Dwight
Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.,Jim
Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!,Dwight
"Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses. Uh, four dollars. And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble. And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.",Jim
"You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk] Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!",Dwight
... MICHAEL!,Jim
"Oh, that's funny. MICHAEL!",Dwight
"[on phone] Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations?",Pam
[on phone] Absolutely. I couldn't be more sorry about this.,Jim
"[on phone] I know, I know. We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.",Phyllis
[on phone] I am upset. Don't I sound upset?,Stanley
"[on phone] It is disgusting. I totally agree. Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper.",Michael
"We have a crisis. Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock. Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing... unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like. I've never been a fan.",Michael
"Everybody in here. STAT. No time to lose. Cri-Man-Squa. F and C, doubletime.",Michael
Cri-Man-Squa?,Dwight
Crisis Management Squad.,Michael
"F and C, doubletime?",Ryan
Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go. Any other questions?,Michael
One more. Why are you talking like that?,Jim
"To save time, Jim.",Michael
Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.,Karen
"Yeah, she has a good point. I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.",Pam
You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh! Forget it. Where is Creed?,Michael
Here.,Creed
"Creed. Quality assurance. Your job. I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed. Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.",Michael
"Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill. And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.",Creed
"We have a lot of angry customers out there. This puts us at threat level midnight. Accounting, you are on customer service duty today.",Michael
That's really not our job.,Oscar
"Midnight, Oscar!",Michael
Kelly's training us?,Angela
This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S. This,Kelly
[getting a pill from the bottle] I don't have a headache. I'm just preparing.,Angela
"Jim, big fire in your house. Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper. Went home to all the kids.",Michael
"Yeah, I gotta call out on that.",Jim
"No, no, no, no. Not good enough. This is a keystone account. I want you in the school. In person.",Michael
All right.,Jim
I want you to bring a partner.,Michael
I'll go.,Ryan
"No, sweet cheeks. We need someone who's actually made a sale. Andy, you go.",Michael
"[English accent] William Dolittle at your service. A.K.A., Will Do.",Andy
"Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.",Jim
"No, no. I need two men on this. That's what she said. No time! But she did. NO TIME! Guys, get on this. Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.",Michael
Yes! You are entering the 'No Spin Zone!',Dwight
We're having a press conference?,Pam
"No, Pam. The press is just gonna find out by themselves.",Michael
Not! [scoffs],Dwight
"Here's the thing. When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference. Alert the media, and then you control the story. Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you. That's what happened to O.J.",Michael
"I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology. The press wants a story, I will give them a story.",Michael
"Oh, did the press ask for a story?",Jim
Here,Michael
"Yes, hello. Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton. I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there. And I'm trying to remember who it was. Mm-hmm. Who wasn't there last week? Debbie Brown. And which day was that? Wednesday, the eleventh. Perfect.",Creed
The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job. I will do whatever it takes to survive. Like I did... when I was a homeless man.,Creed
"Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people. But guess what? From now on, you guys are no longer losers! So give yourselves a round of applause. [Kelly and Kevin clap]",Kelly
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.,Oscar
"I know, right? Probably a lot.",Kelly
Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?,Angela
"OK, Angela. I love your enthusiasm. All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say 'Customer Service, this is Kelly!' Except don't say 'Kelly,' say your own name. Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name. Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation!",Kelly
"Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate?",Kevin
[in accent] Absolutely!,Kelly
"[in accent] 'ello, mate!",Kevin
[in accent] I like ice cream! I need a boyfriend.,Kelly
"[in accent] I like ice cream too, mate. Alligators and dingo babies.",Kevin
Beer me!,Andy
What's that?,Jim
Hand me that water. I always say 'Beer me.' Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time. So how's what's-her-name?,Andy
You know her name.,Jim
"Who, Karen? Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends. [takes swig of water] Mmm. How's the apartment hangin'?",Andy
It's fine.,Jim
"Nice. Check out this sunshine, man. Global warming, right? Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet.",Andy
What about music? Do you have any music?,Jim
"Uh, yeah. Should have said so. [sings] Rha-dah-dah-dah! Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul. I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay. Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--",Andy
"I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.",Jim
"Your call, dude. My girlfriend made an awesome mix. Beer me that disc.",Andy
"Lord, beer me strength.",Jim
"So, Tuna. When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay?",Andy
Did that,Jim
Well not everything a guy says needs to be said. Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation.,Andy
Whoa! What the--- Why is my girlfriend here?,Andy
"Oh, is she that teacher in the white?",Jim
"No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef.",Andy
Which one... is she?,Jim
The one in the green hoodie.,Andy
Wow.,Jim
"I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something?",Andy
"No, I don't think so.",Jim
"She's like, probably a tutor.",Andy
Nope.,Jim
She probably a t--,Andy
No.,Jim
Sh---,Andy
No.,Jim
"OK, press conference in 45. Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.",Michael

And obits.,Chad Lite
"Oh, dear God. OK, here are your credentials. You've been granted level three security clearance.",Dwight
Oh...,Chad Lite
"Don't get too excited, that's out of 20. Right this way. Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly. Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?",Dwight
"Uh, yeah, I'd like uh, uh---",Chad Lite
[shuts door on him] Great.,Dwight
"Oh, Andy. You know what? We don't have a",Jim
Jamie!,Andy
Andy--- Ohh...,Jim
What are you doing here?,Andy
Andy?,Jamie
Are you a student here?,Andy
Oh... yeah...,Jamie
You never told me you were in high-school!,Andy
This is weird. I... gotta go to Spanish.,Jamie
OH MY GOD!,Andy
Oh my God.,Jim
I had no idea.,Andy
Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.,Jim
Huh... We didn't do anything illegal. Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.,Andy
"[on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point. I'm sorry. No, I am",Kevin
"[on phone] Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale.",Oscar
"[on phone] Excuse me? Well, I don't see how that's our fault. And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up]",Angela
"OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing",Kelly
"When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.",Creed
Emergency dentist appointment.,Dwight
"Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu. I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there. We would have caught this.",Creed
"Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call. I'm so sorry. Bye.",Pam
"Hello, I'm looking for Michael Scott.",Barbara
"Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client. Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really.",Michael
"And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.",Michael
[snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this.,Dwight
"So, let us consider this matter ended.",Michael
Well it isn't ended. I'm... I'm very angry. I--- I could have lost business.,Barbara
"I know, I know you're angry. And we are truly, truly sorry.",Michael
I don't accept your apology. The watermark was obscene and horrifying.,Barbara
"Well, we are extremely sorry.",Michael
I don't accept.,Barbara
I'll be with you in a moment.,School Official
All right.,Jim
Who was that guy she was talking to? At her locker.,Andy
Not important. Because you're not dating her. Because it's a felony.,Jim
But who,Andy
Probably,Jim
The issue with the watermark is very serious.,School Official
Absolutely.,Jim
We teach our students that character counts.,School Official
And you should.,Jim
But---,School Official

"I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook. A full page, two words---",Andy
Good luck.',Jim
That's not what I had in mind.,Andy
Ask where he's from.,Kelly
[on phone] Where are you from? Ohio? That's nice. So what do you want? [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark.,Angela
"OK, great. Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.",Kelly
[on phone] It was an unfortunate error.,Angela
And you're sorry.,Kelly
"...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!",Angela
"We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.",Michael
"Well, it--- it doesn't help, because it already happened to me.",Barbara
The watermark... it's a one time thing.,Michael
I don't care! It was disgusting. Cartoon characters having sex?,Barbara
May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling.,Dwight
OK...,Michael
"I grew up on a farm. I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable. Goat on chicken. Chicken on goat. Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching. Whoever drew this got it exactly right.",Dwight
"What... can I do, for you?",Michael
"I, for starters, I think that you should resign.",Barbara
"Well... [exhales] OK, well... Um, wasn't really my fault. The guys at the papermill---",Michael
You're the head---,Barbara
The guys at the papermill--- No no no!,Michael
You're the head of the company!,Barbara
I'm,Michael
"Yes, and that makes it your responsibility---",Barbara
"No, I'm a regional manager---",Michael
And so you should lose your job!,Barbara
"No--- my--- OK, this is insane. You can get out of here. Get out!",Michael
Fine.,Barbara
That's insane. We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.,Michael
Mm-hmm.,Barbara
It's non-transferable...,Dwight
Doesn't matter. Out please!,Michael
I'm calling the Better Business Bureau.,Barbara
"Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! [to Chad Lite] Did you get all that?",Michael
Everything.,Chad Lite
"We gotta do something. [exhales] This is spinning out of control, Pam. This is just, not...",Michael
It's just the Scranton Times...,Pam
"No, then Newsweek picks it up. And then CNN does a story about it. Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...",Michael
You know what? I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.,Pam
You're right. It will blow over. But it's not... going to take... a week or two. [pulls out a video camcorder from his desk] Do you know what this is for?,Michael
Yes.,Pam
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. He says he needs a woman's touch.,Pam
"[Dwight is spraying far too much hairspray into Michael's hair] OK, I think that's good.",Michael
"Hello. I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that.'",Michael
"Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.",Dwight
That's how devoted I am to this job.,Michael
I'm just saying...,Dwight
I know.,Michael
They would flank you. Throw in a concussion grenade.,Dwight
"I understand that, Dwight.",Michael
"You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.",Dwight
"Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight? And now we're wasting tape. I'm gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut?",Michael
Cut.,Dwight
So I'll know where---,Michael
Cut.,Pam
"I'm asking Pam to do it, please.",Michael
Cut.,Pam
"OK, ready?",Michael
"Kevin, what's four plus seven?",Angela
[thinks] Eleven.,Kevin
"Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form.",Angela
"Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations. Oooh, yes. Facial.",Kevin
[laughs] Yes. [air high five],Oscar
You two are apes.,Angela
"I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.",Oscar
I'm sorry... that you're both morons.,Angela
"Oh, but you still said 'I'm sorry.'",Kevin
I called you morons.,Angela
Still said it.,Kevin
"Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]",Oscar
"Five, four, three. 'There is no way, I will resign. It wouldn't be fair. Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me. Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway. If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me. They're trying to make me an escape goat. If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it. The F-word. You have one day.'",Michael
One day for what?,Pam
That's... they always give an ultimatum.,Michael
OK.,Pam
"Good, cut?",Michael
Cut. That was your best apology video ever.,Pam
Thought so too.,Michael
[to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown. I thought maybe you'd like to sign it. Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her. She's got some children.,Creed
"I feel terrible about Debbie Brown. She got fired because of Dwight. So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times. Why do bad things always happen to the good people? It's tragic. Just tragic.",Creed
You want music?,Jim
I don't care.,Andy
"Come on man, just give it a couple days. I think you'll be all right.",Jim
Yeah.,Andy
"[singing the intro to The Lion King's 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...",Jim
You know what--- I don't---,Andy
"A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...",Jim
[Joins in with classic Andy falsetto] Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!,Andy
"A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...",Jim
Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!,Andy
"A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...",Jim
Sweet.,Andy
[walks in dressed as Jim] Pam.,Dwight
"Hey, Dwight. You look really nice today.",Pam
[scoffs] Pssssh. I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.,Dwight
"Hey, Dwight, lookin' sharp.",Karen
"Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert. Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?",Dwight
Do you?,Jim
No.,Karen
OK.,Jim
I'm good. Thanks.,Karen
[Dwight imitates the 'Jim face'] Look at that.,Jim
I'm Jim Halpert. [more horrible 'Jim faces'],Dwight
Spot on.,Jim
"Ah-luh-luh, a little comment. Muh.",Dwight
"Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day.",Kelly
"Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day.",Ryan
"The key to a crisis is dealing with it right away. Like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles. If you don't act fast, you will lose customers.",Michael
"Hello, CNN? I need to speak to your Scranton-area bureau chief? All right, then the bureau chief for the Greater Wilkes-Barre area? How about, ah, Lackawanna County. Okay, Northeastern Pennsylvania then. This is extremely urgent! No... you put",Dwight
Customer service isn't like accounting. It's not just typing numbers into a calculator and then it tells you an answer.,Kelly
We do a lot more than that.,Oscar
"Okay, or hand out checks, or whatever it is you do. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you think that people don't like you. But guess what, from now on you guys are not losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.",Kelly
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer phone calls.,Oscar
The annex rocks. All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you're sorry. Do that and you'll be fine. Make sense?,Kelly
Mm-hm.,Angela
"Okay, role-playing time!",Kelly
"Alright, I think I'm trained.",Angela
"Ooh, can I be a pirate?",Kevin
[hums],Creed
Hello.,Chad Lite
Hey!,Creed
"Excuse me. You're Creed Bratton, guitar player for Grass Roots in the late 1960s.",Chad Lite
I am indeed. How'd you know that?,Creed
I wrote your obituary.,Chad Lite
"Oh, oh that's right! Good work. Thank you very much, sir [shakes hand].",Creed
"About 10 years ago, for tax reasons, I faked my own death. I've been collecting benefits as my own widow ever since.",Creed
"Oh, my God!",Andy
"Oh, my God! Wow.",Jim
I had no idea.,Andy
Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.,Jim
How could I not have realized?,Andy
She looks older.,Jim
"Yeah, she does, doesn't she?",Andy
No.,Jim
"She acts older, too. She knows everything about European history, and photosynthesis, and she made me this lanyard with, like, a Fimo clay thing. She's a real Renaissance woman.",Andy
Or a high school girl. Let's go [mouths 'wow' to the camera].,Jim
Chicken pot pie.,Andy
What's that?,Jim
"That's what I was eating, in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven for dinner. And I got out of the car to shake the crumbs off my shirt, and this smoking hot woman comes up and we strike up a conversation.",Andy
Oh. You don't have to tell me this.,Jim
She lets me buy her and her friends some wine coolers for a dinner party she's going to.,Andy
You shouldn't be talking about that.,Jim
"I threw in some scratch tickets, 'cause generous guy, and next thing you know we're making out in the woods.",Andy
Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.,Jim
"No, we were really making out in the woods.",Andy
"No, can't help you now.",Jim
I gotta go talk to her.,Andy
No. D-,Jim
"With dissatisfied clients, it doesn't matter what you did. All they wanna hear is that you're sorry. They're like women that way. And this client is a woman. So when I say I'm sorry, it will be twice as effective.",Michael
So we're good?,Michael
"No, we're not.",Barbara Allen
I'm sorry.,Michael
"Well, okay. But I don't accept.",Barbara Allen
[whispering] Say you're sorry times infinity...,Dwight
Okay.,Michael
...'cause there's no comeback for that.,Dwight
All right. We are infinitely sorry.,Michael
I'm still furious.,Barbara Allen
You understand? You... you get this check.,Michael
Mmm.,Barbara Allen
Can I help you?,Spanish Teacher
"Yeah. I'm Mr. Bernard Johnson, MD. I'd like to talk with Jamie about a certain heart condition. Diagnosis: broken.",Andy
"Get out of here, Andy.",Jamie
Who's this guy?,Andy
My boyfriend.,Jamie
You're such a liar.,Andy
"Sir? You need to get out of here, before I call the police, okay?",Spanish Teacher
"Yeah, maybe you should call the police. See whose side they take. Warning, most cops are dudes.",Andy
"Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.",Jim
What?,Spanish Teacher
"I don't believe in apologies. When someone in the yakuza makes a mistake, they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger. And in that way, save face. And knowing the Japanese, they probably get an even better prosthetic finger. With a knife you can take out of it, or a screwdriver or a corkscrew.",Dwight
Why am I getting all of the bad ones?,Angela
Why can't you just say you're sorry and make them feel better?,Kelly
"I'm not gonna lie and say I'm sorry when the company didn't do anything wrong. That's immoral, and this is ridiculous.",Angela
"Would you, please? Please.",Oscar
"Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you're old enough to be my mother.",Kelly
"What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you're a slut and everyone thinks so.",Angela
"Well, you're fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela.",Kelly
Gladly. I quit.,Angela
"If cartoon characters didn't have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles]",Kevin
The customer is always right. Mrs. Allen was our customer. She was wrong. Is that a contradiction? No. Because she's not our customer anymore.,Michael
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. My favorite is the one for his mother.,Pam
"Hey, Mom. Happy birthday, belatedly. Sorry I forgot. I had put it on my calendar and Pam threw that out.",Michael
My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association.,Pam
"And without denying the seriousness of the situation, I would just like to remind you that in much of the Netherlands, swimming naked is the norm. So in Norway, you'd be the weirdos.",Michael
"Okay, Andy, we need to go. Seriously.",Jim
"Dude, there she is. Don't look, don't look. She's sitting with Denise. How am I supposed to do this? Denise hates me.",Andy
Don't do it.,Jim
"What is your problem, man? Can't you support a bro? That's why you don't have any friends, Tuna. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I need...",Andy
That's okay.,Jim
...your help. I love her.,Andy
What?,Jim
"Yeah. I lo- I love her. Is this what love is? This, like, horrible feeling in my stomach?",Andy
"No, that's your conscience. Listen to it.",Jim
"Look, okay, just be my wingman. Beer me five minutes. Talk to Denise. She's really into White Russians and whippets.",Andy
"Jamie, can I talk to you for a second?",Andy
Yeah. I only have a minute.,Jamie
"[sits down next to Denise] So, high school.",Jim
Do you have a cigarette?,Denise
"Oh, I don't smoke. Sorry.",Jim
There's nothing to do in this town.,Denise
You should take up a musical instrument.,Jim
"Yeah, I should take up that. Jamie?",Denise
"Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right?",Jim
"He's dead. Hey, do you have any weed?",Denise
"No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?",Jim
How old are you?,Denise
How old do you think I am?,Jim
Forty?,Denise
[shakes head],Jim
Are you someone's dad here?,Denise
Not that I know of.,Jim
Ew. What kind of car do you have?,Denise
I drive a Saab station wagon.,Jim
My dad just gave me his old Lexus.,Denise
"Really? Way to earn it. Hey, Andy?",Jim
What?,Andy
Yup.,Jim
Very well [hangs up phone]. I just got a call from Debbie Brown over at the mill. She claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself.,Dwight
"No time. Dwight, I love Debbie Brown. She's a close personal friend. But quality is my life. This company has a reputation to uphold. As much as it pains me, someone has to be held accountable.",Creed
You're right. Mercy is for girl-babies. Time to put this dog down.,Dwight
Are we ready?,Michael
Final touch-ups.,Dwight
Okay. Am I shiny?,Michael
Yeah.,Dwight
"Okay. We good? Okay, that's enough Aqua Net.",Michael
I don't know...,Dwight
[clears throat] Stop it.,Michael
[coughs],Dwight
"Hey, Angela. I'm sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don't know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it's no excuse. So, I'm very sorry.",Kelly
"Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn't called you stupid.",Angela
Do you think I'm a slut?,Kelly
"No, but some of your outfits are not appr-",Angela
Apology accepted! [hugs Angela],Kelly
I didn't apologize.,Angela
We're like best friends now!,Kelly
We're not.,Angela
I'll text you!,Kelly
Don't!,Angela
"Bye, Angela!",Kelly
Fine.,Angela
"That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she'll be less of a grump.",Kelly
Kelly's not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes].,Angela
"I have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign. Calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike. Well let me tell you something, something from the heart. I will not resign. I need this job. My mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month. With this job, I can barely cover that. I have a company car, but I still have to pay for gas, and gas prices are high. And I have no savings whatsoever. And it wasn't even me. It's so not fair that they want me to resign.",Michael
"...to the fullest extent of the law [hangs up phone]. Listen up, everyone! I just got off the phone with the mill. Final responsibility for Watermark-gate has been assigned. Floor manager Debbie Brown has officially been terminated. Lets give a big hand to Creed Bratton, without whose earnest and diligent sleuthing this scandal might never have been resolved [claps].",Dwight
"Just doing my job, guys.",Creed
[to Pam] Hey.,Jim
"[Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this?",Jim
That is a demerit.,Dwight
"[reads demerit] 'Jim Halpert, tardiness.' Ugh. I love it already.",Jim
"You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.",Dwight
"Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?",Jim
[scoffs] Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.,Dwight
Lay it on me.,Jim
Three demerits and you'll receive a citation.,Dwight
Now that sounds serious.,Jim
"Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.",Dwight
Which would be me.,Jim
That is correct.,Dwight
"OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.",Jim
What's a dis... what's that?,Dwight
"Oh, you don't want to know.",Jim
"[door opens] Hey, Phyllis. You all right?",Pam
I think I just got flashed.,Phyllis
What? Really?,Pam
In the parking lot.,Phyllis
"Oh, my God.",Pam
[jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move!,Dwight
"OK, I'll call the",Jim
What happened? What can I do to help?,Andy
[on the phone] OK.,Jim
I'll check the web.,Andy
[on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.,Jim
[to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?,Pam
"Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.",Phyllis
Phyllis. You're a married woman.,Angela
"The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss?",Creed
"If that's flashing, then lock me up.",Creed
"[whispering] It's just, like, so creepy.",Pam
[whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering],Ryan
What's happening?,Michael
"Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.",Pam
Really? Is she OK?,Michael
"Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.",Pam
"OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher]",Michael
What is so funny?,Angela
"Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?",Michael
I'm guessing not.,Kevin
[laughing softly] I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.,Michael
"Mm... not really, no.",Jim
It's disgusting and demeaning.,Pam
"Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone]",Michael
"Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the...",Toby
What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down],Michael
What's going on?,Toby
"Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh... [laughs]",Michael
I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response.,Toby
"Oh, come on. We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.",Michael
I don't think the women in this office -,Toby
"Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher.",Michael
I was at a parent-teacher conference.,Toby
"Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.",Michael
"In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me.",Michael
"[on speakerphone] Michael, ...",Jan
Huh?,Michael
"...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.",Jan
I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -,Michael
"I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.",Jan
"Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.",Michael
$300?,Jan
"I... uh, well, I don't know.",Michael
"You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?",Jan
"[on speakerphone] You got it, Jan.",Hunter
"Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.",Dwight
[exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.,Michael
Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.,Dwight
OK.,Michael
"[lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.",Dwight
This is the last,Michael
Look at that one.,Dwight
"Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand]",Michael
"Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.",Michael
"Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.",Dwight
[raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?,Jim
"Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?",Dwight
Phallus?,Pam
"Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.",Dwight
"I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.",Pam
I didn't really get a good look.,Phyllis
That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.,Pam
"Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] 'Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute.' This is ridiculous.",Karen
Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.,Dwight
"Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.",Karen
Desperate times call for desperate measures.,Dwight
"[reads memo] 'Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.' Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]",Pam
"OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.",Michael
"Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.",Karen
"See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?",Michael
"Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?",Dwight
"No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation.",Michael
"Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?",Jim
"Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?",Michael
"[eating banana] Mm, less than three.",Dwight
That is not current.,Michael
You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.,Dwight
Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.,Jim
Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.,Dwight
You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.,Michael
"I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.",Michael
"Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?",Creed
"Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.",Michael
I don't remember doing that.,Meredith
What a surprise.,Angela
"OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.",Michael
Alien,Dwight
"What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.",Michael
"If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.",Andy
"Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.",Kevin
What you're saying is extremely misogynistic.,Karen
"Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.",Michael
I'm saying that you're being sexist.,Karen
No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.,Michael
That - it's the same thing.,Karen
Michael.,Phyllis
Yes.,Michael
"When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.",Phyllis
Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.,Michael
"And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.",Angela
I have to know whether you're serious or not.,Michael
I wish I could menstruate.,Dwight
"If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.",Dwight
Can we just get back to work?,Karen
"Ye - OK, yes.",Michael
This is not work talk.,Angela
"You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps]",Michael
"Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that.",Karen
Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.,Angela
"OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go!",Michael
Have you finished with the sketch?,Dwight
Yeah.,Pam
"Hmm, doesn't seem like the type.",Dwight
"Uh, Phyllis got a good look.",Pam
Hmm.,Dwight
"[Pam's sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.",Dwight
[tires screeching] Oh.,Pam
"Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.",Angela
Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window],Meredith
"Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter.",Pam
"My car, my rules.",Meredith
"Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?",Kevin
"No. Thank you, though.",Jim
You aren't curious?,Kevin
Not really. I've seen a bathroom before.,Jim
"Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy.",Kevin
I think you mean a girl's,Jim
[quietly] Yeah. I'm going in.,Kevin
Go crazy.,Jim
[in women's bathroom] Oh... my... God.,Kevin
I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.,Andy
"Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.",Dwight
This guy looks like a real deviant.,Andy
"No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.",Dwight
"Aye, aye, Cap'n.",Andy
"More like, 'Aye, aye, General.'",Dwight
[Meredith parking the car] I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it - [metal scraping],Michael
It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.,Meredith
Many women,Michael
[marks Scranton with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we,Dwight
"[in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.",Jim
Yes.,Kevin
"Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight?",Toby
Anna Maria's.,Jim
What's the occasion?,Ryan
Six-month anniversary. What?,Jim
"Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.",Ryan
"No, we've been dating for six months.",Jim
"Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -",Ryan
"Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.",Jim
I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.,Ryan
All right. Hope nobody's on a diet.,Michael
"Thanks, Michael.",Kelly
"Thank you, Michael.",Angela
"You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish.",Michael
What do you want to dish about?,Pam
"Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it 'shmear?' Like the cream cheese.",Michael
"OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?",Pam
"Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.",Kelly
"What, um... what do you think of role-play?",Michael
"Oh, it can be fun.",Phyllis
"Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.",Michael
It's a pretty common one.,Karen
I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.,Michael
OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.,Angela
"Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.",Angela
"Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.",Pam
Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.,Michael
"Oh, my God.",Pam
[groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.,Michael
That is not healthy behavior.,Karen
"No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.",Michael
"Michael, you need to get out of this.",Pam
"No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.",Michael
"No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying]",Pam
"No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. [sniffing] You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]",Michael
Read the pros first.,Pam
"OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.",Michael
She does have very nice clothes.,Phyllis
"OK, OK. Um, cons.",Karen
Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested.,Michael
What was the last one?,Pam
She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.,Michael
"No, the one before that.",Phyllis
I'm unhappy when I'm with her.,Michael
Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.,Pam
I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.,Michael
"Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.",Karen
"Yeah, that's smart.",Michael
Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.,Pam
That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.,Michael
"I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?",Phyllis
I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.,Michael
My mom taught me that.,Phyllis
"Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.",Michael
No one said it has no calories.,Pam
"Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria's Secret] Come on. Get in here.",Michael
"Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.",Michael
"[in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.",Kevin
I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.,Toby
What are you doing in here? This is the women's room.,Creed
You're in here.,Kevin
I pay for that privilege. [goes into stall],Creed
[all get up to leave] OK.,Kevin
[wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.,Creed
"Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.",Michael
Phyllis. What do you think? Too much?,Karen
Jim's gonna love it. [Karen giggles],Phyllis
I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.,Pam
[in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.,Angela
"Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply] It's Jan. What do I do?",Michael
Answer it.,Karen
Don't answer it.,Pam
"OK, it stopped.",Michael
[bang] Whoa.,Kelly
[tires screeching] Crap.,Meredith
[snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.,Jim
"Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?",Kelly
"Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...",Michael
"Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.",Pam
"Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the... all right. [tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts]",Michael
I think I've got it.,Pam
Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?,Michael
"I don't think we really need that, Michael.",Pam
Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.,Michael
"You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming!",Pam
Think we'll find him?,Andy
"Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests.",Dwight
[pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies?,Andy
No. Wholesies. [snatches the candy bar],Dwight
"Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.",Andy
Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar],Dwight
"Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.",Andy
"You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs]",Dwight
"OK, I am really going to do this.",Michael
"Good luck, Michael.",Pam
"You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it. [sighs]",Michael
"OK, remember, be strong.",Karen
I love you guys. Now I'm getting her voicemail.,Michael
Don't leave a -,Pam
"[leaving a message] Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. [Jan walks in] OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.",Michael
"Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry.",Jan
Thank you.,Michael
So... we're good?,Jan
Abso-fruit-ly.,Michael
"[cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.",Jan
No... No...,Michael
"One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?",Jan
Yeah.,Michael
"OK. [voice on phone] 'It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...'",Jan
"Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] '... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -' [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] 'who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy.'",Michael
Oh. [door closes],Jan
"[sighs] Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. 'Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?' You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.",Michael
"[phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.",Dwight
"Hey, Dwight. It's Jim.",Jim
"Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy.",Dwight
"No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.",Jim
Ugh. I'm hanging up.,Dwight
Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.,Jim
You have information about the sex predator?,Dwight
I saw him two minutes ago.,Jim
Where?,Dwight
"In the women's bathroom, above the sink.",Jim
"[hangs up and runs to the women's bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM!",Dwight
So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?,Jan
Love it.,Michael
"Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?",Jan
"Uh, yes, I am.",Michael
"Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it?",Jan
"Uh, yeah, it's okay. Its just, I don't think the cartoons are very funny.",Michael
"Wait, wait, what cartoons?",Jan
"The a cartoon that goes with each article. This one says Mel Karmazin? I don't, I don't know. I guess I get it.",Michael
[Sigh],Jan
We should really start recycling.,Michael
"Right uh, Michael.",Jan
"Hey, what's going on?",Kelly
Phyllis got flashed in the parking lot.,Stanley
[Screams],Kelly
"Okay, you need to stop that right now.",Stanley
"Phyllis, you okay? You sure?",Bob
"Hey good lookin', what ya got cookin'?",Andy
"I got nothing cooking, it's cooked. It's borscht and its served cold.",Dwight
"Hey listen, I'm sure everyone's already told you but, your presentation out there, was pretty inspiring stuff. Must be nice being a woman around here, knowing they have a protector in you.",Andy
"If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it. Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.",Dwight
"Borscht, according to Dwight it's best served cold. You know what else is best served cold? Yeah, gazpacho. You see what I'm doing? I am establishing a mutual love of cold soups. This is the first step in my plan to win Dwight's trust.",Andy
I should make you my vichyssoise.,Andy
I will never be your vichyssoise.,Dwight
"Orgasms, why can women have them? Yep?",Michael
"No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.",Jim
"Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman. I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see. And, um, it's uncomfortable. So maybe I do understand.",Michael
"[sings] We're going to the mall. Bye Ryan, bye.",Kelly
"Lets go, fall out, let's go. Move, move, move, move, move.",Dwight
I got shotgun. Damn it.,Michael
"Let me be clear. There's only one thing that's important to me, and its not friendship. Its dominance, and I think I know a thing or two about dominating. Okay, I lived with a dominatrix for three years in Stamford. Mistress Lila. Taught me more than any college professor I ever had, while attending Cornell, which is where I went to school.",Andy
Look at that! Come on! Free underwear!,Michael
"It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand...",Pam
"Hey, Pam, how bout something like that for you. Could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section. Just show off the twins a little bit.",Michael
That's pretty cool.,Jim
You can make people believe anything. Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups. Why? I don't know. I don't have to know. That's what makes me so dangerous.,Andy
Idiot.,Michael
"I learned a lot about women today. And any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. Jan and I broke up. Why? Because she didn't like one message I left on her voicemail? But that is her peariagative. I thought I understood women, but maybe, can't believe I'm gonna say this, maybe, women don't understand themselves.",Michael
Ughh... Blech.,Michael
"OK, where does it hurt?",Dwight
Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...,Michael
"No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.",Dwight
Right there. [Michael points to computer screen.],Michael
[reading from screen] 'Abdomen. Menses.',Dwight
Maybe.,Michael
The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.',Dwight
Not it. I don't have eggs.,Michael
"About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.",Pam
"Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?",Dwight
That's possible.,Michael
Michael?,Pam
Uh-huh?,Michael
David Wallace is on line one.,Pam
The CFO? Ohh...,Michael
"OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.",Michael
"To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?",Michael
"[on phone] Michael, I am calling---",David
And Gromit. [David sighs] Jan? Is Jan there?,Michael
Jan is out of town right now.,David
"Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...",Michael
Michael?,David
...you just gots to get your freak on.,Michael
Michael?,David
Yeah.,Michael
Michael?,David
Hmmm.,Michael
I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.,David
Really?,Michael
Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.,David
Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.,Michael
That's not necessary.,David
May God guide you in your quest.,Michael
Yes.,David
"OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.",Michael
"Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely",Meredith
"Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?",Michael
"I don't wear a Speedo, Michael.",Oscar
"Well, you can't swim in leather pants. [laughs] I'm just yankin' your chain. Not literally.",Michael
Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30.,Toby
"Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going.",Michael
It's Beach Day...,Toby
"Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.",Michael
I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck.,Michael
"Hey, want my sun screen?",Toby
"Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece.",Pam
Uh-huh.,Toby
Thanks Toby.,Pam
"Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you",Michael
I thought we were just having fun at the beach.,Pam
"We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.",Michael
What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.,Michael
You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?,Pam
"I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?",Michael
"I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day?",Pam
This way to the partay bus.,Michael
I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.,Kevin
"[singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.' [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.",Kevin
"Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.",Michael
"Oh, sweet mother of God.",Stanley
"If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.",Michael
Excuse me?,Stanley
"Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus. Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities! And there is a special secret prize for the winner!",Michael
Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.,Dwight
"Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.",Michael
I hope there will be management parables.,Dwight
"Well, [whispering] Hey Pam, did you get that down?",Michael
Like what?,Pam
Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...,Michael
"Well... no, I don't... exactly... what?",Pam
Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures. [sighs] Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.,Michael
Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. [Gets off bus] Watch out for snakes!,Michael
Everyone put on sunscreen.,Angela
"Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in. [everybody sits down on beach] OK, everybody up! Circle 'round. [motions for circle to form] Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.",Michael
What?,Oscar
"Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.",Michael
Yes!,Dwight
Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.,Michael
"Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.",Michael
I choose Michael!,Dwight
I'm not playing.,Michael
"OK, temp.",Dwight
"Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.",Michael
We are going to choose team names. Dwight?,Michael
We will be called Gryffindor.,Dwight
Really? Not Slytherin?,Jim
"Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.",Dwight
"I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.",Jim
He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that.,Dwight
"[starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!",Jim
"OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.",Dwight
"Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?",Michael
I don't care what you call my team.,Stanley
Then I will name your team the Red team.,Michael
"No [crosses arms], the blue team.",Stanley
I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.,Michael
We will be team U.S.A.,Andy
"Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.",Michael
Andy Bernard. Pros: He's classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don't really trust him.,Michael
It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.,Michael
"There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.",Stanley
"Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go! [contestants start walking]",Michael
"Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh...",Oscar
Thank you so much. [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle],Stanley
"Phyllis is out. Yes! [to Kelly] Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good. [Cheers]",Andy
I don't want to hit the big rock!,Kelly
Don't worry. You're not...,Andy
I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.,Kelly
No where near the big rock.,Andy
[takes off blindfold] I just don't want to get hit by it...,Kelly
"What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified.",Andy
I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! [throws a stone],Andy
"[to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole.",Jim
Hole?,Karen
"Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.",Jim
[to Ryan] Come on! Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!,Dwight
"Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.",Ryan
What are you saying?,Dwight
You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.,Ryan
"OK, I apologize for yelling at you.",Dwight
That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.,Ryan
I am trying to bring team spirit.,Dwight
"[to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!",Jim
[lifts up blindfold] Oh my God! You ass! [chases Jim and throws egg at him] [both laugh],Karen
"There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking. [holds up notes]",Pam
[off screen] Pam...you're missing things. [shakes off hand and starts writing in notebook],Michael
[at Ryan holding egg in spoon] Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard! [Ryan takes off blindfold and throws it to ground along with egg and spoon] What the? Damn it temp!,Dwight
"[begins to clap] Great job everyone, that was fantastic. [Michael sighs]",Andy
"Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.",Michael
Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?,Pam
"Smart as a whip! Yes! [holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.",Michael
When's the contest?,Pam
Like umm...[looks at watch] ten minutes?,Michael
How am I supposed to... get...,Pam
Thanks a bunch.,Michael
A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.,Michael
"OK, who's hungry [Kevin starts to put hot dog in mouth] No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest. [sighs at the table] For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.",Michael
Can I have a turkey burger?,Kelly
"No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?",Michael
Turkey is a healthy meat.,Oscar
It's very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table],Dwight
"Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!",Michael
Is there any mustard?,Phyllis
"No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily.",Michael
"Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.",Michael
[eating hot dog] What is it?,Meredith
I can't say.,Michael
"You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?",Jim
"The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.",Michael
Can we just take those first two things?,Kelly
The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?,Michael
You're leaving?,Dwight
I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.,Michael
[slams fist onto table] I am so hungry! [starts eating hot dog real fast],Andy
Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?,Stanley
[points at Stanley] Word. [Stanley starts eating hot dog] There we go. Let's see it.,Michael
I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!,Stanley
"Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!",Michael
Team U.S.A.!,Kelly
One came up.,Andy
"13 hot dogs, everybody!",Michael
Damn it!,Dwight
[holding a fish with all the meat stripped off] Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs!,Creed
Sabotage.,Dwight
What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?,Angela
No. I was saying that before. Not now. Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.,Dwight
I knew you were saying sabotage. I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.,Angela
"If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.",Dwight
It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.,Michael
"Uh, we don't have any safety mittens",Stanley
Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright. It's alright. Here we go.,Michael
Get 'em big boy!,Karen
"Aaaaaand, go!",Michael
"C'mon, Jim!",Karen
"[growly noises, Jim looks terrified]",Stanley
What are you doing?,Jim
"Nice, Stanley!",Michael
[to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.,Stanley
Yeah. No. Good.,Jim
"Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.",Jim
If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway. I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.,Oscar
[Andy and Dwight sumo wrestle] Gaaaaa....,Dwight
One. Two. Three.,Michael
Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!,Dwight
Excellent!,Michael
Gryffindor! Gryffindor!,Dwight
I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.,Andy
That's not why you lost.,Dwight
Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.,Andy
"Yeah, right.",Dwight
"Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle]",Andy
[bouncing off of Andy] Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?,Dwight
"[Trying to wet bandana, falls in water] Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!",Andy
"What, Andy? Andy, what should I tell them?",Angela
"Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously!",Andy
I don't understand what you want from me.,Angela
"Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it!",Andy
"Sorry! Bye, Andy!",Angela
Angela!,Andy
"I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points?",Michael
"I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units.",Pam
Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.,Michael
"I really doubt it, Michael.",Pam
Please just check.,Michael
"[on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.",Jim
"Hello? Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well.",Karen
In well?,Jim
As well.,Karen
How would that work in well? I just want to know.,Jim
"Yes. uh, huh.",Karen
Wait a minute.,Jim
That would be fine.,Karen
"If this job is in a well, I don't want it.",Jim
[whispering] Cut it out!,Karen
I don't!,Jim
What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.,Michael
"How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.",Stanley
"Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!",Michael
Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.,Michael
Are you going to try it?,Kevin
I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.,Angela
"Angela, it is a million degrees.",Kevin
"I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?",Pam
"No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.",Michael
I'd like to try it.,Pam
Pointless.,Michael
But I'm not kidding. I really want to do it.,Pam
"Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up.",Michael
Nope.,Jim
Ji.. why not? C'mon.,Michael
"Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.",Jim
You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.,Michael
That's harsh.,Jim
Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.,Michael
"[lying in water, car lights light up his location] Hello? Who's there? My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin. Hello?",Andy
Why don't you go Michael?,Kevin
Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.,Michael
"And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.",Jim
"Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay. [clears throat, breathes noisily] The mind has to wrap around the foot. [exhales] Okay.",Michael
Do you want us to count to three?,Pam
"Yes. Count to three, please.",Michael
Three. Two. One.,Group
"Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.",Michael
"One. Two. Three! Go! Do it! Go, Michael.",Group
Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?,Michael
On the go that's after three.,Creed
Okay.,Michael
"One, two, three, go!",Group
No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.,Dwight
"Don't, don't.",Michael
[walking on coals] I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!,Dwight
"Wow. Go, Dwight. Keep moving.",Group
"[standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB! GIVE ME THE JOB!",Dwight
I'm not going to give it to you.,Michael
"[falling on his knees, then on all fours] Aaagh, aaagh!",Dwight
[yelling excitedly for Dwight to get off the coals],Group
"Michael, do something!",Pam
"Aggggh, that stings!",Dwight
"Being the boss is also about image. I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. 'Outside Hire.'",Michael
Or Mrs. 'Outside Hire.',Angela
"Yeah. Ummm, hmm... True. Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.",Michael
Who's Bob Hope?,Kelly
God! He's a comedian.,Michael
"Oh, like Amanda Bynes.",Kelly
Who's Amanda Bynes?,Michael
She's from 'What a Girl Wants.',Kelly
"Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope. So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.",Michael
"Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.",Jim
You are being too modest.,Michael
"Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.",Jim
"Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.",Michael
"The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, 'Describe your act.' And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, 'What do you call yourselves?' And the man says, 'The Aristocrats!'",Dwight
"[breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...",Pam
[finishes story] I mean truly repulsive acts.,Dwight
"That is a very, very funny story.",Michael
"[runs over after walking over fire coals] Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that. Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist. [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends. And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.",Pam
"Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.",Michael
"Flintstones, meet the Flintstones. They're a modern stone-age family. Ba-ba-da-da-da. From the town of Bedrock, they're a page right out of history. Ba-da-da-da-da. [overlapping singing of the wrong verses] When you're with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time, a dabba-doo time, we'll have a gay old time!",Group
WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!,Michael
Nice!,Andy
So we have about an hour and a half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus. Fun on wheels. Only way to travel. Besides a monorail.,Michael
"Well, Bob was going to just drive me.",Phyllis
"No. No, no, no. No guests today. Classic gang only. Just us good friends, and Karen and Andy.",Michael
"Sometimes Michael gets nostalgic and he talks about the classic gang. That's Michael, me, Jim, Dwight, Angela, Kevin, Oscar, Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, Meredith, Kelly and Ryan. We're a regular Ocean's Eleven.",Pam
"Jim, David Wallace is calling for you.",Pam
"Oh, okay. Hello. Hey, David. Sure.",Jim
"Pam, you broke up with your boyfriend and then kept working together. How did that work out?",Michael
You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don't talk to him anymore really.,Pam
Acrimonious.,Michael
This way to the party bus. Good.,Michael
"[Sign says 'No Alcohol, No Loud Talking'] Um, What the hell?",Meredith
It's a bus that takes you to a party. Here we go.,Michael
"Um, I forgot my...",Meredith
"Here we go. Come on. Okay, everybody here?",Michael
Yeah!,All
"Then, Mr. Driver, we are off like a herd of turtles! Johnny Carson. [Meredith runs to catch up to bus with her large drink cup]",Michael
"Seat belts fastened, folks. Safety first. Hey what is all this?",Dwight
Nothing.,Michael
"If I guess, will you tell me?",Dwight
No.,Michael
Please?,Dwight
No!,Michael
Is that a sumo suit?,Dwight
No.,Michael
"I know, we're putting on a play for Japanese investors.",Dwight
"No, we are not.",Michael
Please tell me. I've been so good...,Dwight
You are really annoying me. If you don't knock it off...,Michael
Please.,Dwight
...I'm never gonna tell you anything ever again. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!,Michael
Please.,Dwight
Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?,Meredith
No. We're only 10 minutes from the lake.,Michael
"Pull over! Pull over! [Meredith uses a bush while all the other passengers look the other way, except Creed]",Meredith
"Yes, I am choosing my apprentice. Which is why I have modeled all my games after Survivor.",Michael
Any questions?,Michael
Just one.,Jim
Yup.,Michael
The torches are lit.,Jim
"Yes, for dramatic affect.",Michael
"No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.",Jim
"Very good, Jim. Pam, please note that Jim is very astute. All right, are we ready?",Michael
Are you not gonna put out the torches?,Jim
Set!,Michael
Okay.,Jim
Go!,Michael
"I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he's eye candy. It's OK, Bob... Vance knows he's on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute.",Phyllis
"It is an honor just to be considered for Michael's job. Honestly. And if I win it, then I will be ordering a pretty sizeable Most Improved Player plaque to put over the hole I punched in the wall.",Andy
"[sighs] Okay. Pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?",Michael
"Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim.",Pam
Because he wasn't following the rules.,Michael
I think they were just having fun.,Pam
"But they didn't complete their task, Pam! If people can't carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?",Michael
It tells me nothing.,Pam
Exactly. Are you sure you're doing that right? Taking an awfully long time.,Michael
There's 800 of them!,Pam
"Okay, all right.",Michael
It's very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can...,Michael
Hotdogs are really unhealthy.,Meredith
Son of a bitch. God! Okay. All right you know what? Here we go. On your mark! Get set!,Michael
Is there any mustard?,Phyllis
"No mustard! No mustard! Just... eat it. Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.",Michael
That's what she said!,Everyone
"No, no, no, no, not that--- just... come on, you guys, let's do it! I'm serious. Who's got the hungry?",Michael
I do!,Dwight
Who's got the hungry?,Michael
I do!,Dwight
"Come on, Ryan...",Michael
Let's go.,Dwight
"Ryan, I want to see you with a hot dog in your mouth. Right now.",Michael
Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.,Jim
"Keep eating tuna, Big Tuna. Loser!",Andy
He's gonna throw up.,Jim
[Dwight and Stanley are in sumo suits] Ready! Go!,Michael
The guy who sits behind me and the guy who sits across from me are fighting to see who becomes my boss. [laughs],Phyllis
"[Dwight knocks Stanley down] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Eat sand, you fat, old man!",Dwight
"Oh, I'm out of it. Let's face it, the hot dog-eating contest was my best shot.",Kevin
"Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.",Ryan
You? You haven't made a sale.,Michael
"I know, but I'd like to give this a try.",Ryan
Don't try to flirt your way into this. Sometimes you really creep me out.,Michael
"[in sumo suit, waves down a car, which swerves around him, runs after it, waving his arms] Wait! [throws sumo hair-hat at the retreating car]",Andy
"Andy Bernard is in first place with four hot dogs! Dwight Schrute is a close second with three and a half! Here comes Stanley! Here comes Stanley, with three hot dogs!",Michael
"This is an inflatable sumo suit. [blows] Now, in the olden days, when they wanted to find a guy who could be king, they would have him pull a sword out of a stone. Well, times have changed. [blows] And it's not even about who is the best sumo wrestler. It's about who is the best boss. And I don't even care who wins. [blows] It's how they wrestle in a blow-up suit... [breathes in] that will tell me all I need to know [blows] or how sumo... [collapses]",Michael
[at Dunder-Mifflin Corporate in NY] David!,Michael
"[confused] Oh, Michael?",David
Are we all set?,Michael
Isn't our interview tomorrow?,David
"Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello.",Michael
You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?,David
Thought I'd catch a show.,Michael
In the middle of a work day?,David
"Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.",Michael
Okay.,David
"Um, how many people are you interviewing?",Michael
We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.,David
"Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?",Michael
I don't think so.,David
Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?,Michael
I believe we put you in charge.,David
"Ah, great. No further questions.",Michael
"Okay, Michael.",David
Okay.,Michael
I'm really looking forward to our interview.,David
And I'm really looking forward to working with you.,Michael
"I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late.",Michael
[Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.,Kevin
"Hey, Kev.",Jim
What's different about you? You look worse.,Kevin
Thank you.,Jim
"You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot.",Meredith
Ohhh...,Jim
Turn around.,Meredith
No.,Jim
Yes.,Meredith
No way.,Jim
Do it!,Meredith
"Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.",Andy
[exhales loudly] Andy...,Jim
"What is it, Big Haircut?",Andy
Nothing.,Jim
"Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut.",Andy
Yup.,Jim
What?,Andy
"Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.",Jim
Hey. I think it looks great.,Pam
"Thanks, Pam.",Jim
"After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from. For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.",Pam
[knock on door] Yeah.,Michael
You wanted to see me?,Dwight
"Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.",Michael
"But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe. Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry] Thank you.",Dwight
Okay. Uh...,Michael
"[cries harder] Thank you, Michael.",Dwight
"Uh, okay.",Michael
"[sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much.",Dwight
Stop crying.,Michael
[sobbing] Thank you.,Dwight
Ohhhhh...,Michael
Hey.,Pam
Hey.,Karen
"Um, about the beach...",Pam
"It's okay, we all say things without thinking.",Karen
"Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird.",Pam
[confused] Oh. Okay.,Karen
Pam is... kind of a bitch.,Karen
"Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.",Karen
"Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.",Jim
So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.,Jim
Why so you can do it?,Michael
[looks annoyed],Karen
Whoops.,Jim
"No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...",Michael
Hmmm.,Jim
Heh.,Karen
Moon each other.,Michael
"Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?",Jim
All right.,Michael
All right.,Jim
Your loss.,Michael
"Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?",Karen
Cruise control.,Michael
Oh.,Karen
"So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?",Kevin
"Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.",Jim
Pam is taller.,Kevin
You sure?,Jim
"Yes. She has bigger breasts, too.",Kevin
Wow.,Jim
I think Karen has a prettier face.,Kevin
"Uh, hmm. [thinking] Uh, hmm. What else?",Jim
Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.,Kevin
Hm. Really tough call.,Jim
Yeah.,Kevin
"You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.",Jim
Will do.,Kevin
All right. [smiles],Jim
"Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you. I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]",Oscar
"Wow, very funny.",Pam
I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.,Stanley
"Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.",Kelly
[smiles],Pam
"You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.",Meredith
I remember. I blogged the whole thing.,Creed
www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out.,Creed
Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.,Ryan
"There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.",Michael
Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?,Kevin
"No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.",Michael
Maybe you should talk to her? Before...,Oscar
"No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.",Michael
Michael...,Oscar
What?,Kevin
Why?,Angela
"I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense.",Oscar
"Yes, I...",Michael
Wha? Who gave you that advice?,Angela
"Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...",Kevin
I have to buy another place.,Michael
But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk],Angela
You're not sure that you have the job.,Oscar
"I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid. Sold in record time.",Michael
"How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?",Dwight
"No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.",Angela
"No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I'm taking his job.",Dwight
"[smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.",Angela
"[squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.",Dwight
"Oh hey, Dwight.",Jim
I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check in time is now. Check out time is never.,Dwight
Does my room have cable?,Jim
No. And the sheets are made of fire.,Dwight
Can I change rooms?,Jim
"Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.",Dwight
Can I have a late checkout?,Jim
I'll have to talk to the manager.,Dwight
You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?,Jim
I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan!,Dwight
"Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?",Jim
"Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.",Dwight
Go.,Jim
Eighty thousand dollars a year.,Dwight
Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two. My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.,Dwight
[signing interview sheet] I will see you at the inter-view.,Andy
Yes you will.,Dwight
Who is D. Abramson?,Michael
He's from that company in Pitts...,Pam
[walks through front door] Michael.,Jan
Why... are you here?,Michael
"Uh, how are you?",Jan
"I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.",Michael
"I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?",Jan
Why privately?,Michael
"I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.",Jan
"Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.",Michael
Okay.,Jan
Okay.,Michael
"Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.",Michael
What do you want me to do?,Pam
"Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.",Michael
What about Meredith?,Pam
No. She's an alternate.,Michael
"So, how you been?",Michael
Been good.,Jan
Good.,Michael
Good.,Jan
Yeah.,Michael
"Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.",Jan
"Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages.",Michael
"So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.",Pam
Cause of Jan again?,Karen
"Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?",Karen
"Uh, sure.",Pam
Thanks.,Karen
I really hope you get the job.,Pam
Thanks. [looks suspicious],Karen
"After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.",Jan
Hmm.,Michael
To kinda clear my mind.,Jan
Sound good. Sounds fun.,Michael
"It was. Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know? Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.",Jan
Hmm..,Michael
I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.,Jan
Would you excuse me for a second?,Michael
Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room],Jan
Defcon twenty. She wants to get back together.,Michael
What are you gonna do?,Phyllis
"I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please...",Michael
Do you want to get back together with her?,Karen
"No, no. What do I do?",Michael
Just don't get back together with her.,Pam
What if she makes me?,Michael
How can she make you get back together with her?,Angela
She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do.,Michael
This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.,Pam
I wasn't.,Michael
You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.,Pam
You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.,Michael
Right.,Pam
Wow.,Michael
Do it.,Karen
I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.,Michael
"[walks back into office with Jan] Okay. [clears throat] Jan, we need to talk. [Jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged]",Michael
"Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.",Michael
Oh my God. [mouths to Jim],Pam
"Yeah, bigger actually.",Jim
[whispers] That's crazy!,Pam
Mm-hm.,Jim
[mouths] Wow!,Pam
[moves to block Jim from Pam's eyeline] Oh my God. Can you believe that?,Karen
Unbelievable.,Jim
Wow!,Karen
She could put the cup right there.,Jim
I know!,Karen
"No, it's fine. I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that",Pam
"I would never do that. Waste of money. In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.",Meredith
"I love fake boobs. Often times, you find them on strippers.",Kevin
"I find it offensive. Au natural, baby. That's how I like 'em. Swing low, sweet chariots.",Creed
So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.,Jan
Yeah.,Michael
"I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.",Jan
First got priorities.,Michael
And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...,Jan
Let's get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs],Michael
"No. No, no, no, no. I'll tell you this, it is",Michael
"Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps] Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy's name] Andrew Bernard.",Dwight
Saving the best for first!,Andy
"All right, you guys. See you later, wish us luck!",Karen
"No! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do not wish them luck. Do not wish them luck. All luck must be wished unto Michael.",Dwight
"Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]",Oscar
What did I say!?,Dwight
[to Jim] Good luck.,Pam
Thanks.,Jim
"I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche. And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche... Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care. Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye.",Pam
I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity. What is the best color?,Dwight
"White, because it contains all other colors.",Andy
Wrong. Black. It is the most dominant. How do you make a table?,Dwight
"You make a chair, but you don't sit on it.",Andy
What is the capital of Maine?,Dwight
"The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.",Andy
"Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk. Don't wanna hear about it. Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.",Dwight
Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.,Andy
"You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.",Dwight
"I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?",Andy
"I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.",Andy
"[Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed.",Dwight
Damn it!,Andy
This interview is over. I'll let you know.,Dwight
"[Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.",Karen
"Totally, no problem. What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...",Jim
"Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house.",Karen
"Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too? What did she accomplish?",Jim
"No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me.",Karen
Oh...,Jim
Cause I'm going to get the job.,Karen
[holding Jan's breasts] Remarkable.,Michael
Thanks.,Jan
"Wait, wait. Check one more time.",Michael
"Oh, okay.",Jan
Very good [Jan nods],Michael
"Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?",Jan
"Yes, indeed.",Michael
Good luck with your interview. [whispers] Bye.,Jan
"So, I guess we're getting back together.",Michael
What happened?,Pam
"Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.",Michael
"Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life. She treated me poorly. We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman. Love is a mystery.",Michael
So we have all night. Where do you want to go first?,Karen
"Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?",Jim
How often do you come here?,Karen
"Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.",Jim
"I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim.",Karen
"Hey, everybody. The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado, [clicks on small tape player] I would like to start saying my goodbyes [Song: Thank You, by Natalie Merchant plays in background] Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.",Michael
[Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work?,Dwight
"[Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.",Jim
"That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]",Karen
So what's going to happen to us when I get this job?,Karen
Oh do you mean when I get the job?,Jim
"Well,",Karen
You mean Kevin?,Jim
"Exactly. But you get it, right? Can't stay there.",Karen
"Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]",Jim
[exhales] How are you guys doing? Need anything?,Michael
"Uh, no, we're good. Thanks.",Karen
"I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me.",Michael
[points at bearded man] Who's that?,Jim
That,Michael
Beardy?,Jim
Mm-hmm.,Michael
I'm gonna introduce myself.,Jim
"No, no, no, just... that's not his real name. That's just what I call him, so...",Michael
"I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered. Except daddy... is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep.",Michael
Michael is gone.,Dwight
Hail to the chief!,Andy
My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.,Dwight
My first order of business: accept.,Andy
As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug],Dwight
"Three months ago, I was nowhere. I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management. Look where I am now. Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug]",Andy
"Hey! Hunter! Wha's up my brutha? This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.",Michael
"Uh, administrative assistant.",Hunter
Jan in yet?,Michael
I think she's comin' in... later.,Hunter
"Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?",Michael
Sure.,Hunter
"Just say, 'I want to squeeze them.' It's code. She'll know what it means.",Michael
Okay.,Hunter
"Oh, and Hunter? Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the 'motorboat' noise] 'Brbrbrbrbr!' also?",Michael
You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk. Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.,Dwight
Thank you.,Pam
"I had to make Andy my number two. It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand. I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.",Dwight
Really?,Pam
"Well, in a sense. Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.",Dwight
You will be your own assistant.,Pam
"Correct, I need someone I can trust. But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you. Just stripped of its pomp and frills.",Dwight
"Okay. So... you would be the Regional Manager,",Pam
"Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant",Dwight
Mm-hmm.,Pam
Do you accept?,Dwight
"Absolutely, I do.",Pam
"I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, 'Absolutely, I do.'",Pam
"[knocks on door] Hello, hello!",Michael
"Michael, good to see you!",David
Good to see you. Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.,Michael
"Oh, great. I've been meaning to thank you by the way. You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget? That is nice work. [Michael smiles] So, let me ask you a question right off the bat. What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?",David
Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard. I care too much. And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.,Michael
Okay. And your strengths?,David
"Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.",Michael
Oh. Yes. Very good.,David
Thank you.,Michael
Very good.,David
Dwight is our new boss.,Phyllis
"Oh, Michael's not going anywhere.",Oscar
Then who do you think will get the job?,Pam
Karen. She looks corporate. Those little pants suits.,Kevin
I think it's gonna be Michael.,Phyllis
Do you really think he's qualified for that job?,Oscar
"No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.",Phyllis
[laughs] Mm. Yeah.,Oscar
"Listen up! Come to the center of the room, please. This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck. When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck. One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.",Dwight
[raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?,Pam
"Excellent question, Pam. 1/100th of a cent.",Dwight
So ten,Oscar
Just... zip your lid! Another announcement. Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness. No longer. No more meetings!,Dwight
Amen.,Stanley
"Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.",Dwight
[raises hand] Do we have to?,Kevin
"Yes! Michael is gone. There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is 'me.' Conference room! Ten seconds! All of you!",Dwight
I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned. And I wish Jim were here.,Pam
What do you think we could be doing better?,David
"I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like, 'Paper Great. Where great paper is our passion. We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!' I don't know, could be good. Or, uh, 'Super Duper Paper. It's super duper.' I don't know, something like that.",Michael
Okay!,David
Okay.,Michael
"Thanks for comin' in, Michael.",David
Thank you.,Michael
It is always a treat when our paths cross.,David
It is always a treat when,Michael
You're back together.,David
"Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her. [laughs] Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.",Michael
"Okay, uh. Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job.",David
"I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?",Michael
"No, we're letting Jan go.",David
Listen up. Let's start... from the ground,Dwight
[at the same time as Dwight] Trees.,Kevin
Trees! And where do trees grow?,Dwight
[at the same time as Dwight] Forest.,Kevin
"Soil. Right. We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil. Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth? Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head 'no'] Wrong! It's nitrogen! Absorb this information. Good! Now, let us discuss precipitation. Stanley! When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?",Dwight
Liquid.,Stanley
Very good! You have earned one Schrute Buck.,Dwight
I don't want it.,Stanley
Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!,Dwight
Make it 100.,Stanley
We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?,Dwight
"No. In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.",Stanley
What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?,Dwight
The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.,Stanley
Okay---,Dwight
That's it!,Andy
What---,Dwight
"Class is canceled, everybody out!",Andy
"No wait, what are you doing?!",Dwight
I'm punishing them.,Andy
"No, no, no, wait! Class is not canceled.",Dwight
"[grumbling, getting loud]",Everyone
HEY! COME ON! Let's listen to Dwight's presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam],Pam
What--- What are you winking for?,Oscar
Zip your lid!,Dwight
"So, that's... my basic 5 year plan. And after that, who knows?",Karen
"Okay. Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but...",David
Yeah?,Karen
...what do you think about Michael Scott?,David
He's a very nice man. And he's very well suited for the job he has now.,Karen
This is off the record.,David
He would be disaster.,Karen
Hey you!,Jan
Hey.,Michael
How was your interview?,Jan
Pretty good.,Michael
Yeah?,Jan
Could have gone better I guess.,Michael
Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you.,Jan
Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.,Michael
What?,Jan
"Daaah, let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow. You have some savings right? You could pay off my debts. It would... be fine. We'd have fun.",Michael
What's... what's the matter? What... what happened in there?,Jan
I can't tell you.,Michael
Tell me what?,Jan
You son of a bitch!,Jan
"Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview---",David
You're,Jan
"Frankly, it's overdue. Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.",David
Erratic?,Jan
"Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work! You smoke constantly in your office. You spend most of the day online shopping. You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days. Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale. You go to Scranton far more often than you used to---",David
[opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?,Jan
"Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---",Michael
"No, I wanna know. I wanna know! Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!",Jan
It's not.,David
No?,Jan
It's not.,David
"Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.",Jan
The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company. You are clearly unstable.,David
Hey!,Michael
Yeah!,Jan
No--- We're all unstable.,Michael
"Okay, you know what? I'm just not leaving. I'm not leaving. Not leaving.",Jan
"David, I did not tell her.",Michael
"It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.",Andy
"It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. [laughs]",Dwight
This is gonna look so awesome!,Andy
"It's so intimidating! Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!",Dwight
[laughs] Totally!,Andy
[giving a hug] Bye Hunter.,Jan
Bye.,Hunter
Good luck with your band.,Jan
"Oh, thank---",Hunter
"Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].",Jan
"So, I am gonna... give her a ride home. Let me know about the job.",Michael
"Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction.",David
"Good, I'm glad we're on the same page. I have a lot of ideas for new directions.",Michael
"No, we're not giving you the job.",David
"You know what? That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal?",Michael
I do.,David
"Good. Very good. I'm glad we are finally on the same page. Still have my job in Scranton, though.",Michael
Yes.,David
Good. That's all I ever wanted. These two. [points at Jim and Karen] Either one of them... excellent candidates.,Michael
Wow. That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction.,Karen
Yeah. Kinda feel bad for her though.,Jim
Don't! She's nuts! [they laugh],Karen
"Oh, man. You know what? This might take a while. You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.",Jim
"Okay, good! Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch. And, I was gonna meet them, so...",Karen
Okay.,Jim
Just call me when you're done.,Karen
Sure.,Jim
"Good luck, Halpert.",Karen
Thank you.,Jim
"[phone rings, picks up] Dunder Mifflin, this is Grace. Sure.",Receptionist
"Oh, God! I mean, I just don't understand! It's just",Jan
"I know. I know, I'm sorry about that. That was terrible.",Michael
"Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know? It's fine, actually, I do. I really think it's great that it happened. Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]",Jan
"Well, it's... [Jan starts crying, high pitched whining] No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK.",Michael
"[sobbing] Oh, I know, I know. It's just... I'm sorry. It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery. Ohhh! They make my moods totally unpredictable! Wow! What am I gonna do?",Jan
[whispers] I don't know. [normal volume] Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo. I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.,Michael
"Live together. Actually, wait a minute! This could be great! This could be perfect! You know, my full-time job could be our relationship. I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work. This could work, really!",Jan
"[in the office, imitating the terminator] I'll be baaaaack! And I am baaaack!",Michael
How'd it go?,Pam
"No. No, Pam. I'm baaaaaack! For gooood! Kevin Nealon.",Michael
"Everybody, may I have your attention please? It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job. I know, I know, I know. 'Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoe in.' Well, got down there. I nailed the interview. And the strangest thing happened. Why is my office black?",Michael
To intimidate my subordinates.,Dwight
That's stupid.,Michael
It was Andy's idea.,Dwight
"You shouldn't have taken it. Bad management! Good thing I'm baaaaaack. [laughs] Ryan, coffee.",Michael
I don't do that stuff anymore.,Ryan
"No, it's for me, bimbo. Kids.",Michael
"So I'm back. And I am never, ever going to leave. I am going nowhere. This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.",Michael
Did... Karen get the job?,Pam
[to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin' on that coffee.,Michael
"Pam, hello.",Dwight
"Dwight, hello.",Pam
"I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager. You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]",Dwight
"No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic. And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today. Jim and I... are just... too similar. Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man. A man version. But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay.",Pam
I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.,David
I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh],Jim
"Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim. You're clearly a very bright guy.",David
Thanks.,Jim
"Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet---",David
"I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]",Jim
"Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?",David
"Yes, absolutely.",Jim
"And that, uh, questionnaire. Sorry to make you fill that thing out...",David
"Oh, no, absolutely.",Jim
"...that's a HR formality. We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like. [Jim notices a small note inside his papers, it reads 'Jim, Don't forget us when you're famous! Pam' It has a gold medal yogurt lid attached.] Kendall. Ugh. So, first up...",David
[hands David his papers] There you go.,Jim
How do you think you function here in New York?,David
"[not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great. You know? I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh... Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight. [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.",Jim
You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam's note] What have you liked most about that place?,David
[thinks] The friendships.,Jim
"Okay. Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul. So... long haul. Where do you see yourself in ten years?",David
[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?,Jim
Medium rare. Thanks. [they laugh],Pam
The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.,Jim
I know.,Pam
"And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.",Jim
"Well, I wish you would.",Pam
"[phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just one moment, I'll transfer you.",Pam
"I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job. I mean, why wouldn't he? He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK. We're friends. And I'm sure we'll stay friends. We just, we never got the timing right. You know? I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and... But you know what? It's OK. I'm totally fine. Everything is gonna be totally--- [Jim walks in]",Pam
"Pam. [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?",Jim
Yes.,Pam
All right. Then... it's a date.,Jim
"[to camera, tearing up, smiling] I'm sorry, what was the question?",Pam
"[on phone] So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty. But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job. [laughs] Great! I'm so glad. We're all very excited you're going to be joining us. It'll be nice to have another MBA around here.",David
"[on phone, smiling] I'm excited too. Okay. Bye.",Ryan
Who was that?,Kelly
[still smiling] Nobody. You and I are done.,Ryan
What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera],Kelly
Where do you see yourself in ten years?,David
"Well, [clears throat] I've actually done a lot of thinking about that. And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids. And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth. And, because it's the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.",Michael
A... multivitamin?,David
"Well, I don't know what it's gonna be called, but... my point is, the future of this company is now. And the future... is me.",Michael
"Michael, what happened?",Phyllis
"Jan got fired. And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend. But more than that, I realized that... I couldn't take a job that would take me away from this place. This is where I belong. This is... my home. And home is where the hardest.",Michael
Home is where the,Oscar
Heart is. That makes a lot more sense. You think they'd help each other out like that at corporate? [Oscar shrugs] I think not!,Michael
"Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he's boss, it'll be really awkward.",Kelly
Mmm-hmm. [nods],Pam
"But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn't feel the same way, and then he'll be gone.",Kelly
"Yeah, well, you know, whatever happens. [Kelly puts her hand on Pam's shoulder] Oh.",Pam
"Pam, he's just not that into you.",Kelly
"Oh, I know. We talked about it and he told me.",Pam
"No, seriously Pam, wake up.",Kelly
Okay.,Pam
Kelly made me realize something. She and I have... nothing in common. And I need more friends.,Pam

"New York real estate. I started by looking for a brownstone, like the Huxtables had, [shakes head] but instead I found this very, very, nice place in Jamaica, Queens, mon. It is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if I fall asleep, I still end up at home. It is a suh-weeeet one bedroom. I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he's a sophomore at Queens College. He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so... free food, and the place always smells like curry. So, win/win.",Michael
"Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk. It's soy. [walks into bedroom, Jan sleeping on bed] This is why I do it, that's what I have to come home to. [sighs] She probably won't be up for a few hours.",Michael

How much did you pay for it?,Jim
Not relevant.,Pam
You paid for it?,Jim
It all happened so fast.,Pam
"I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.",Jim
Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again.,Pam
"Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]",Kevin
"I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.",Oscar
Are you kidding me?,Kevin
And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.,Pam
Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.,Jim
Cool.,Pam
Yeah.,Jim
Well have fun with that.,Pam
Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.,Michael
What?,Jim
Where?,Dwight
"It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK.",Michael
What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?,Stanley
So she's really going to be fine?,Oscar
"Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.",Michael
Thank God you were there.,Pam
Yeah.,Michael
Did you see who did it?,Andy
No need we can just check the security tapes.,Dwight
Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.,Michael
Who was driving?,Jim
"Oh, Michael.",Pam
One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.,Jim
It's only Meredith.,Dwight
"Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.",Michael
Hey... Why did you do it?,Dwight
It was an accident.,Michael
Was she talkin' back?,Dwight
No.,Michael
Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?,Dwight
"Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers.",Pam
"Who's we, you and Jim?",Kevin
"No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.",Pam
"Oh, I bet Jim goes too.",Kevin
"Yeah, I haven't asked him yet.",Pam
"Oh, I bet you ask?",Kevin
I was planning on it.,Pam
I bet you were.,Kevin
Angela?,Pam
[whispers to Kevin] Subtle.,Oscar
What,Kevin
[to Angela] Are you coming?,Pam
"I can't, Sprinkles is sick.",Angela
"She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.",Angela
"I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?",Angela
Can't your other cats keep her company.,Pam
"There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques.",Angela
"Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job.",Pam
[sighs] All right!,Angela
My lord my liege.,Michael
Yes Michael?,Ryan
"So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?",Michael
So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.,Michael
Back? Why is that Michael?,Ryan
"Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.",Michael
Oh! Did you do this on purpose?,Ryan
"No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in...",Michael
Did this happen on company property?,Ryan
"Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine.",Michael
I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.,Ryan
"Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is: we are fine?",Michael
[sigh],Ryan
"People keep calling me a 'Wunderkind'; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word.",Ryan
Hey D.,Angela
"Hey monkey, what's up?",Dwight
Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.,Angela
Sure.,Dwight
I have to visit the alchy.,Angela
"Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.",Dwight
I wouldn't put it past her.,Angela
So what do you need me to do?,Dwight
I wrote it out.,Angela
Mm-hmm.,Dwight
"There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.",Angela
"Ok, I have an announcement.",Michael
You pushed Darryl out the window?,Oscar
No.,Michael
You shot Dwight?,Phyllis
"No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.",Michael
"Oh good, so we don't have to work.",Jim
"OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1.",Pam
"So, like a freedom tree.",Michael
I can take 3 people.,Pam
I can also take 3 people.,Jim
[to Kevin] Separate cars.,Oscar
Pam.,Michael
"Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room.",Pam
Pam.,Michael
Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.,Pam
"Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.",Michael
I...,Pam
Excellent!,Michael
I was thinking that we...,Pam
Good work Pam.,Michael
But...,Pam
"Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?",Michael
You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.,Stanley
"Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!",Michael
"Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make.",Michael
Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.,Michael
She looks awful.,Kelly
"No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault.",Michael
I think she's awake.,Jim
No... She's in a coma.,Michael
No.,Nurse
"OK... Meredith, [hauntingly] Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.",Michael
At the same time.,Meredith
Yeah.,Michael
Hello Meredith.,Stanley
This is weird.,Meredith
"Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go. [wraps them around her IV] Tie these up, cheer up your tubes... [IV pops out] Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake!",Michael
Whoa!,Kevin
Nurse.,Michael
"No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.",Meredith
[groaning] I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke.,Michael
I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.,Jim
"What, what are you doing? Just gimme that.",Nurse
Thanks.,Meredith
[applauds],Kevin
Does it hurt terribly?,Phyllis
"No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.",Meredith
"Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What...",Creed
I have no idea.,Meredith
Oh. [laughs],Creed
Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.,Meredith
"Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.",Michael
"Michael, I'm not gonna do that.",Meredith
Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.,Michael
"No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness.",Angela
"Well, just shhhh... just just...",Michael
You cracked my pelvis,Meredith
"Look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.",Michael
You're not forgiven.,Meredith
Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.,Michael
Michael! Michael!,Pam
[screams],Meredith
Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.,Michael
Hey.,Angela
Hey monkey.,Dwight
Any problems?,Angela
"Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.",Dwight
What!?,Angela
"Sparkles, the white one, is dead.",Dwight
Sprinkles.,Angela
"That was the sick one, right?",Dwight
Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.,Angela
No.,Dwight
Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?,Angela
Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.,Dwight
[sobbing],Angela
"So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.",Dwight
Alright.,Angela
"Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.",Dwight
[still sobbing],Angela
[to Angela] It's gonna be OK.,Pam
"OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just...",Michael
"Michael, Angela's cat died.",Pam
Sprinkles?,Michael
[nods],Angela
"[sighs] Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.",Michael
"Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious.",Michael
Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?,Michael
Like what?,Oscar
Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?,Michael
"No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies.",Toby
That's cool.,Pam
Yeah.,Toby
Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.,Michael
Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.,Angela
She's only a cat.,Dwight
You never... you don't like them.,Angela
Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.,Dwight
Dwight please!,Oscar
"Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?",Michael
"No, I have not.",Dwight
"Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.",Michael
"I do not respect her, but I will go.",Dwight
"Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.",Michael
"Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs...",Toby
Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.,Michael
"Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.",Toby
"Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.",Michael
"I'm... um, Catholic.",Stanley
OK.,Michael
Presbyterian.,Darryl
Alright.,Michael
Oh me too.,Pam
Oh?,Darryl
[puts hand up for high five] Same religion.,Pam
Alright! [high fives Pam],Darryl
I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.,Phyllis
That's why we're cursed.,Angela
"I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower, but you make more money as a leader.",Creed
"Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.",Michael
That's Buddhist.,Kelly
Are you sure?,Michael
No.,Kelly
What are you?,Michael
"Well if you're going to reduce my identity to my religion then I'm Sikh, but I also like Hip-hop and NPR, and I'm restoring a 1967 Corvette in my spare time.",IT Tech Guy
"OK, 1 Sikh, and...",Michael
"As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.",Dwight
Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.,Dwight
Don't pull any plugs.,Meredith
How are you doing Ms. Palmer?,Intern
Better.,Meredith
Excellent.,Intern
"Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?",Dwight
"Um... I'm an intern, which makes me a doctor, but...",Intern
"Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.",Dwight
"Ah, so uh... so that is where her uterus went... Um, Ms. Palmer, your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago?",Intern
"Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.",Meredith
Just doing my job.,Dwight
It also says you were recently bitten by a raccoon?,Intern
And a rat. Separate occasions.,Meredith
"You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. [sighs] And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense... God is dead.",Michael
If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.,Kelly
"Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.",Michael
I will do some research.,Jim
I can help you with that.,Pam
"So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.",Dwight
"Oh God, Rabies?",Michael
Mm-hmm.,Dwight
"I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?",Michael
"No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.",Dwight
This place is so cursed.,Michael
"Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.",Dwight
"[walks out into the office] I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.",Michael
"Six of one, really.",Jim
"Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people! [Kevin claps] Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.",Michael
"Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?",Michael
"[Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!",Kevin
"[Pam's car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. [Jim gets into the passenger side] Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. [Jim leans over and kisses Pam] Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know.",Pam
"Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.",Pam
Pro-Am.,Michael
Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.,Pam
"A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.",Michael
"[on the phone] No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?",Stanley
"Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?",Michael
Zero.,Stanley
"Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.",Michael
Isn't that your money?,Andy
"That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?",Michael
"Oh, it's coming.",Phyllis
"Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.",Michael
Michael?,Kevin
Yes.,Michael
You cannot make me run.,Kevin
OK. [walks away],Michael
"It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.",Kevin
"Alright, alright.",Michael
You didn't run for me...,Kevin
Shhh...,Michael
...when I thought I had skin cancer.,Kevin
I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.,Michael
No.,Kevin
"OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.",Michael
I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.,Kevin
"Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.",Michael
"[in bathroom] I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions. [tapes a cotton ball to each nipple]",Andy
"Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat. [Angela starts to cry]",Andy
"This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town.",Angela
"Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.",Angela
What's wrong?,Pam
"I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.",Angela
Hmm...,Pam
"When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.",Angela
Ah.,Pam
Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.,Angela
"Angela, I'm sorry.",Pam
Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?,Angela
I'm more of a dog person.,Pam
[sighs],Angela
So what's your strategy for this race?,Jim
Well I'm gonna start fast.,Pam
Mm-hmm.,Jim
Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.,Pam
What?,Jim
Then I'm gonna end fast.,Pam
Why won't more people do that? [laughs],Jim
Cause they're just stupid.,Pam
[looks at camera] What?,Jim
"[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...",Jim
Yeah... That was um...,Pam
"I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.",Jim
"Yeah, I gave him a ride home because...",Pam
Right!,Jim
... We're dating.,Pam
Wow! There it is.,Jim
"Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. [looks at Jim] Right?",Pam
It is going really great.,Jim
[Angela runs into Dwight] Oww!,Dwight
Shut up.,Angela
"You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.",Dwight
"Oh, really?",Angela
[sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.,Dwight
[pushes her chair into Dwight's legs] I'm not depressed I'm in grief.,Angela
"We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?",Michael
"Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?",Pam
Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...,Michael
"Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.",Jim
Giant check it is.,Pam
Yeah.,Jim
Yep.,Michael
"Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.",Dwight
Bat birth control,Jim
"Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.",Dwight
You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?,Michael
"Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.",Pam
Which we are.,Jim
And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.,Pam
What about a rabies nurse?,Michael
I don't think so.,Pam
"You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.",Jim
That's possible. Look into that.,Michael
"Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.",Jim
Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.,Dwight
Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.,Michael
"Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]",Pam
Come in.,Michael
Hey.,Pam
"Hey, hey, hey",Michael
Oh my God.,Pam
What are you doing?,Michael
You said come in!,Pam
"No I didn't, just please don't...",Michael
Oh my God.,Pam
So I closed the door but the image of his...,Pam
Baquette.,Jim
... dangling participle...,Pam
Eww.,Jim
... still burned in my eyes.,Pam
I can imagine.,Jim
[Michael knocks slowly on door] Come in.,Pam
May I enter the room?,Michael
Yes. Or come in.,Pam
See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.,Michael
You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?,Jim
"Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.",Michael
"On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.",Pam
European offices are naked all the time.,Michael
They're so not.,Pam
Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...,Michael
I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.,Pam
[sighs] Gross.,Jim
"That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun.",Michael
Alright.,Jim
They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.,Pam
"[naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?",Jim
"OK, name please.",Jan
"Creed Bratton, 75 plus division.",Creed
You're over 75 years old?,Jan
82 November first. How much is the prize money?,Creed
There's no prize money.,Jan
"What, is any of this real?",Creed
"Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?",Michael
So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.,Jan
"What? Look, no it was not...",Pam
"I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.",Jan
"OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.",Michael
[feeding a squirrel] I'm giving him a peanut.,Darryl
"No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?",Michael
Look how happy he is.,Darryl
"He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse's outfit] This is the reason we're here.",Michael
Hello Michael.,Elizabeth
"Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?",Michael
Yeah.,Elizabeth
"Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.",Michael
Great. [everyone claps],Elizabeth
You got it?,Michael
Mm-hmm.,Dwight
"OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.",Michael
"Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing.",Michael
"On your marks, get set...",Dwight
[pulls Toby's pants down] Beow!,Michael
Hey! [extremely loud gunshot],Toby
On your left!,Michael
"You're doing great Michael, look at you go!",Oscar
That's my boss! Yeah-ha baby!,Creed
"I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. [Creed, Stanley, and Oscar get into a cab]",Michael
Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.,Stanley
"I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance. [running right behind Kevin]",Andy
Yeah. [laughs] Oh we're in last place.,Pam
"Oh, would you look at that.",Jim
Darn it.,Pam
"Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?",Jan
"No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!",Michael
Michael that's irrational.,Jan
Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.,Michael
"Oh God! My nipples, it's starting.",Andy
"[Creed, Stanley, and Oscar sitting at a table] Can we get another round?",Creed
OK.,Waitress
Thanks.,Creed
"So we've got what, another 20 minutes?",Stanley
More or less.,Oscar
Hmmm...,Stanley
That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.,Michael
"You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.",Dwight
"[laughs] Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?",Michael
"I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today.",Toby
Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?,Jim
I don't know I'm really committed to winning.,Pam
"OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.",Jim
Mmm... Yes.,Pam
That's what I thought.,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
Right. Let's do some good.,Jim
"[Ryan looks at the phone as it rings... [Pam's voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race... [Michael's voice] for the cure... [Pam's voice] leave a message' Ryan hangs up]",Ryan
"[Burp] Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. [groans]",Michael
"[runs into the back of Kevin] Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin.",Andy
Back off me.,Kevin
"How ya feeling, better?",Dwight
No.,Angela
Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.,Dwight
The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.,Angela
I am a farmer Angela.,Dwight
What does that mean?,Angela
"OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.",Dwight
You did kill her!?,Angela
"I... I sang her, her favorite songs.",Dwight
You put her in my freezer.,Angela
It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.,Dwight
Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.,Angela
Well I'm not responsible for that!,Dwight
You! [hits Dwight],Angela
"Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK.",Dwight
It's OK.,Angela
"It's nothing, I'm robbing her.",Dwight
It's nothing.,Angela
It's fine. What?,Dwight
How could you do that without telling me?,Angela
"I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.",Dwight
"Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.",Angela
"I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.",Dwight
You don't understand.,Angela
[runs by] Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.,Michael
"Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?",Dwight
Don't touch me Dwight! [runs off crying],Angela
"[holding lamp] You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.",Pam
"Oh, and I get to carry it.",Jim
[crosses finish line] And the winner is Toby Flenderson.,Toby
"Have a seat, I'll write it down.",Kelly
Where are we?,Toby
"I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.",Kelly
He couldn't have made it a circle?,Toby
"[bent over] I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line]",Michael
...talk about it.,Jim
"Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?",Pam
"What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...",Jim
"I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just...",Michael
"Well, you're probably dehydrated.",Jim
What do you want me to do Jim?,Michael
Glass of water would be a start.,Jim
"No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins.",Michael
Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.,Jim
I'm still having a nice day.,Pam
You are?,Jim
"Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.",Pam
That's a good deal.,Michael
"And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much.",Pam
"Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.",Michael
"Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.",Pam
"You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.",Michael
"I know you Michael, I saw you naked.",Pam
"You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k [gets up groaning, Jim tries to help] No, no!",Michael
"Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that.",Michael
Hey Michael.,Meredith
Hey Mer. How ya doing?,Michael
Better.,Meredith
"It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.",Michael
"I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.",Meredith
"Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. [sighs, takes sucker out of his mouth] Wanna share?",Michael
Sure.,Meredith
"I'm not really sick. [Meredith takes a lick and hands back to Michael] Nah, I'm good.",Michael
Did you ever think of this? Would a sober person walk in front of a car?,Michael
Ay-o!,Andy
"I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?",Jim
Well...,Michael
That's despicable.,Phyllis
Michael.,Pam
That's not cool.,Someone
There's no proof of that.,Oscar
That's not...,Michael
"That seems early, even for her.",Kevin
"That's not what...no, no, I'm not saying that, that's disgusting.",Michael
Drunk? No! You can't get drunk off Kahlua. It's just a kind of coffee.,Meredith
Then... what are you saying?,Andy
I am saying... that... maybe I was drunk. Did you ever think of that?,Michael
Definitely not.,Jim
That'd be DUI.,Kevin
That's...,Phyllis
Okay.,Michael
Maybe she hit me. You ever think of that? She hit me? I don't know whose fault it was. I wasn't exactly looking at the road.,Michael
"Hey, Toby. [walks past him to Kelly's cubicle]",Pam
Hey.,Toby
"Kelly, we're going to visit Meredith at lunch. [Kelly's lying down on floor, head unseen under desk. She rolls to her side, away from Pam] Kelly?",Pam
"Well, Kelly's been so upset about Ryan dumping her, that she can't even talk. [grins]",Toby
"[from under desk] I don't want to talk to anybody about Ryan! Please, go away!",Kelly
They don't have this kind of technology at the vet's. It's not far.,Angela
It's fair.,Oscar
"You know what, why don't go around the room and say one memory of Meredith. I'll start. I liked her jumpers. They reminded me of Kindergarten. Jim?",Michael
"I'll always remember Meredith's back. That's all I can see from my desk. All that red hair, over a nice strong back. Sometimes I pretend it's Carrot Top, and he's going to turn around and tell a joke.",Kevin
"So, how's the view old girl? [looking out windows] Oh! There's a cemetery. You think that's affiliated with the hospital, or is it a like a separate feature...",Andy
"Hey! Okay, okay, okay, You can just close that.",Michael
"Bye, Meredith. Here you go. We got you some balloons.",Angela
"See you guys. [chorus of goodbyes, all but Michael file out as he's talking, Creed takes Meredith's pills]",Meredith
"Let's just... Why can't you just forgive... Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off? How do you know that you weren't born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?",Michael
"Oh please, Michael.",Meredith
I'm not going to leave until you forgive me.,Michael
You're gonna be here a,Meredith
"[standing for a while, sighs, turns to walk out] Oh, okay.",Michael
Nurse! I just need some water. And my pills. Thank you.,Meredith
There you go.,Nurse
There's nothing in here.,Meredith
This office is cursed. [sighs] And we need to do something about it.,Michael
Conference room?,Jim
"Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex. I'm just saying, at least right here [indicates floor in front of his office] is cursed. Conference room, 10 minutes.",Michael
"On the one hand, it's a relief to know that it's not just me, the whole office is cursed. On the other hand, I may have to deal with the dark unknown.",Michael
Question: Has anyone recently offended a Gypsy?,Dwight
We have to have done something wrong.,Michael
You ran over an employee.,Stanley
"That was the curse, Stanley, and we are trying to find the cause of the curse.",Michael
Mmm. [nods],Dwight
"Oscar, are you Santaria?",Michael
"I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist.",Oscar
"Oh. Great. We have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.",Michael
"Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?",Oscar
Yes. It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.,Michael
Oh.,Oscar
Stupid.,Michael
"My cousin Mose's best friend was a dog. One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead. Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose's cream pies. Did I feel bad for killing him? No. That's how you deal with a thief.",Dwight
"Yeah, the, uh, the charity's having some financial problems. What do I look like to you, Paul Newman? That's actually not a good example, because I have been compared to a young Paul Newman, my eyes and my face. And I make my own salad dressing. I mix Newman's Ranch with Newman's Italian. Sell it at flea markets for a slight loss. I could make... I could make a profit if I changed one of the ingredients to Wishbone [shakes head] but I won't do it.",Michael
"Whoa, 'scuse me! Oh!",Michael
"Let... let's pick it up, Phyllis!",Bob Vance
"Oh, slow! Oh, ho, ho, ho. [laughing as he passes Phyllis and Bob] You guys are going so slow...",Michael
Go get him Bobby!,Phyllis
"Come on, I'm going backwards.",Michael
Sic him!,Phyllis
"Oh, all right! All right! All right! All right!",Michael
Sic him!,Phyllis
"Okay! [Bob Vance and Michael in an all-out sprint, Michael grunting]",Michael
"You're gonna be just fine, Michael! You're gonna have a good life.",Pediatrician
Thanks.,Michael
Lots of people suffer dehydration; they all recover just fine.,Pediatrician
"I'm Michael's pediatrician. Dehydration's pretty simple. He could also have been treated by a Boy Scout leader, a coach, or a, a... a water bottle.",Pediatrician
"Well, apparently, my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay. I will be paying out-of-pocket. Um... I kinda wish I'd been hit by a car.",Michael
"Hey, doc? You forgetting something? [pediatrician takes a lollypop from his pocket and gives it to Michael] Thank you.",Michael
Hey.,Pam
Hey.,Jim
I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim],Pam
"Oh wow, thank you.",Jim
Yeah.,Pam
"I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?",Jim
"No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right?",Pam
"I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.",Jim
Hey Toby. What's this? [holds up memo Toby has passed out to the staff],Michael
Ohh.,Toby
[reads memo] I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.,Michael
"Yes, uh some people in the office have complained...",Toby
Oh really.,Michael
"...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know [Michael leans in closer to Toby] I just wanted to remind it's not appropriate to, to do that.",Toby
"Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...",Michael
"Ok, look the memo is not about you...",Toby
"[to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.",Angela
"Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So...",Toby
[turns to address Jim and Pam] No way.,Michael
What?,Dwight
You guys are together?,Phyllis
"Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.",Jim
Woooah! Wow!,Michael
Tuna!,Andy
Awesome!,Michael
I knew it!,Kevin
You guys! Yes! Yes!,Michael
"Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?",Pam
Yes.,Toby
"Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. [gestures to Pam to get up] Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, [to Jim] stand up. [Jim moves over in chair] OK, here we go. [holding both Pam and Jim's hand] Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.",Michael
"Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.",Jim
"I love you guys, so much. [hugs Jim]",Michael
"Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]",Jim
Phone's ringing. [goes back toward desk],Pam
"No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is [starts to well up] really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.",Michael
I don't see it. I think they both could do better.,Dwight
It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.,Angela
Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?,Andy
Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.,Michael
Did you plan it?,Phyllis
"No. [tries to hide piece of paper, but Pam grabs it]",Michael
[reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?,Pam
Blowing up balloons I thought.,Michael
You might want to trim it a little.,Pam
Michael... [Kelly enters conference room in a flirty red dress],Phyllis
"[reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?",Kelly
"Yeah, he is.",Pam
Oh.,Kelly
Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.,Michael
What do you want?,Angela
To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].,Dwight
"Oh, what is that?",Angela
It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.,Dwight
Her name was Sprinkles.,Angela
And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises],Dwight
I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.,Angela
You haven't buried her yet?,Dwight
Don't rush me. I'm grieving.,Angela
"Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him.",Dwight
I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away],Angela
Hey Toby.,Pam
Hey... [sees both Jim and Pam] you two.,Toby
"Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.",Jim
"Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know [makes quotes with fingers] relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really.",Toby
Oh.,Jim
"Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official. [Jim smiles]",Pam
Uh huh.,Toby
"Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?",Jim
Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know?,Toby
What?,Jim
Let's just wait.,Toby
"Oh, OK.",Jim
OK.,Pam
Great. [Jim and Pam walk away],Jim
[sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back --,Pam
Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?,Ryan
Hey!,Michael
Yeah.,Pam
"There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. [laughing] He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs.",Michael
OK. Should we get started?,Ryan
"Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..",Michael
"Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.",Ryan
...business meeting --,Michael
[rubbing hands in Ryan's hair] Fire!,Kevin
Stop that! Stop that!,Ryan
That's right! That's right!,Michael
[to Kevin] You scared me.,Ryan
"Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan.",Michael
Fire guy [makes flames with his hands],Andy
You weren't here for that.,Kevin
Here for what?,Andy
When he started the fire.,Kevin
"Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man...",Michael
Little old man boy.,Kevin
"Michael and everybody, umm...",Ryan
Beard.,Michael
Bearded man boy.,Kevin
"...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.",Ryan
"Oh, wow!",Michael
So...,Ryan
That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.,Michael
OK...,Ryan
Woooo![laughs] I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.,Michael
Enough! OK? This is inappropriate and it stops right now. Do you understand?,Ryan
"Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in [looks at Ryan] 10 minutes?",Michael
Perfect.,Ryan
"Sounds good. OK, alright.",Michael
"Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, 'Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you.' His words.",Michael
Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.,Ryan
"Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading 'Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!']",Jim
This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.,Ryan
"OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.",Michael
I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?,Ryan
What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?,Dwight
"This is company-wide, Dwight.",Ryan
Got it. [Andy's hand goes up],Dwight
Andy.,Ryan
"We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?",Andy
Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.,Ryan
Can we speak privately about our relationship?,Kelly
Thank you everybody.,Ryan
Ryan Howard everybody. [starts clapping] Good job. [everyone gets up to leave],Michael
That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?,Creed
"As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.",Ryan
Cool beans.,Creed
We're screwed.,Creed
Who is?,Michael
Us? You and me. The old timers.,Creed
I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.,Michael
"You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners.",Creed
"Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.",Jim
No.. [in awe],Pam
"Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.",Jim
"No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque.",Pam
Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?,Jim
You didn't say anything to me?,Pam
Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.,Jim
Can you believe that...,Pam
"Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here.",Phyllis
"Oh no, we're just sitting here.",Jim
"I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?",Phyllis
OK.,Pam
OK.,Phyllis
OK.,Jim
And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.,Jim
"OK, what's up?",Ryan
"Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?",Michael
"Well it is business, but not as usual.",Ryan
"Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?",Michael
"No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.",Ryan
"Good, so, we're on the same page?",Michael
"No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.",Ryan
"We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.",Michael
"So, how are you?",Ryan
Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.,Kelly
Good.,Ryan
A lot. Black guys mostly.,Kelly
Kelly...,Ryan
What?!,Kelly
"Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?",Phyllis
I don't know.,Stanley
Did you even try?,Phyllis
"If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him.",Stanley
I can't see half of the things. [adjusts glasses],Phyllis
It's too little. Use the phone.,Stanley
I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.,Kelly
"Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.",Ryan
"Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me.",Kelly
"I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.",Ryan
"Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant.",Kelly
[shaking head],Kelly
"And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.",Kelly
OK. OK.,Ryan
Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?,Kelly
"I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?",Ryan
We have a date!,Kelly
Hello.,Dwight
"Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?",Angela
Really?,Dwight
Yes.,Angela
"I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.",Dwight
I would prefer a public place. See you after work.,Angela
"Hi, Pam.",Jan
Hi.,Pam
Is Michael in?,Jan
In his office. You can go right in.,Pam
[to Ryan] Hey.,Jan
Jan.,Ryan
"Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.",Jan
"So elephant in the room, I have your old job.",Ryan
"Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.",Jan
"Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.",Ryan
"Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry.",Jan
Well... you look great.,Ryan
"Thank you, thank you.",Jan
Scranton suits you.,Ryan
Best decision I ever made.,Jan
You were let go.,Ryan
You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office],Jan
Hey.,Michael
Hey.,Jan
"[holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?",Michael
What?,Jan
I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.,Michael
"So, what's Ryan doing here?",Jan
"Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.",Michael
He's such a snake.,Jan
Well...,Michael
I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.,Jan
What is that... word?,Michael
"Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.",Jan
So older people have just as many rights as younger people?,Michael
"Yes, Michael, they do.",Jan
Creed?,Oscar
"Yes, sir.",Creed
Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black],Oscar
"Everything's cool, dude.",Creed
"I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty.",Creed
"Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.",Ryan
Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.,Pam
[notices pictures on the wall] Ohh... man.,Ryan
"Good, we're all here, we can get started.",Michael
Michael.,Ryan
Have a seat.,Michael
We're not doing this today.,Ryan
Have a seat. Like everybody else.,Michael
OK. This is...,Ryan
"Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.",Michael
"Technically, he's right.",Toby
"Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?",Michael
Because they're lame.,Creed
"No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like 'where's the Beef?' [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.",Michael
"Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.",Jim
"Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.",Pam
"I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.",Michael
Oh. [man enters conference room],Pam
Michael Scott?,Robert Dunder
"[puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in]",Michael
"Oh, yeah. Yes!",Dwight
Thank you everyone.,Robert Dunder
"Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?",Ryan
Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] 'Scuse me. [closes door],Michael
We have actual work to do.,Ryan
Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. [they glare at each other],Michael
"Bob, how old are you?",Michael
I'm 87.,Robert Dunder
"Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?",Michael
"Well, I, I, I haven't been to a board meeting in years. I, I send a proxy.",Robert Dunder
"Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.",Michael
"I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.",Dwight
I started this company in 1949.,Robert Dunder
Wow.,Michael
"Back then, it was an uh, an industrial supplier of metal brackets mostly for, for construction.",Robert Dunder
"Oh, boy.",Michael
"And then Mifflin, of course he killed himself later... Uh, but I knew Mifflin through the Rotary Club.",Robert Dunder
Great.,Michael
"And he was, he was [starts laughing] at dinner with Beverly and her husband, wha-what was his name, umm... uhh... Jerry.. Jerry Trupiano from, from South Jersey and he was tall. Both he and Mifflin were tall guys.",Robert Dunder
Great.,Michael
And...,Robert Dunder
That's great. Thank you for coming in. [starts ushering him out] Robert Dunder everybody. [clapping] Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?,Michael
"Well I, I, I came here in a cab.",Robert Dunder
Perfect. [starts closing the door],Michael
"Well, cou, could you get me another... [Michael closes door]",Robert Dunder
"Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail. [Pam raises hand]",Michael
I think that I should help him get home.,Pam
"No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam. [Jim nods head and Pam gets up and leaves to help Robert Dunder, Michael shows Robert thumbs up] What a nice guy.",Michael
Good night guys. [staff leaves the office],Michael
"Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.",Ryan
"I disagree, I think it was very valuable.",Michael
"Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.",Ryan
I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.,Michael
Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?,Ryan
"You know, some place romantic and expensive.",Kelly
"Kelly, come on.",Ryan
"You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]",Kelly
Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?,Dwight
Very much. How's your meat?,Angela
Dry. Delicious.,Dwight
I heard a joke today.,Angela
"Oh, that's funny.",Dwight
"Yes, it was.",Angela
Are you enjoying your mineral water?,Dwight
I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.,Angela
"Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick.",Dwight
I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.,Angela
"No, please don't do this, monkey.",Dwight
I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant],Angela
"Hey guys. This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.",Toby
Hi.,Pam
"Hey, Amy. How ya doing?",Jim
Nice to meet you.,Pam
[under his breath] Nice to meet you.,Jim
[gesturing to the rest of the office] This is everybody else... okay... This is the place... so thanks for the lift.,Toby
"Yeah, sure. I'll, uh, I'll see you tonight, right?",Amy
"Absolutely. [Toby kisses Amy for an extended period of time, Pam and Jim are shocked]",Toby
Whoa. Easy tiger.,Amy
I just really like you.,Toby
Okay. Bye guys. Nice to meet you.,Amy
Have a great day!,Toby
"Whoa, Toby. Watch out. You're going to violate your own PDA memo.",Pam
I wouldn't want to do that now would I?,Toby
Smell that. Do you smell that?,Michael
Dry rot?,Dwight
"No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.",Michael
"Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles.",Andy
"Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.",Michael
"Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.",Michael
"Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.",Dwight
Thank you.,Angela
You're welcome.,Dwight
Is that all?,Angela
Yes... [whispers] I miss you.,Dwight
Elevators.,Angela
"Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?",Angela
Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends.,Dwight
Good.,Angela
"Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.",Dwight
[walks away],Angela
I don't understand what the big deal is.,Kelly
You don't?,Ryan
No!,Kelly
You lied about being pregnant.,Ryan
"Right, so?",Kelly
You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?,Ryan
No!,Kelly
We're never getting back together.,Ryan
Why not?,Kelly
Hey.,Jim
Hey.,Pam
"Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?",Jim
It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.,Pam
"I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?",Jim
"I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but...",Pam
Be honest.,Jim
I now find you repulsive.,Pam
"That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?",Jim
Eh...,Pam
"For me, it was.",Jim
OK.,Pam
Alright.,Jim
"Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.",Michael
"What's, uh, going on here?",Ryan
"I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.",Michael
With gift baskets.,Ryan
"With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.",Michael
"Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. 'You can't be on the team', 'You can't move on to second grade'. Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. [shakes head] We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.",Michael
"OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.",Michael
I'm not driving with him. [points at Dwight],Stanley
I'll go with you Stanley.,Andy
Or him.,Stanley
Why don't we just go by ourselves?,Jim
Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?,Michael
Michael.,Phyllis
Yes?,Michael
This is stupid.,Phyllis
"OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.",Michael
How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?,Phyllis
"Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.",Michael
"What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever.",Andy
What about a gift basket full of cash?,Jim
Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.,Andy
"Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. [walks toward the door]",Michael
"Michael, wait. Let me go.",Dwight
"No, this is my quest.",Michael
"Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. [camera moves around and zooms in at Angela's face] Please.",Dwight
Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.,Michael
Good luck Michael.,Ryan
We don't need luck.,Michael
Yeah.,Dwight
"But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.",Michael
Thank you.,Dwight
"Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.",Michael
"[speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.",Ryan
"[looks at vending machine] Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.",Creed
"[in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?",Dwight
It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.,Michael
"Ah, that's a pain in the ass.",Dwight
I know. So who's next?,Michael
Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.,Dwight
"Proceed to the highlighted route, then route guidence will begin.",GPS
Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.,Dwight
Who?,Michael
"The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry]",Dwight
"Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn.",Ryan
No way!,Kevin
Literally.,Ryan
"Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do.",Andy
... Later guys.,Ryan
"Yeah, later dude.",Kevin
Later man.,Andy
"Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?",Kevin
"Yeah, he's definitely something.",Jim
What does that mean?,Kevin
"That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?",Jim
Ha! Tuna... [inhales deeply] Tuna Tuna Tuna.,Andy
Tuna Tuna Tuna.,Kevin
"He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.",Andy
And he can get any girl that he wants.,Kevin
"So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons.",Andy
Tuna. Check you later.,Kevin
"[places the gift basket on top of the table] Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?",Michael
You know we closed our account with you right?,Larry Myers
Yes we do.,Michael
We're with Office Depot now.,Larry Myers
"Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.",Dwight
Well...,Michael
"And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.",Dwight
Mmhmm.,Michael
OK. I don't think we're coming back.,Larry Myers
"Please, come back.",Dwight
"OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.",Michael
Remember what we had Larry?,Dwight
"I mean, really it's about money.",Larry Myers
"Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.",Michael
OK thanks.,Larry Myers
Alright.,Michael
I mean their website is really easy to use too. That's a big deal for us.,Larry Myers
[driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?,Michael
I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.,Dwight
That is true.,Michael
Like Angela in accounting.,Dwight
"Yes, she is nuts.",Michael
"Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.",Dwight
Make the next right turn.,GPS
How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.,Michael
Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?,Ryan
Uh totally.,Pam
"Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?",Ryan
Yeah.,Pam
Thank you very much.,Ryan
Thank you.,Pam
Cool.,Ryan
OK.,Pam
"Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames. [laughs] I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited.",Pam
"And the last guy says 'No, hairy body'.",Michael
You know I have heard it before.,Ex-client
"Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?",Michael
"She's great, thanks for asking. Great memory.",Ex-client
"She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.",Michael
"Oh, OK.",Ex-client
"OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?",Michael
OK thanks for the goodies.,Ex-client
Ah... .is that all you have to say?,Michael
It looks delicious? I don't know.,Ex-client
You don't know?,Dwight
"Look, we want you back.",Michael
Can you offer lower prices?,Ex-client
"Well, no.",Michael
Then we're not coming back.,Ex-client
"He's not coming back, it's over Michael.",Dwight
No it's not.,Michael
No he's right.,Ex-client
"Accept it, why would he come back?",Dwight
"Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.",Michael
That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.,Dwight
"Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.",Michael
"Oh, OK. Well when it's up, I'll check it out, and if it really cuts costs maybe we'll come back.",Ex-client
"Great, the magic of the gift basket.",Michael
That I don't care about as much. Let me know when the site's up.,Ex-client
"OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic.",Michael
Proceed straight.,GPS
"[in Michael's car] Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.",Dwight
"I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.",Michael
"That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.",Dwight
"That is a very good point, Dwight.",Michael
Make a right turn.,GPS
"Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.",Dwight
"No, it said right, it said take a right.",Michael
"No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.",Dwight
Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right. [turns right],Michael
It can't mean that! There's a lake there!,Dwight
The machine knows where it is going!,Michael
This is the lake!,Dwight
The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!,Michael
"No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake]",Dwight
"Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael!",Dwight
"Let go, let go of me!",Michael
"I got you, I got you! [Michael and Dwight reach the ground]",Dwight
[watching car get pulled from lake] You sure you're OK?,Michael
Fine.,Dwight
"Good, that is what's most important.",Michael
Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.,Dwight
"What a disaster, this whole thing.",Michael
I'll call a cab. [brings out cell phone],Dwight
"These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it.",Michael
"Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.",Dwight
"What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. 'I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy'. Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.",Michael
"[speaking on the cell phone] Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.",Dwight
Hang up. [Dwight hangs up] You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!,Michael
Yes!,Dwight
"We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand!",Michael
Take a stand!,Dwight
"So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.",Pam
"I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.",Ryan
Thanks.,Pam
I'd love to talk to you about it more.,Ryan
That'd be great.,Pam
Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?,Ryan
Oh... is it...,Pam
Wear something nice.,Ryan
No...,Pam
What?,Ryan
Um...,Pam
I just... I just wanted to have dinner.,Ryan
"I'm uh, I'm dating Jim.",Pam
You're kidding?,Ryan
We're together.,Pam
"That's... great, I... that's awesome.",Ryan
"Yeah, great.",Pam
"[grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these.",Ryan
OK great!,Pam
Cool.,Ryan
Great.,Pam
I guess he can't get any girl he wants.,Jim
Did you forget something? What happened to you guys?,Ex-client
"Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.",Michael
Oh what is this?,Ex-client
"It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.",Dwight
Maybe you should leave.,Ex-client
"Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches! [sits on couch]",Michael
"Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna [gets water from his clothes on the couch] Oops, sorry!",Dwight
"Look, my clothes are so wet!",Michael
"Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! [rubs shoes on couch]",Dwight
"[comes back with gift basket] Alright here you go, take it back!",Ex-client
It's been opened.,Michael
Yeah it was mine!,Ex-client
What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?,Michael
"Come on guys, get out of here!",Ex-client
WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?,Michael
"[enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!",Dwight
"I ate them OK, I ate the turtles, they're gone!",Ex-client
[leaving] We'll bill you.,Dwight
"May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.",Michael
That is not correct.,Ryan
Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.,Michael
You did what?,Oscar
"I drove my car into a [bleep] lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.",Michael
Into a lake.,Jim
Exactly!,Michael
Did you get any clients back?,Phyllis
"Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives. [looks at Ryan] Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.",Michael
"Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.",Michael
"I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did. And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie. ... It was two hundred dollars.",Ryan
You should come visit. The city is... amazing.,Ryan
I know. I love it there.,Jim
No. You don't know until you live there. There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.,Ryan
"Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.",Jim
"No. You can't imagine it, though. The energy when you're actually there. You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you. Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.",Ryan
Sounds great.,Jim
No. It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.,Ryan
Yeee... (grunts in frustration),Jim
"Yes. My old friend Ryan Howard is coming back today for some big presentation. Very, very excited. He is my protege. He is someone that I hand-raised, that I nurtured. Um... he is like a prime cut of veal whom I nourished with my milk. And now he is also my boss. So, win/win.",Michael
[pointing] Um... [camera reveals that 'RYAN' is crossed out on the 'Welcome Back RYAN banner'; 'A**HOLE' is now written in. Kelly is sitting next to the banner],Oscar
"Oh, Okay. Okay. Just...[Michael takes down banner, clears throat] Well, our old friend Ryan Howard is back, and we're going to give a little presentation about the future of our company. So please listen up. [awkward pause] All right.",Michael
[to Michael] Have a seat with everybody else.,Ryan
You don't want me to help?,Michael
"You don't know what I'm going to talk about. [Michael heads toward chairs] Actually, can you do me a favor?",Ryan
Yes?,Michael
Can you get me a cold water?,Ryan
I got it.,Pam
"That's all right, Pam. Michael's got it. [Michael and Ryan look at each other for 5 seconds]",Ryan
"[laughs] Um... yes, I'll be right back!",Michael
Thank you.,Ryan
"That was slightly harsh, don't you think?",Jim
"I spent three years, driving around, getting him yams and magic wands. He can get me water.",Ryan
"I think I know what's going on. Ryan believes that there is some sort of special 'boss water' that he gets to drink now. And there isn't. But, um... don't tell him. Don't tell him that. I don't want to jeopardize our friendship.",Michael
Ryan is causing some problems. And you were always good at handling him. What should I do to control him?,Michael
"Well, he's super-ticklish, I don't know if that helps.",Kelly
"I know, I know, no, what... something else.",Michael
"Oh, he's also super-insecure about his height.",Kelly
Uh-huh.,Michael
And he doesn't care about anybody but himself.,Kelly
Good.,Michael
"And don't have sex with him, 'cause if you do, the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time.",Kelly
My generation's all about hard work and accomplishment. Like... the moon landing. Or Vietnam. Rolling Stones. Greatest band ever.,Michael
You're forty-three. Mick Jagger's like sixty-five.,Oscar
"And still rockin', Oscar. One of the greatest all-time oldies was a little Oriental guy named Confucius. He literally invented the ancient Chinese secret. Here's some of his quotes. Confucius say, 'Man who farts in church must sit in his own pew.' Confucius say, 'Man with hand in pocket feel cocky all day.' Confucius also say, 'Virgin like balloon. One prick, all gone!'",Michael
Did you Google Confucius and just print out the first thing you saw?,Oscar
"No, I skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page. Which proves that he was old, but he was also hilarious.",Michael
"[sighs, whistles] Michael, please would you not email while we're having lunch?",Jan
I'm not. It's solitaire. See?,Michael
BlackBerry. Why would anyone name something like this after a fruit? You wouldn't name an iPod after a fruit. [drops BlackBerry on desk] Excuse me while I type on my Banana. I'm gonna go to the Orange store and buy an Apricot computer. [thinks] Apple. [nods],Michael
This is going on the outside. The pipe cleaner needs to go through the corner. Do not tape those on.,Michael
"Hey, Michael.",Pam
Mmhmm.,Michael
Jan called and asked where you're going to meet for dinner. She wants you to call her.,Pam
I'm a little busy right now. Could you BlackBerry me a message?,Michael
Sure.,Pam
"Michael doesn't know how to work his BlackBerry. So when he says BlackBerry me a message, he means write it on a Post-it note and stick it to his BlackBerry.",Pam
"Okay, everyone, I have a conference call, but after that, I'm going to lead a BlackBerry tutorial for anyone who's having any problems. Who here's set theirs up? [Jim and Andy raise their hands; Phyllis half-raises hers. Ryan notices that Michael does not raise his] Great. Well, I will see the rest of you at 2:30.",Ryan
"You didn't set up your BlackBerry, Dwight?",Jim
"Yes, I did, but I do not intend to use it. It is pointless technology.",Dwight
As opposed to...,Jim
Printing press. Tractor. Mechanical thresher. Telephone. Airplane. The only inventions that matter.,Dwight
What about cars?,Jim
They fall under the category of airplanes.,Dwight
"They do? So, cars are flightless airplanes.",Jim
Correct.,Dwight
Got it. They're like the penguins of the airplane family.,Jim
That's an excellent analogy.,Dwight
Thanks.,Jim
"Hey, Dwight, what about vaccines?",Pam
[scoffs] Vaccines are for chumps!,Dwight
My mom didn't believe in vaccines. I got my smallpox the old-fashioned way. And I survived. So... joke's on you hospitals.,Dwight
"[Creed is using the toaster as a mirror, and touching up his hair with a Sharpie and a comb] The one advantage to being older is that I know a few things about a few things, and I am young enough to not forget them. And old enough to know the difference between the two. I am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws, but young enough to date college girls. But old enough to know better. I'm at a perfect age. I could die now. But I won't, because I am young.",Michael
Sup? [rolls into kitchen on a skateboard],Creed
"Hi, Creed, what's up?",Kevin
"Just boardin', you know how we do. [flips skateboard up]",Creed
I... like your hair. I don't know if I told you.,Oscar
"Oh, thanks ese. So, what are you guys doing?",Creed
What do you mean?,Kevin
"To look younger, so the kid doesn't replace you with machines.",Creed
I think I'll just take my chances.,Oscar
"Suit yourself. But, if it were me, Botox [points at Oscar], wig [points at Kevin].",Creed
Wha...,Kevin
"And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They are unreadable. They're just numbers and boring and blech. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? [everyone groans] Doesn't have to be a racecar. Use your imagination.",Michael
"There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away. And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay. I believe she thinks she saw it.",Jim
"I saw it. I saw it, and it was amazing! Who said I didn't see it? Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!",Pam
We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white? [screen saver box hits the wall],Michael
Dah! Come on!,Andy
Yeah! I know. I know. It's bland.,Michael
It's never gonna happen.,Oscar
"Dude, you gotta believe.",Kevin
"Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?",Michael
[to Pam] Wait for it.,Jim
"Like, something that you have to look for. Sort of a 'Where's Waldo.' [screensaver box hits the corner of the screen]",Michael
Oh! Yes!,Everyone
[everyone gets up and leaves the conference room] Alright. Alright. Let's quit while we're ahead.,Michael
That was so awesome.,Kevin
That was awesome. Thank you.,Michael
Some days I am just on fire. What can I say?,Michael
Hey... there he is.,Meredith
"Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?",Jim
I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.,Meredith
"Oh, please, it was my pleasure. Well we all came, so...",Jim
"Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut.",Meredith
Haha...,Jim
"Anyway, I have this Sharpie...",Meredith
Uh-huh.,Jim
And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?,Meredith
MmmHmm...,Jim
[lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?,Meredith
Oh yeah.,Jim
[whispers] I'll read this when I get home.,Meredith
Alright...,Jim
Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about. Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.,Pam
"Oh, does he?",Michael
He does.,Pam
"Mmmmmm. Okay. Attention. Earthlings. I have some news. Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep. Okay. Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you.",Michael
Whoops. Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?,Jim
And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.,Michael
"Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan. It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it's birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City's finest, and I do not mean policemen...",Michael
"The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company. Wow! Watch out Dwight.",Michael
That's ridiculous. I'm not going to be beaten by a website.,Dwight
Actually it sounds like you are.,Jim
Really? 'Cause Ryan says so?,Dwight
"If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?",Kelly
No. It doesn't. I'll find out tonight.,Michael
"Yes, please let us know.",Stanley
"I can make more sales than a computer. In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.",Dwight
Waste of time.,Angela
"What's that, pipsqueak?",Michael
Waste of time. The website's going to win.,Angela
You believe a computer can beat me?,Dwight
"I don't care, but yes.",Angela
Well I will prove you wrong.,Dwight
"I don't care, and you won't.",Angela
We'll see.,Dwight
"I won't be watching, and I won't.",Angela
Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat. It's very complicated. It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela. Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.,Pam
"Stanley, you're dancing!",Phyllis
No I'm not.,Stanley
"Yeah. I created a website. Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet. This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.",Ryan
I told you I don't want you doing these things in here. You can use your own office or do it in the hall.,Voice of Thomas Dean
"Convergence. Viral marketing. We're going guerrilla. We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street. Wall Street. I don't want to reinvent the wheel here. In other words, it is what it is. Buyin' paper just became fun.",Ryan
And this is where I will record your sales.,Andy
Hmm. Very nice. Very nice.,Dwight
"And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.",Andy
Or zipadeedoodaah.,Jim
I can't tell if he's mocking me.,Andy
Just ignore him.,Dwight
"Ehh, can't do that. Really hard for me to let things go.",Andy
I was... mocking.,Jim
Thank you.,Andy
I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.,Dwight
Yes like a chime or a bell...,Andy
Or a gong.,Jim
Go to my car. Open the trunk. Inside you will see many pelts. Under the smallest one is a case. Inside that case is a bear horn. Bring it to me.,Dwight
Yes!,Andy
Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?,Kevin
Lunch party? It's supposed to say launch party! What is wrong with you?,Angela
"Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw. So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we're gonna try out some new things today.",Phyllis
So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?,Phyllis
I feel angry. Angry at you. Angry at you for doing something stupid. Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.,Angela
"I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.",Phyllis
It is awful. You've made this day awful!,Angela
Maybe you could just change the U into an A.,Kevin
"Then it would say lanch party, Kevin. Would it really be better if it said lanch party?",Angela
"Ohh, lunch party.",Michael
It's supposed to say launch!,Angela
"Okay, wow! Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.",Michael
I care!,Angela
"Plan a party, Angela. Oh! And the entire world will see it. Oh! And here's $65.00 for your budget. Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down. Oh. And your cat's still dead.",Angela
Twenty seconds to go time.,Andy
Got it. Carb up.,Dwight
Really? Power gel?,Jim
"Hey, you wanna win? You gotta fuel like a winner.",Dwight
Okay. We start. As soon as I make... this shot. Aaannnddd go!,sAndy
"Uhyeaahhh! Hello, Susan? Dwight Schrute.",Dwight
What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?,Jim
Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.,Dwight
What?,Jim
He's going through a break-up.,Pam
"Yeah, I'm aware of that. But he's also being super annoying. And I'm not a perfect person.",Jim
[blowing air horn] Yeah!,Andy
"Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines.",Dwight
What kind of prank are you thinking?,Pam
What if I told you I could offer free shipping? Sure. I'll hold.,Dwight
[on monitor] Who am I?,DunMiff/sys
[on monitor] You tell me.,DwightKSchrute
[dictating to Pam] Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.,Jim
[on monitor] Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.,DunMiff/sys
[on monitor] How do I know this isn't Jim?,DwightKSchrute
[on monitor] What is a Jim?,DunMiff/sys
It appears that the website has become alive. This happens to computers and robots sometimes. Am I scared of a stupid computer? Please. The computer should be scared of me! I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months. You heard me right. I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.,Dwight
Okay.,Michael
Yes it's too tight.,Pam
Waaay too tight.,Kelly
Really?,Michael
This is why I'm here?,Oscar
Why is it so tight?,Kelly
It's the European cut.,Michael
Is just looks bad.,Angela
"Umm... hey. Ah, what's hanging?",Michael
Setting up the web-cam for the party.,Tech Guy
Oh good. Okay cool. How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?,Michael
Depends... how much have you eaten already today?,Kelly
"I had um, one of those danishes.",Michael
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.,Pam
You had carbs? That's awful.,Kelly
"Uh, just one second. We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available. It's Jan.",Pam
Why don't you wanna go tonight? What... all your friends are gonna be there. It'll be fun.,Michael
"[on phone] My friends? Michael, I was terminated.",Jan
Just...,Michael
Is it really that important to you?,Jan
Yeah.,Michael
Alright.,Jan
Thank you.,Michael
Go by yourself.,Jan
Na... no. No. If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.,Michael
Well...,Jan
Do I have your permission to invite Carol?,Michael
What? No Michael!,Jan
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the first... girl that popped into my head. I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.,Michael
Ohhhhhh!,Dwight
Website check please.,Andy
Three hundred and five.,Meredith
Three-oh-five. You my friend are winning handsomely.,Andy
Oop. It just made another sale. Three eighty.,Meredith
You my friend are in a very close second.,Andy
Four-oh-two.,Meredith
"Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady?",Andy
"What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.",Meredith
So. This is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now. Like twins.,Michael
Sure we'll go.,Jim
Alright. Well fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.,Michael
Oh I'm sorry. What?,Jim
One of the tickets is for him.,Pam
Just let me know who the winner is.,Michael
Not it.,Pam and Jim
Nope.,Jim
I won.,Pam
Definitely not. If anything it was a tie.,Jim
Tie goes to the girlfriend.,Pam
"No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what? Ah no! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit! Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman? Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone]",Dwight
How's it going?,Jim
Fine. Good.,Dwight
Yeah?,Jim
Yeah.,Dwight
You look a little worried.,Jim
I do not look worried.,Dwight
[on monitor] You do look worried.,DunMiff/sys
[on monitor] Here's a suggestion computer. I assume you read...,DwightKSchrute
"Here's a suggestion computer. I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one.",Pam
"Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything. And mastered the violin. Oop, and sold more paper.",Jim
I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons. These are worthless.,Angela
I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.,Phyllis
"Phyllis. These are spoooons. Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things. What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top. And we need knives, which have blades. Do you understand me now?",Angela
Yes.,Phyllis
Goodie.,Angela
Hey man.,Jim
What's up man?,Darryl
What's going on?,Jim
Make a delivery.,Darryl
Oh yeah?,Jim
Kelly ordered this online.,Darryl
What are you doing? I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.,Dwight
"But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, 'Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin.'",Kelly
Damnit Kelly! It knows! It knows what you did!,Dwight
Who knows?,Darryl
Return it! Return it now!,Dwight
Hey! How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk. Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.,Darryl
"Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.",Dwight
Who's it?,Darryl
Here you go.,Darryl
Thanks.,Kelly
So you still missing Ryan?,Darryl
Not so much anymore.,Kelly
Mmmmm.,Darryl
"I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them. What did I intend to do with them? Who knows? Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them.",Dwight
"Yes, Mr. Galliado. How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now? It's not important how I got your information. What is important is that you say yes. Good.",Dwight
Alright. I'm ready to go and I'm callin' shotgun.,Michael
I'm driving?,Jim
Yes. Thank you.,Michael
"Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.",Jim
"Oh yeah, you'd better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Byyyyyye. I love you. [kissing noise, kissing noise] I love ya Pam... okay. [singing] I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again. Yes I do. Tomorrow I'll be back. I'll be back. Tomorrow. Um... yeah. So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight?",Michael
Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.,Angela
"If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster. See you guys tomorrow.",Michael
Perfect. So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.,Dwight
[on monitor] Oh. I didn't realize we could use the leads we stole from Staples.,DunMiff/sys
"I'm sorry. Am, so sorry. I... yes. Uh, could you repeat that?",Dwight
Yesss! Ten reams for the US District Court! Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?,Dwight
No ! [blows air horn and dances],Andy
Huh?!,Dwight
Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!,Angela
Did you see the board?,Dwight
There's still an hour.,Angela
You ever read this? [holds up Green Eggs and Ham],Michael
"Yep. A long time ago, but, I liked it.",Jim
"Got it for Ryan. Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out. Figured...",Michael
Yeah.,Jim
Same sort of stuff in here.,Michael
It's not. It's different. But it's a good book.,Jim
Mmwa. Mmwa.,Michael
What was that?,Jim
Leaving Pennsylvania.,Michael
Oh. Two kisses.,Jim
One for me one for Jan.,Michael
Gotcha.,Jim
You guys should come over for dinner. You and Pam. That'd be fun. Friday?,Michael
That would be fun.,Jim
Wanna come over Friday?,Michael
Uhhh. Can't.,Jim
After work you guys...,Michael
"Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?",Jim
"Yes. Actually I will tell you right now. It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password. So...",Michael
Mmmkay...,Jim
What are you doing?,Michael
"Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.",Jim
No.,Michael
Yep.,Jim
"No, I'm sure that's not. Na...",Michael
"Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?",Jim
Yes.,Michael
Yep.,Jim
"Well the invitation says VIP's only. Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan? We're already in the city. The main part with the buildings. What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do tonight? And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up! Okay I'm going to throw up. I'm throwing up. You're making me throw up, Ryan.",Michael
You know what this is like? I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.,Michael
Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?,Michael
Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.,Jim
Yeah. I withdrew too.,Michael
Four! Three! Two! One!,Andy
Yes!,Dwight
Woo!,Andy
Woo!,Dwight
"After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it's path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams.",Andy
Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again. Announce it again.,Dwight
Fifty-two reams!,Andy
No no no the first part.,Dwight
Dwight has defeated the computer.,Andy
Hey. So. What do you think? I did it for you.,Dwight
I didn't ask you to do it for me.,Angela
You didn't have to.,Dwight
"How do you tell someone it's over? You send them a notarized letter, right? Well, what if the recipient is your notary?",Angela
"Hello, Pam.",Angela
Hello.,Pam
Hey. Do you have any men that you can fix me up with? I would like to have a relationship with a man.,Angela
Um... uh... I'll get back to you.,Pam
Let me know.,Angela
[on monitor] You beat me. You are the superior being.,DunMiff/sys
Alright who wants to party?,Michael
Why aren't you in New York?,Oscar
"Ohhh, what? Oh I think I faked Oscar out.",Michael
You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.,Stanley
I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving? And they could all go home early? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well who needs New York? Right? We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.,Michael
Thank you.,Angela
Nope nope nope no. This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight?,Michael
He beat the computer.,Andy
Oh hey! Good for you. Good for you. Scranton power. Alright you know what? Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on. Good.,Michael
"This was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about. But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home.",Michael
How we doing on time?,Michael
The party starts in an hour.,Angela
Good. These are some things that I would like to have happen.,Michael
"Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?",Angela
Mmmhmm.,Michael
Something made of ice?,Angela
Those are just things. This is how I want it to feel.,Michael
"Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?",Angela
"I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important...",Michael
Chocolates? Someone famous?,Angela
Yes,Michael
Cool music.,Angela
Uh...,Michael
Confetti.,Angela
I want it...,Michael
Go-Go dancers?,Angela
"I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, 'Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?'",Michael
I can't do this.,Angela
Yes you can.,Michael
I can't do it.,Angela
Yes you can. I know you can. I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it. Who else could do this?,Michael
Okay. Okay.,Angels
No seriously. Is there anyone else who could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza!,Michael
What do you think of Angela?,Andy
I think she's efficient.,Dwight
"No, not like that, as a woman. W-O-M-A-N.",Andy
I hadn't noticed.,Dwight
You hadn't noticed she's a woman?,Andy
[impatient sigh],Dwight
"I hear she's single and ready to mingle. I'm thinking about making a play for her. What do you think? Crazy, right?",Andy
I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.,Dwight
Isn't that part of the fun?,Andy
No. I think you should date Kelly.,Dwight
"She works here too, how is that any different?",Andy
"Uh, she works in the annex. You're also welcome to date Toby.",Dwight
[raised eyebrows] Okay.,Andy
Good news.,Michael
We get to go home?,Stanley
"Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?",Michael
[murmurs of approval],All
Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe? Or Pizza by Alfredo?,Kevin
Same thing.,Michael
"No, no.",Kevin
[disagreeing with Michael],All
You know what? I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.,Michael
"Oscar, talk to him.",Kevin
"Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places. Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste. Which one did you order from?",Oscar
Pizza by Alfredo.,Michael
[shouts of disapproval],All
"Okay, okay, what's better? A medium amount of good pizza? Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?",Michael
Medium amount of good pizza.,All
"[sighs, walks back into office]",Michael
"Oh no, it's bad. It's real bad. It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.",Kevin
You can pick one of these things. It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.,Phyllis
It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.,Angela
[Balls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face],Phyllis
Ow!,Angela
That seemed to shut her up.,Phyllis
Are you looking for dinner and a movie? Because you're not going to find it in that box. [Camera pans to Kevin giving an 'are you kidding me?' look],Andy
"Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box.",Andy
"Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying?",Andy
What?,Angela
Hello.,Andy
"I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window. So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice. And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.",Angela
"They say you should never mix business with pleasure. Really? Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.",Andy
Yup.,Michael
The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.,Pam
You don't have to say it like that.,Michael
I said it normal.,Pam
Hey,Michael
"Hey. Sixty-three fifty, and that's not including tip.",Pizza guy
"Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.",Michael
The half off coupon only applies to orders of two pizzas.,Pizza guy
"Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.",Michael
"I don't care what you told them on the phone, that's our policy.",Pizza guy
You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?,Michael
It's not pizza.,Oscar
"Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon.",Michael
[shrugs],Pizza guy
[sarcastic shrugging of shoulders] What do you mean hmm-um?,Michael
Not my problem.,Pizza guy
"It is your problem. That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off. End of story.",Michael
"Great story. It's sixty-three fifty, and that's not including tip.",Pizza guy
I'm not giving that to you.,Michael
Well then you're not getting you're pizzas.,Pizza guy
"No, no you're not going anywhere. You're staying here until we figure this out.",Michael
What?,Pizza guy
"You know what? This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people. I don't care if it's pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through. You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you? Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room. Right now, get in the conference room.",Michael
I'm not going in there.,Pizza guy
"Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza. Please, thank you.",Michael
This is stupid.,Pizza guy
"No, you don't even know what stupid is. It's about to get all stupid up in here.",Michael
You find anything?,Stanley
We think it's a straight forward kidnapping.,Kevin
"Stanley, could you look up 'accomplices'?",Oscar
Why can't you guys do it?,Stanley
Because we're looking up jail time.,Oscar
Fine.,Stanley
I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.,Dwight
"Yeah, I know that guy. He's that farmer that grows really crappy weed.",Pizza guy
You ready to give me my discount now?,Michael
No.,Pizza guy
"Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?",Michael
What kind of business is this?,Pizza guy
We're a paper company. The best paper company in the whole wide world.,Dwight
"Alright, Dwight, knock it off. You better think about what you are doing young man.",Michael
You better think about what you're doing.,Pizza guy
"No! I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything. You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?",Michael
Sales?,Pizza guy
"Yeah sales, you sell pizza. Last time I checked that's called sales.",Michael
You're such a loser.,Pizza guy
What did you just call him?,Dwight
A loser.,Pizza guy
What did you say?,Dwight
A loser.,Pizza guy
"Alright stop, stop making him say it! You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.",Michael
"I can make him talk, Michael.",Dwight
"Michael, Michael",All
Stop talking all at once!,Michael
You need to let him go.,Jim
Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?,Michael
Yes.,Jim
"You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.",Michael
"Yes, but not by kidnapping.",Jim
"I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want.",Michael
As a hostage.,Jim
I think you're over-thinking it.,Michael
I think you're under-thinking it.,Jim
"Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...",Michael
Ransom.,Jim
"Trouble. Okay, alright.",Michael
What did he say?,Jim
He said no.,Michael
"So, we should let him go.",Jim
"No, no.",Michael
Okay.,Jim
"Listen up kid. [pops balloon with his hands] I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.",Dwight
I have to hang these.,Angela
Why are you looking at her like that?,Pizza guy
Hey!,Dwight
What's going on?,Kevin
Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.,Jim
"Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?",Michael
"We're getting hungry out there. We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat. We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.",Kevin
"I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.",Angela
I think it looks good.,Meredith
That's why you're not in charge Meredith.,Angela
"Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice.",Andy
"How did you, um, where did you...",Angela
"It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.",Dwight
Will you help me put it over there?,Angela
Yes I will.,Andy
Okay.,Angela
Excuse me.,Andy
I stole it!,Andy
Thank God.,Oscar
"Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes. You just have to wave and introduce yourself.",Pam
I'll just wave and introduce myself.,Michael
"Hey, quick question. If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?",Jim
I'm all over it.,Pam
Okay.,Jim
What have we got here?,Jim
Good pizza.,Kevin
"Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?",Jim
Different stuff.,Kevin
Which one's this? Perfect.,Jim
"Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?",Jim
"Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.",Pam
And that's when I knew. You?,Jim
"You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired.",Pam
That was the moment that you knew you liked me?,Jim
Yep.,Pam
"Wow, can we make it a different moment?",Jim
Nope.,Pam
Can I start talking? Is this thing on? Give me a signal when you want me to start.,Manager
"And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.",Ryan
"Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that [bleep]hole.",Michael
Always a jokester. How about that image? Crystal clear.,Ryan
"If anyone out there is listening, I'm being held here against my will. I'm a minor.",Pizza guy
Ow! What are you doing?,Angela
You said your upper back itched.,Andy
I didn't ask you to scratch it.,Angela
"Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you.",Andy
I'm not dating you.,Angela
"So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested.",Andy
[smiles],Dwight
"But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down.",Andy
[kicks open bathroom door] If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!,Dwight
"Hey, have you seen Jim?",Michael
I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.,Kevin
Ahh-chaa!,Dwight
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?",Michael
I'm just scaring him. The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.,Dwight
"I can hear you, man.",Pizza guy
"Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!",Dwight
"Hey, hey, hey stop it. Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no. I kidnapped a kid.",Michael
"You had to, what other choice did you have?",Dwight
I could have paid for the pizza.,Michael
"Well, yeah.",Dwight
"Oh my God, oh my God.",Michael
This is Michael.,Michael
"Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.",Ryan
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.,Michael
Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... [Michael hangs up on Ryan],Ryan
"[to Dwight] Mmm-kay. I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.",Michael
What will you do?,Dwight
I will open the door.,Michael
Yeah.,Dwight
"And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.",Michael
"So, I'm paying full price?",Dwight
Yes.,Michael
"Here we go, sixty-five. You know what? There's two more.",Dwight
"See ya, drive safely.",Michael
[pizza guy flips him off] Okay.,Michael
Now what?,Dwight
"Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.",Michael
"Alright. Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.",Dwight
"Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time.",Michael
"A toast, better make it good. To avoiding a class two felony charge.",Jim
Ah-ha.,Pam
"[answers two ringing phones] Hello, hey hang on a second. Hello, hang on.",Andy
"[Andy plus two voices on the phone singing] If you change your mind, I'll be first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If you need me let me know, gonna be around. If you got no place to go, if you're feeling down. If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey I'm still free, take a chance on me. Gonna do my very best, and that ain't no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try. Take a chance on me, that's all I ask of you Angela. Take a chance on me.",Andy
Hey how'd it go?,Voice #1 on phone
"Yeah, what'd she say?",Voice #2 on phone
"I don't know yet, I have to call you back.",Andy
You have to give us something...,Voice #1 on phone
I'll call you back.,Andy
I have to go clean up after the party.,Angela
What a horrible day.,Michael
Blah.,Dwight
Bluh.,Michael
Uhh.,Dwight
"Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth. I'd really like some sushi. I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today. And you know what?",Michael
What?,Dwight
I'm going to get it.,Michael
Coopers has calamari.,Dwight
"Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.",Michael
Tokyo?,Dwight
New York. Wanna go?,Michael
Yes.,Dwight
"Alright, you drive.",Michael
Okay.,Dwight
Nice.,Dwight
Here we go.,Michael
Woo-hoo.,Dwight
Mmm.,Michael
Yum.,Dwight
"I'm sorry, you guys are going to have to leave.",Bartender
"Hey, you know what? [Michael and Dwight grab plates of sushi] Come on, come on, let's go.",Michael
"Hey, you're the Scranton guy.",Man
Guilty.,Michael
I liked your statement tonight.,Man
"Oh, thanks. This is the guy that beat the computer.",Michael
"Oh, very cool. It was funny to see Ryan all embarrassed by that.",Man
Yeah.,Michael
See you later.,Man
Later on.,Dwight
"[mocking Ryan] I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed. I got egg all over my face.",Michael
And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.,Dwight
"I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot.",Michael
I started a fire with my cheese pita.,Dwight
I made it with my cheese pita.,Michael
I date Indian girls.,Dwight
"I started a fire, I started a fire.",Michael
"Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.",Dwight
"And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody...",Michael
"I don't get that, I don't understand that.",Dwight
"Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh.",Michael
Wanna head back?,Michael
"Yeah, let's go.",Dwight
"[steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks]",Ryan
[Dwight come into office unshaven] What?,Dwight
Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.,Jim
It's called being a man. You should try it sometime.,Dwight
How long have you been a man?,Jim
"I was born a man, Halpert.",Dwight
That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.,Jim
"I stopped shaving because my girlfriend broke up with me. Am I in pain? Hell, yeah. But I'll tell you something, I thrive in pain. I love pain. To me, pain is not pain at all. No. It is pure pleasure. And I hate pleasure. Almost as much as I love pain. So, yeah, I'm in pain.",Dwight
[to Dwight] What do you think of Angela? There's just something about her. All that strength and steeliness and righteousness all wrapped up tight and shoved into a tiny little delicate frame.,Andy
"No. I will not be playing it 'cool' [makes air quotes] with Angela. Let me tell you a little story. When I was seventeen, I was waitlisted at my number one school. Even though I was a legacy, and I had like a thousand extra-curriculars, mostly drama, madrigals, barbershop club, I was waitlisted. Did I wait, on that list? No, I did not. I busted into the admissions office and I [singing] sang them all the reasons they should admit me to the school [end singing]. And guess what? I. Got. In. And here's the kicker. That school? Cornell.",Andy
What's wrong with me?,Michael
Excuse me?,Pam
"I want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me. [Pam stares and nods] Don't avoid this. I know you're dying to say it, so just say it.",Michael
Sometimes your laziness borders on incompetence.,Pam
"What, no. No. Okay, bags. I have bags under my eyes, Pam. I didn't see it at home, I didn't see it in the bathroom, I didn't see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light...",Michael
"[interrupting] The city mirrors, or the...?",Pam
"The big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles? The big round things.",Michael
The ones for drivers to check their blind spots?,Pam
"Yes. I have bags under my eyes, and I can't go to New York like this! What do I do? What do I do?",Michael
Put cold tea bags on your eyes.,Pam
Really?,Michael
Yeah.,Pam
That's it?,Michael
Mmhmm.,Pam
All right! Martha Stewart! You can be Martha Stewart's receptionist! Very good! I will be tea baggin' it. Nn... no.,Michael
"[tea bags on eyes] Do I feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that I was invited to? Not at all. Because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this. Of course, at that point, I will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into. What are you gonna do?",Michael
"I'm a little mad, that I don't get to go to the party in New York. But that's mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage.",Kevin
"I was going to be in New York tonight, to go to the Met, but I had to cancel. Because Angela's party is mandatory.",Oscar
"I go to New York all the time, to visit my buddy Frank. He's a mole person.",Creed
"Angela, what kind of music?",Meredith
Uh... something cool that Ryan doesn't know about yet.,Angela
How am I supposed to know what that is?,Meredith
"I don't know, but standing here's not going to give you the answer. Go.",Angela
"Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states. Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm's party in Buffalo. Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d'oeuvres platter. And Denise proves that with every party she throws. Oh, and Denise? Stop telling people your hair's naturally curly. We all know you get perms.",Angela
"Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the person's will, so Michael asported him. [giggles] Have you ever been aspor...",Kevin
Don't.,Oscar
"Hey. The way I see it, it's getting late, and the only thing standing between you and a warm bed is my friend's pizza discount. So whattaya say? [pizza guy stares] Oh, so that's how it's gonna be. Well, I can stay here all night if I have to. I've done it before.",Dwight
I'm not scared of you.,Pizza guy
"In every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you don't know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza.",Kevin
"The lady cop acted like she'd never pulled someone over for driving too slow. And I tried to get out of it with the famous Toby Flenderson 10,000 watt smile. [smiles] It didn't work.",Toby
Damn it.,Toby
Is that traffic school?,Kelly
Yeah.,Toby
Because we're not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work.,Kelly
Yeah.,Toby
"Because yesterday when I was taking an online quiz about trying to find my ideal weight for my frame, you said that was inappropriate.",Kelly
I remember.,Toby
Just reiterating what you said to me.,Kelly
Thanks Kelly.,Toby
You know the octagon sign means stop.,Oscar
Colorblind.,Toby
"An octagon is a shape. You can see shapes, can't you?",Oscar
It's out of context. It's not the same as driving.,Toby
Coat! [throws coat at Pam],Michael
"Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.",Pam
Steak! Where's my steeaaak?,Michael
"He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character.",Pam
Get me Armani.,Michael
A suit?,Pam
On the phone.,Michael
Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.,Pam
Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are. [breaks into laughter],Michael
I owe you an apology.,Michael
You finished the movie.,Pam
Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you.,Michael
No. Go ahead.,Pam
"Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle.",Michael
Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby... He's gonna try to kill me.,Pam
So this one goes with my eyes and this one goes with your eyes. People have said I have very pretty eyes.,Micahel
You do.,Jan
I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine.,Michael
"Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.",Jan
We already have a sofa. So why do---,Michael
A futon's not a sofa.,Jan
It... folds up. You've only seen it flat.,Michael
"I know what a futon is, Michael.",Jan
I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost?,Michael
It costs what it costs.,Jan
No--- don't... that doesn't even mean anything.,Michae
We have gone through this.,Jan
"Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.",Michael
It's just that you say it's gonna cost what it costs--- [phone rings],Michael
"[on the phone] Michael, it's Ryan for you.",Pam
Conniving little runt. Put him through.,Jan
"Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!",Michael
[on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.,Ryan
"Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.",Michael
I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.,Ryan
"Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.",Michael
"Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.",Ryan
"[looking at nothing] Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.",Michael
"[talking on phone] Sure, I can hold.",Jim
"[picks up phone] Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!",Dwight
Hey Dwight.,Jim
"None of your business, Jim.",Dwight
Do you run the bed and breakfest?,Jim
It is not a B and B.,Dwight
"Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.",Dwight
Does the Department of Health know about this?,Jim
"I'm not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.",Dwight
"Hello, I'm looking for a room.",Pam
"Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.",Dwight
It says here you cater to the eldery.,Pam
Where did you read that?,Dwight
Trip Advsior.,Pam
"Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.",Dwight
How many in your party?,Dwight
Two?,Pam
"We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?",Dwight
"So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.",Jan
"Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.",Michael
"Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?",Jan
"Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.",Michael
"One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.",Dwight
What about my cherub figurine?,Angela
You took that with you.,Dwight
"No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.",Angela
"You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.",Dwight
Fine.,Angela
"My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.",Dwight
"The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?",Kevin
"You can not, I have a thing tonight.",Michael
Dammit.,Kevin
"Uh, Michael.",Jim
What?,Michael
"That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.",Jim
"Oh no, I have a thing tonight.",Michael
Darn it!,Jim
Shoot!,Pam
How about this weekend?,Michael
"No, can't.",Jim
"We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.",Pam
"Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.",Michael
Where are you going out tonight?,Jim
You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.,Michael
I wouldn't understand or a secret?,Jim
"You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret.",Pam
"I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will--[notices camera]-- it will be that easy.",Michael
"I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.",Jim
The Beets Motel.,Pam
"The Beets Motel? That is, wow.",Jim
Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!,Pam
How are you doing this?,Jim
I don't know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car],Pam
Oh my gosh.,Pam
"I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.",Michael
What's going on here?,Nick
"Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.",Michael
We're a legit operation with a license from the city I can show you. We pay minimum wage against commision---,Nick
"No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!",Michael
"We have three rooms, each with a different theme.",Dwight
What are the themes?,Pam
"American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.",Dwight
Irrigation.,Pam
Nice.,Jim
"I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?",Dwight
Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.,Jim
No.,Dwight
Not even Harry Potter?,Jim
"No. Jim, come on.",Dwight
But you promised.,Mose
"Mose, bags! Now!",Dwight
"Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.",Dwight
Everybody in the conference room. In 5 minutes.,Nick
These meetings are useless.,Michael
"I just want to remind you to stick to the script. Improving the work. So, make the call, say the lines, make the sale. Got it?",Nick
Very inspirational. [laughter],Michael
We're offering a $50 bonus tonight to the guy with the most sales. Ok.,Nick
Or a woman.,Co-Worker 1
Or a trained seal. [laughter],Michael
"You could make jokes when you've made a sale there rookie, ok? [laughter ends]",Nick
"Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6.",Jim
What?,Pam
"Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.",Jim
"You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.",Jim
"Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!",Dwight
"Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?",Michael
"[on the phone] Yes, who is this?",Stanely
I'm just calling because you responded positively to the---,Michael
Michael?,Stanely
...Stanley?,Michael
Why are you calling me here at home?,Stanley
"[Spanish accent] Senor, are you happy with your---",Michael
"Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?",Stanley
[speaking with a different voice] Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?,Michael
"Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up]",Stanley
"[on the phone] When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.",Stanley
Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.,Michael
[hangs up phone] My office.,Nick
You bet.,Michael
"Just dial the number on the sheet and stick to the script. Say those words exactly, got it? I don't know why we have to keep on having this conversation.",Nick
"Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---",Michael
A few more minutes is a waste of our time.,Nick
It is not a waste of our time.,Michael
This is a trading game.,Nick
No.,Micael
You give a quick pitch. You make the sale. You move on. That's how Vikram does it.,Nick
Vikram doesn't have my people skills.,Michael
"Good for Vikram, because he out-sells you every night.",Nick
"Well, I hope this conversation has helped.",Michael
"[reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. 'Harry?' It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.",Dwight
What did you get tonight?,Michael
"Oh it looks like mixed masala, eggplant, and rice.",Vikram
"Oh, that looks good.",Michael
"Oh, and what about you? Peanut butter flavor again?",Vikram
I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.,Michael
Enjoy.,Vikram
Thank you.,Michael
I was a surgeon back home.,Vikram
Really?,Michael
Oh yeah.,Vikram
Wonder what I would've been back home?,Michael
Well this is your home.,Vikram
"I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.",Michael
"Uhh, no.",Vikram
I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.,Michael
"[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?",Jim
Yeah. Coward.,Pam
[Pam sees Mose in an outhouse] Oh my God. What century is this?,Pam
"You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator.",Michael
"Dude, you should review movies. [other co-workers agree]",Co-Worker 2
I actually wrote a movie.,Michael
Really?,Co-Worker 3
"I'm writing one, yeah.",Michael
What's it about?,Co-Worker 3
"Um, sort of a spy, thriller...",Michael
"What's so captivating? [everyone stops talking, go back to work] I like captivating things. And this must be really captivating because it's keeping you off the phones. I mean time is your money, that's how I know how captivating it is. Because how much time you spend talking.",Nick
"[Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn.",Pam
"[Jim knocks on Dwight's door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare?",Dwight
Hey Dwight.,Jim
"Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose.",Dwight
Does Mose have nightmares?,Jim
Oh yes. Ever since the storm.,Jim
Is everything satisfactory with your stay?,Dwight
"Yeah, yeah.",Jim
Great.,Dwight
"Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.",Jim
Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.,Dwight
"Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]",Jim
"Yeah, so we're all gonna go out for a beer. Do you wanna come?",Co-Worker 2
"We'd love for you to come, Michael.",Co-Worker 3
"Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.",Michael
"All right, next time dude.",Co-Worker 2
"Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin'?",Michael
"You drive, I had too much wine.",Jan
Okay. How's yoga?,Michael

Good night.,Michael
Good night.,Vikram
"Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you?",Pam
Pam.,Dwight
You okay?,Jim
I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in],Dwight
Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?,Ryan
"Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?",Ryan
Um... that wasn't much of an introduction.,Michael
"Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.",Ryan
"Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!",Michael
"Yes I forgot about Ryan's presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.",Michael
"And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.",Michael
Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?,Ryan
Why?,Michael
"You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?",Ryan
"No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.",Michael
I'm your boss.,Ryan
"My other boss, Mr. Figaro.",Michael
You have another job?,Ryan
What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.,Michael
Are you a cocktail waitress?,Jim
You can not have another job if it affects your work here.,Ryan
It won't.,Michael
"It did, all ready.",Ryan
"Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways. [Kelly laughs]",Michael
You're so funny.,Kelly
Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.,Ryan
I invited him.,Kelly
"It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.",Ryan
"There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.",Darryl
Okay. [makes out with Darryl],Kelly
"Hey, get off.",Darryl
"Umm, see you later tonight.",Kelly
I have plans later.,Darryl
"Okay, bye honey.",Kelly
How long until you actually get this presentation ready?,Ryan
"Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?",Michael
"You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.",Ryan
"Huh, okay.",Michael
What?,Ryan
"It's whoever, not whomever.",Michael
"No, it's whomever.",Ryan
"No, whomever is never actually right.",Michael
"No, sometimes its right.",Jim
Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students.,Creed
"No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.",Andy
"Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.",Oscar
Not a native speaker.,Michael
"I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.",Kevin
Do you really know which one is correct?,Ryan
I don't know.,Kevin
"It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject.",Pam
"Yeah, that sounds right.",Phyllis
"Well it sounds right, but is it?",Michael
How did Ryan use it? As an object?,Stanley
As an object.,Ryan
Ryan used me an object.,Kelly
Is he right about that?,Stanley
How did he use it again?,Pam
"It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.",Toby
Thank you.,Michael
"To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.",Toby
"No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.",Michael
"Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.",Ryan
"I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life. So, you are filming history.",Michael
"Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs. One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company---",Michael
Lipophedrine,Mr. Figaro
And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.,Michael
Never heard of it.,Mr. Figaro
"In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me. But the truth is, I can't do this.",Michael
Are you quitting?,Mr. Figaro
I am.,Michael
"Come back anytime, don't forget to disinfect your headset.",Mr. Figaro
"I was never in this for the money. But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me. I tried to live the dream. I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed. But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.",Michael
So.,Andy
What's up?,Pam
Me. All night. Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body.,Andy
You're being gross.,Pam
"Not from a male perspective. You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves.",Andy
What moves?,Pam
I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.,Andy
I can't believe that's not working.,Pam
Yeah.,Andy
"Um, I don't know if I really see you two together.",Pam
"Really? Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.",Andy
She's very religious.,Pam
"Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.",Andy
"Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.",Pam
"Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.",Andy
"That's right, you did.",Pam
Yeah.,Andy
"Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple. But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.",Pam
"Hey Kevin, you're a gambler right? A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.",Michael
I do gamble Michael.,Kevin
"Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don't know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things. Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that?",Michael
The mob.,Kevin
Do you know anybody in the mob?,Michael
[shakes head no],Kevin
"Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary.",Michael
What do you mean you have plans tonight?,Kelly
I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web.,Darryl
"Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me.",Kelly
My daughter.,Darryl
"Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops.",Kelly
That was cold.,Darryl
"[makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat]",Kelly
He's always been terrible with money.,Phyllis
I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.,Stanley
"Yeah, women be shoppin'.",Kevin
I can't believe he has a second job.,Meredith
He's not even good at his first one.,Oscar
Hey guys.,Michael
Shh.,Kevin
"What'cha talking about? [camera pans to each face in the break room] Okay, I know what's going on. You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think---",Michael
Michael.,Pam
"Hey, hey, hey.",Michael
"Michael, are you having money problems?",Oscar
"Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems?",Michael
You heard me correctly.,Oscar
"Oh, I hate monkeys.",Michael
"What's going on, why do you have a second job?",Pam
I don't have a second job. Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.,Michael
Doesn't Jan have money?,Pam
"I don't talk to my girlfriend about money. It is rude, and unsexual.",Michael
"True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.",Kevin
"I totally agree with you. But I don't have money problems, I don't. Alright, you know what? Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? [Michael holds up a bill, crumples it up, puts it back in his pocket]",Michael
You just put it back in your pocket.,Oscar and Stanley
"Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore.",Michael
"Hey, let's call this what it is.",Darryl
It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around. It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.,Darryl
"Well, I just need to know where this is going.",Kelly
"Hey, I like you. Oh yeah, what's not to like? But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course.",Darryl
"Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---",Kelly
"Slow down, think it over.",Darryl
"Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met. I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking? What kind of game is that?",Kelly
"Hey cuz, heard you're having money problems.",Creed
No you didn't.,Michael
"Listen, I've got the answer. You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.",Creed
"Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy. When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider.",Creed
"How would that help Creed? In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.",Michael
"You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts. Nobody just picks up 'get out of jail free' cards, those things cost thousands.",Creed
That is a good point.,Michael
"Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over. It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.",Creed
Like the witness protection program.,Michael
Exactly.,Creed
Not at all.,Oscar
"I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program. Fresh start, no debts, no baggage. I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton. I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That's the life.",Michael
I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!,Michael
"Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.",Oscar
"I didn't say it, I declared it.",Michael
"Still, that's not anything.",Oscar
This is a lot of credit card debt.,Oscar
"Yeah, tell me about it.",Michael
Mmm.,Oscar
"You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine.",Michael
"Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.",Oscar
"Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.",Michael
Twelve hundred dollars. What's a Core Blaster Extreme?,Oscar
"That is by far the best way to strengthen your core. This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist. It strengthens your entire core. Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it. I think that's how they got a core.",Michael
"I left a little present for Angela. I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together. I got game.",Andy
"Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.",Oscar
Mm-hm. That is so cool how you have my name at the top.,Michael
"The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.",Oscar
Right.,Michael
"This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.",Oscar
How do they do this so fast? Is this power-point?,Michael
"Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background] Angela.",Pam
"Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.",Oscar
"No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.",Michael
She has to know.,Oscar
"We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.",Michael
"Michael, this is a presentation tool.",Oscar
You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.,Michael
I'm done!,Oscar
"No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.",Michael
Jan is smart.,Oscar
She poses.,Michael
"Dwight, how's the hotel business?",Jim
Stupid.,Dwight
Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?,Jim
No.,Dwight
Maybe you should.,Jim
Maybe you should. Whatever.,Dwight
"We wrote a good review. Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.",Pam
The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.,Jim
Table making never seemed so possible.,Pam
You will never want to leave your room.,Jim
The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.,Pam
I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.,Dwight
We really did. It was fun.,Pam
"So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.",Oscar
[on phone] You're broke?,Jan
"Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying?",Michael
"[on phone] Michael, how did this happen? Where did all your money go? I don't, I don't get this. I really don't. I don't know how you could be so irresponsible. I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really. I don't know what more to say.",Jan
Jan.,Oscar
"[on phone] Yeah, what?",Jan
Michael left.,Oscar
"[on phone] Okay, where did he go?",Jan
I don't know.,Oscar
"[on phone] Well, is he coming right back?",Jan
I don't think so.,Oscar
[on phone] I'll be right there.,Jan
"What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.",Michael
"[to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.",Angela
Dwight.,Pam
Uhh-mmm [moaning],Dwight
Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?,Jim
[incoherent mumbling] No you didn't.,Dwight
"Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well, it was all about Pam.",Jim
Mmm-uh-mm [incoherent mumbling],Dwight
"Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Even weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.",Jim
"[sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away]",Dwight
"Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- [Jim grabs her face and kisses her]",Pam
"Ah, dinner. Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.",Jim
Okay.,Pam
Yeah?,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
Okay.,Jim
Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.,Pam
"Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food. In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.",Jim
"Jan, he went running that way.",Oscar
Alright. [throws her keys at Oscar],Jan
"[singing] Runaway train, never come back. Runaway and I'm never coming back.",Michael
Michael.,Jan
Hey Jan.,Michael
What's going on?,Jan
"Not much, what's up with you?",Michael
"Well, why are you sitting on a train? Where are you going?",Jan
I'm out of answers Jan.,Michael
What does that mean?,Jan
"I told you, no more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you.",Michael
"Michael, come on. Running away from your problems won't solve anything. You know that.",Jan
I don't know that.,Michael
"Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease. Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.",Jan
I'll stay off the grid.,Michael
"Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this. It's not that bad.",Jan
"Yeah it is, it is. I really messed up.",Michael
"Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone. I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.",Jan
That's really nice of you to say.,Michael
"Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me. By my side. Without even a thought. That's just who you are. I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me. And that is a guy worth staying beside. So, where's this train taking us?",Jan
I think the engineer left.,Michael
"[takes a ruler and shoves it between his desk and Jim's, knocking Jim's files on the floor] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies. Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.",Dwight
Don't sell your implants please.,Michael
I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.,Jan
That's nice though.,Michael
It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.,Jan
It looks cute though.,Michael
I used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time. They would say things like 'don't pay for six months' or 'you can transfer your account from another card'...,Michael
"No, [mumbling] I don't know.",Dwight
"Do you think I'll get any new ones? I could... [pause, eventually looks up at Dwight]",Michael
What?,Dwight
"What do you mean, 'what'?",Michael
What... [mumbling],Dwight
Were you listening to what I was saying?,Michael
I was aware that you were speaking.,Dwight
What is the matter with you?,Michael
What is the matter with... me?,Dwight
Yeah.,Michael
I'm... discombobulated.,Dwight
Yeah.,Michael
I need help.,Dwight
"All right, well, go find some. Get outa here, please. [Dwight sighs and leaves]",Michael
"Okay, you need to focus, Michael. You need to stop spending money.",Oscar
Yeah. What?,Michael
"I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?",Oscar
"Um, my CDs.",Michael
You have CDs?,Oscar
I do.,Michael
"Okay, good, okay. What bank?",Oscar
"My CDs are in a portfolio, a rather large portfolio, um, called Case Logic",Michael
[whispers] Case Logic.,Oscar
"And, um the Case Logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car. There is another smaller Case Logic portfolio clipped to my visor [Oscar vigorously shakes his head] What?",Michael
I'm asking about Certificates of Deposit.,Oscar
I've been putting money into CDs for years. I bought music that I didn't even like. No. [shakes head],Michael
I just think that...,Jan
I can't.,Michael
Why?,Jan
I can't go back to that.,Michael
I think you can. I... what?,Jan
I don't know if I can do that. I can't see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.,Michael
"All right, well then maybe there's another way, you know? I mean, we could just... we'll think of something else.",Jan
We will? I can't. I don't have an idea in my head.,Michael
"Well... well, we will.",Jan
I have...,Michael
We just will.,Jan
Okay. What? Um...,Michael
I have some ideas.,Jan
Tell me.,Michael
[laughs] I am not going to tell you yet.,Jan
"Well, please? I won't tell anybody.",Michael
"Oh, yes, you will.",Jan
"Yeah, I will.",Michael
"Gentlemen, a word. Look, you guys are my closest friends in this office.",Andy
Right back at ya.,Jim
"And as such, I come to you...",Andy
State your business!,Dwight
I am dying of lovesickness and horny-sickness.,Andy
That is impossible. Unless you mean gonorrhea.,Dwight
"I'm talking about Angela, okay? Did you hear what she was saying to Pam the other day?",Andy
"Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it. Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things. So... best to just lay off.",Dwight
No can do. I am itching all over with Angela-pox.,Andy
"Oh my God, you do have gonorrhea.",Jim
"Hey, Andy! Maybe this is one of those situations where you just have to do her to get her out of your system.",Phyllis
"Stay out of this, you!",Dwight
"Hey, fellas! And... lady.",Andy
I still do not have your reimbursement check.,Kevin
"That's not why I came over. I mean it's a week late, but... I just came over to say hi.",Andy
Hi.,Oscar
[waves] Hi.,Kevin
"Angela, you like lacrosse?",Andy
"Lacrosse, the sport?",Angela
Scranton U. Varsity's gonna scrimmage the J.V. squad. Should be pretty interesting. J.V. gets really amped.,Andy
"Well, I guess it's a big opportunity for them.",Angela
Yeah.,Andy
Yeah.,Angela
You wanna go?,Andy
No.,Angela
Because we could get some food...,Andy
No.,Angela
Afterwards at the...,Andy
"Andy, no. [Andy nods and starts backing away, Kevin giggles]",Angela
Still waiting on that check.,Andy
"Pam! You don't think he'll mind if we take the shampoo, do you? [holds up large bottle]",Jim
Mmm. Mmm-mmm. [shakes head 'no'],Pam
Okay.,Jim
"[Mose serves bacon] Thank you, Mose.",Pam
[clears throat] Everybody poops.,Mose
"Yes, they do.",Jim
There's no other... way to get rid of the food.,Mose
Where's Dwight?,Jim
Gone.,Mose
Where'd he go?,Pam
His day place.,Mose
The office.,Jim
What office?,Mose
Hmm.,Jim
"Mose, Angela hasn't been around here much lately, has she?",Pam
Angela?,Mose
Angela - she used to stay here sometimes?,Pam
Angela [leaves].,Mose
"[on trampoline] Cannonball! Lemon bomb! Jim, Pam, watch! Jim, Pam, watch! Jim, Pam, watch!",Mose
"Okay, we're watching, Mose!",Pam
"Okay, go Yankees! I'm a war hero!",Mose
"You're doin' great, buddy!",Jim
"Name's Mose, buddy! Dwight, can I stop? They're not even looking.",Mose
"Yeah, go ahead and stop. You guys, you should really be looking, he's working his ass off over here.",Dwight
"I'm sorry, did we or did we not pay for a show?",Jim
"Okay, go ahead, they're right.",Dwight
Large spins!,Mose
[not watching Mose] More spins.,Jim
"Arr, dammit! [throws saw at table he was working on]",Dwight
Helicopter!,Mose
"Yeah! Everything! Oh it's all good, it's all good. Phyllis!",Michael
Dancing babies!,Phyllis
Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!,Michael
"We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever. Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it's uh, not too shabby.",Michael
"Best ad ever. [sings in the tune of the 'Kit Kat theme song'] Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing?",Andy
Nobody tell him!,Jim
"What? No, why?",Andy
"You got it, you're so close!",Jim
[singing] Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce.,Andy
"Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...",Jim
Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.,Andy
Nope.,Jim
Football cream. Grr!,Andy
"Okay, it's football cream. It's football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?",Michael
I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.,Pam
"Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.",Michael
Hello hello!,Michael
"Hey, how ya doin'?",Ad guy 1
Michael Scott.,Michael
"Hey, Michael.",Ad guy 2
Regional manager.,Michael
"Hey Michael, nice to meet you",Ad guy 2
Excited to talk ideas.,Michael
"Let's do it, man.",Ad guy 1
"You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.",Michael
That sounds great.,Ad guy 1
"All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.",Michael
I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out?,Michael
Hoo hoo hoo-hoo!,Andy
He gives the best back rubs in the office.,Michael
"It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy [makes farting noise]. Not! You just got 'Nard dogged!",Andy
Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.,Michael
Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?,Stanley
Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.,Michael
"These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.",Michael
[looking at Oscar] Mama Bear!,Kevin
Who else?,Michael
"I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.",Jim
You playing that game again?,Jim
"Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.",Dwight
Oh it has losers.,Jim
I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around],Dwight
"[reading off piece of paper] Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison. But we zoom back further---",Michael
Okay I can tell that your time is valuable---,Ad guy 1
"Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...",Michael
"That all sounds really, really ambitious.",Ad guy 1
"Yeah, I know.",Michael
Why don't we show you what we did with the Nashua branch?,Ad guy 1
"Mmm. Okay. [commercial plays on laptop, peppy music in background]",Michael
That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks! [chuckles] Whoa.,Michael
That's what we came up with.,Ad guy 1
Well we can do better than that.,Michael
"Well the main part of the ad has to stay the same, actually.",Ad guy 2
"Yeah, it's the last five seconds where we have some leeway.",Ad guy 1
The waving?,Michael
"Well, no, no. You don't have to be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping. Sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. This is where you really get to be creative.",Ad guy 1
"I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking. Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?",Andy
"We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.",Dwight
We'll use code names.,Andy
"Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.",Dwight
That's not different enough.,Andy
Dwike?,Dwight
You have a call from Eddie Murphy.,Receptionist
Hello?,Ryan
"[on speakerphone, Eddie Murphy voice] Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek! [laughing] I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry.",Michael
What?,Ryan
"Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.",Michael
I told you not to call about small problems.,Ryan
"Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.",Michael
"That's good. They're creative, you're not.",Ryan
"I'm creative, Ryan.",Michael
"It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.",Ryan
"Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.",Michael
"Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?",Ryan
Yeah!,Michael
But I'm good at managing people who do sales .,Ryan
"Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.",Michael
"All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet.",Michael
"Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.",Michael
"Okay, when should we come back?",Ad guy 2
"How about never hundred hours, sir.",Michael
We were sent here to help out.,Ad guy 2
Okay I'm not going to argue with this guy. Let's go. Good luck dude.,Ad guy 1
Hey thanks. Thank you.,Michael
"[on phone] Michael, David Wallace. What is this about dismissing the ad people?",David Wallace
"Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.",Michael
I'm on Michael.,Ryan
"What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime.",Michael
This is weird.,David Wallace
I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it.,Michael
"Okay, I'll see it tomorrow.",David Wallace
"Okay. [hangs up phone] And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.",Michael
"Has anyone ever come up to you and said, 'You're not creative'?",Michael
Yes.,Dwight
"Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.",Michael
"Who are you talking to, specifically?",Jim
I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face],Kevin
When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.,Oscar
"I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around.",Meredith
"We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously. Phyllis, I'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.",Michael
[gasps] Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.,Phyllis
"Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.",Michael
Okay.,Phyllis
"Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?",Andy
She's crazy hot.,Creed
Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?,Andy
That's not happening.,Angela
I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.,Angela
Bye everyone.,Phyllis
Line it up Phyllis.,Michael
Get her Phyll.,Creed

What's rap?,Darryl
"Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix.",Michael
Great.,Darryl
News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.,Andy
Hey.,Jim
"No talk, I'm animating.",Pam
"Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.",Jim
Are you serious?,Pam
Yeah.,Jim
"Oh my God, he's really in pain.",Pam
[sighs],Jim
Who's that?,Pam
"Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever.",Jim
He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?,Pam
"Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---",Jim
Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.,Pam
Yep.,Jim
You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.,Pam
I... why don't we go back to this animation.,Jim
"No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.",Pam
"Ah, show me how this works.",Jim
Oh boy.,Pam
"[singing in different tune] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.",Darryl

"Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.",Michael
You just said you hated it.,Darryl
"No. I said I hate the, the style.",Michael

"Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.",Michael
Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.,Andy
"Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?",Michael
"[crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer.",Phyllis
That'a girl.,Michael
So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.,Phyllis
"Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?",Michael
[sobbing] No.,Phyllis
"Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? [Kevin hands her piece of tape]",Michael
"I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.",Jim
"Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet.",Pam
Okay. Do you want me to stay?,Jim
"No no, you can go home. I'm good.",Pam
"Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.",Jim

"Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.",Jim
Thank you.,Pam
You're welcome.,Jim
"I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.",Pam
Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.,Andy
"Andy, I can't hear this right now.",Dwight
"No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, 'Oh D, oh D.'",Andy
She called you D?,Dwight
Yeah. D for Andy.,Andy
Oh D.,Dwight
Oh D.,Andy
[whispers] Oh D.,Dwight
Oh D!,Andy
Ohhhhhh D! [laughing] Ohhhh D!,Both
I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay. [dials phone],Michael
[on phone] Yes?,Pam
"Pam, please clear my phone lines.",Michael
"Certainly. [makes beeping noises] Okay, clear.",Pam
They could call at any second now. [sighs] Oh God...I better call.,Michael
"[Ten days later] Well, it's been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!",Michael
[watching ad] Oh! [clapping and cheering],Everyone
Hey it seemed like a big hit.,Bartender
"No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.",Michael
"Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?",Jim
"Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.",Jim
"[Chariots of Fire theme plays] It all starts with an idea. But you can never tell where an idea will end up. [people passing a Corporate Memo around to each other] Because ideas spread, they change, grow. They connect us with the world.

[Dwight hands Phyllis paper that says 'You have a son, and it's me'] Because when push comes to shove we all deserve a second chance. [Stanley finds paper that says 'Turn your life around.

"All right! So, anybody else? No bad ideas. Everybody, let's keep 'em coming... oh, God. Okay, Toby?",Michael
"Well, you know how everyone fast forwards through ads these days? Well, what about an ad in slow motion. You know, if they fast forward through it, it'll just seem normal and it will catch your eye. Plus, uh, the slogan could be: Dunder Mifflin, we adapt to the pace of your business. [murmurs of approval by everyone but Michael]",Toby
"There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad.",Michael
I spent three years in advertising before I came here.,Toby
"And that is probably why most ads suck. [points to the ad men waiting outside the conference room] Oh, that's them! Those are the ad guys right there. All right, my very fortunate and creative group, go back to your desks and I will let you know when it is time to film. [everyone starts leaving the conference room] [loud whisper] Pam! Pam, come here for a second. Did you get the memo about dressing your best?",Michael
Yeah.,Pam
About dressing your best today?,Michael
"Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos.",Pam
"Cool. Cool, I just wanted to make sure you got it.",Michael
"Yeah, I get all the memos. [starts to leave]",Pam
"Okay, good. Good.",Michael
"This is Pam Beesly, representing our girl next door. Pretty but nothing special. You know, but she sort of keeps it real. What you might want to do, is if you could zoom in, like really quick zooms on her. Might be good. [walking away] Who else? [pointing] Oh, Creed... is the old guy over there. Don't look at him. You might want to use him to sort of get that Orville Redenbacher dynamic going.",Michael
Sure.,Ad guy 1
Right.,Ad guy 2
"And if not we can just make him disappear. [walks quickly over to Jim's desk] This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don't you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean.",Michael
Okay.,Jim
"So do, um, do sad, do the sad face.",Michael
I don't want -,Jim
"No, that's skeptical. Do sad.",Michael
Mmm...,Jim
"That's, that's a pirate movie. [Jim stares at Michael] That's annoyed. Well, he doesn't do very well under pressure.",Michael
[shakes head] Yeah... no. [Jim turns to Pam with an exaggerated sad face; Pam laughs. Dwight walks towards Michael and the ad men],Ad guy 1
"And anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace. Follow me! Let's get this movin'. [Dwight goes back to his seat, embarrassed]",Michael
"All right, let's start.",Michael
"All right! [sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...",Jim
"You are my producer, you are a suit. I am the creative genius. You take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free.",Michael
Yup.,Jim
"Now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a Sam Goody gift certificate...",Michael
Right.,Jim
...and we need to be done by 9 A.M. tomorrow.,Michael
Mmmhmm. Why don't you start by telling me what you got.,Jim
We start on a single blank sheet of paper.,Michael
Love it.,Jim
And we widen to reveal ancient Rome.,Michael
"Mm, can't do that.",Jim
"Okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb.",Michael
Definitely can't do that.,Jim
Bull[censored] man!,Michael
You know what?,Jim
This is bull[censored]!,Michael
"Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.",Jim
Ahhhh! [sweeps toys off his desk],Michael
"I'm just doing my job, man.",Jim
"If you don't let me pursue my artistic vision, I am going to walk!",Michael
Good! Fine! I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... [dialing phone],Jim
"No! No! Jim, Jim, don't, don't...",Michael
What? What?,Jim
"No, I can do it.",Michael
What?,Jim
"I can do it good. I can do it good. Please, don't. Please. [kneels in front of desk] Please give me it.",Michael
"Okay, make a commercial.",Jim
[taps on desk and starts to leave his office] Do you want this open or closed?,Michael
"Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]",Jim
"Hey, everybody, I just got off the phone with David Wallace, and he has given us the go-ahead to make the first ever Dunder Mifflin television commercial. Huh?",Michael
[applause],Everyone
I can't hear you! [less applause] Heard you a little bit less that time. Must be...,Michael
We had already applauded.,Dwight
"Okay, okay. Who could do music?",Michael
How about Darryl?,Pam
"Actually, I'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano.",Michael
"Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative. Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known. Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.",Jim
"[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Rolando. Oh yes, she's been expecting your call. [knocks on door]",Rolando
Yeah.,Karen
Karen? He's on line one.,Rolando
"Thanks Ro. Hey, we finally connected. How's Scranton?",Karen
I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch. Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else.,Karen
"Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard. So think about it, okay? Okay, bye.",Karen
"Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?",Karen
This is perfect.,Michael
He looks like your twin.,Dwight
"This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off. We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.",Michael
I will know.,Dwight
"But, you will not tell anyone.",Michael
I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky. Yeah.,Dwight
"Well, sometimes. Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl. [knock on the door] Yes? Oh good, good Stanley! First victim, this is what I want you to do. Go out, come back in. We're going to hide. I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?",Michael
I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.,Stanley
"Just go out, and come back in.",Michael
"I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.",Stanley
What?,Michael
"Hey everyone, can I have your attention please? I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.",Michael
[applause],All
"No, no, no, no, no-no, no no. You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing. Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.",Michael
"Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.",Jim
"Okay, smarty pants, then why? Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?",Michael
I think it's because of my sales record.,Stanley
That could not possibly be it.,Michael
"You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office. Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary. The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes. I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.",Michael
How can I get you to stay?,Michael
Money.,Stanley
"Yeah we all want money. But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving.",Michael
Money.,Stanley
"Mo money mo problems, Stanley. You of all people should know that. Let me ask you this, if I were-",Michael
Money.,Stanley
"Pssh, kay.",Michael
"Oscar, did you bring it?",Pam
To be Edwardian. His best work.,Oscar
"Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware.",Pam
"Sure thing Pam, can't wait.",Oscar
"Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club. We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way. Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful. There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed. It's very exclusive.",Pam
"Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.",Oscar
So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?,Jim
Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.,Pam
Oscar?,Jim
Some people.,Pam
[on phone] Hello?,Karen
"Fillipellers, how's it hanging?",Michael
Michael...,Karen
To the left?,Michael
"Listen, I-",Karen
To the right?,Michael
I'm-,Karen
"Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.",Michael
You called me.,Karen
"Yes, listen, um... You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.",Michael
I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him.,Karen
"No, his work family. Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man. You may have Toby.",Michael
Toby's not a salesperson.,Karen
"You can train him. He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst. That- that was a bluff, um... Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours.",Michael
Oooh. Good-bye Michael.,Karen
"Okay, good-bye. Wait! Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please? Your best one? [Karen hangs up]",Michael
"I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.",Pam
"Hi Ben, Michael Scott.",Michael
Hi Michael.,Ben
"I'm going to cut right to the chase here. Do you like magic? Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes. To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.",Michael
Aren't you the guy that hit the woman with your car?,Ben
[giggles],Pam
"[to Pam] Get out. [to Ben] Uh, yeah. I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby.",Michael
"Everyone says Scranton branch is worse than Camden. Didn't everyone from Stanford quit, like immediately?",Ben
"No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?",Michael
Seriously?,Ben
"What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool, fun branch. We're like Animal House.",Michael
Found him!,Dwight
"Jim, we're getting crapped on. Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.",Michael
So what are you going to do?,Jim
"What are we going to do? We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do. Corcroan dropped Staples.",Michael
Did they?,Jim
"Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it. You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale. We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?",Michael
"It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things.",Pam
"That's the problem, that's the problem. We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll. Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving. I- I have no words.",Michael
We just passed the exit for Corcroan.,Jim
What? What? We did?,Michael
"Surprise! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.",Dwight and Michael
Look at his face! Look at his face!,Michael
What are we doing?,Jim
"Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.",Dwight
"What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?",Michael
"Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.",Dwight
"We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing.",Michael
We're going to Utica?,Jim
Uh-huh.,Michael
I'm not going to Utica right now.,Jim
"Yes you are. Oh, buckle up Jim.",Michael
No.,Jim
We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.,Michael
[chanting] Utica! Utica! Utica!,Michael and Dwight
[chanting] Utica! Utica!,Michael and Dwight
In your face,Michael
Yow!,Dwight
I can't believe you guys. I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.,Jim
Are you calling Karen?,Michael
"No, I'm not calling Karen.",Jim
He's lying.,Dwight
"Yep, get it.",Michael
"What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!",Jim
[throws Jim's cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha!,Dwight
Are you kidding me?,Jim
No communication with the outside world Jim.,Dwight
"It had to be done, it had to be done.",Michael
"Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...",Jim
"Oh no, that is too bad. Shoot.",Dwight
Okay.,Jim
"Hey Dwight, he found it.",Michael
You know what? I'm just going to call a cab from here.,Jim
"Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever.",Michael
"Alright. Wait, what are you planning on doing?",Jim
Do you really wanna know?,Michael
"Oh, God. [hangs up phone]",Jim
"Follow me, come here. Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.",Michael
Or real bombs.,Dwight
"No, no, not real bombs.",Michael
"Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.",Dwight
"Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know.",Michael
No.,Jim
"It could be badass. Yeah, it will.",Michael
"No, no absolutely we are not doing this.",Jim
"Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.",Dwight
Are you kidding me? We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?,Jim
Teach her to offer Stanley more money.,Michael
"So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume. And a moustache.",Jim
"So, why did you and Karen break up? Was it the sex?",Michael
What?,Jim
"I can't imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is...",Michael
"Okay, you know what?",Jim
...awesome.,Michael
Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?,Jim
"Okay, I will start. Um, 'A.' [singing] 'A' my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell... Damn it! What do we sell? Um...",Michael
It doesn't matter.,Jim
I'm trying to think of what we could sell.,Michael
Doesn't matter.,Jim
"Ah, la, la, la. What is that? That sound... The air-conditioning leaking or something?",Michael
"That doesn't make sense, couldn't be.",Jim
"What is that? Dwight, are you peeing?",Michael
I'm peeing in this empty can.,Dwight
Oh my God!,Jim
"Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!",Michael
"Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go.",Dwight
"Michael, watch the road!",Jim
"Hey, you're making me spray!",Dwight
I'll kill you man!,Michael
"Michael! Michael, pull over!",Jim
That is just so disgusting!,Michael
"Pull over, pull over!",Jim
I think I cut my penis on the lid!,Dwight
Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?,Oscar
"I know right? I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic.",Toby
"And spend time with George Emerson. That's what I would do. I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right?",Pam
"[joins them at the table] Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit.",Andy
What are you doing?,Oscar
"Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel. Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam.",Andy
"Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club.",Pam
"The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office. Naturally, it's where I need to be. The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety.",Andy
"Fine. I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book. Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading.",Andy
"Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club.",Toby
Why can't I be in the club?,Andy
"I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.",Jim
Believe it.,Dwight
"Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?",Michael
"No, Michael. I'm not leaving the car.",Jim
"Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down. You and I-",Michael
Guy's going by. Shh.,Jim
You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.,Michael
"And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.",Dwight
"No, no, you won't do that. Nope.",Jim
Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.,Dwight
"Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?",Jim
"Okay, Jim.",Dwight
"Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.",Jim
"Let's move! Move, move, move, move!",Dwight
"Shut up, you, shut up! This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.",Jim
"I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. [Kevin dumping change in the snack machine] And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence. And Lucy's torn between these two things. She's torn between passion and convention.",Pam
Damn it!,Kevin
"It just- [Kevin banging and shaking the snack machine] To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh...",Pam
Yes.,Oscar
Damn it! [banging machine],Kevin
Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.,Pam
Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background],Oscar
"Very brave choice also, I thought.",Pam
"And George, his- his youthfulness. His, um, freedom. [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um... What are you microwaving!?",Oscar
Popcorn.,Phyllis
"Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?",Pam
Someone needs to clean it. It smells like popcorn.,Phyllis
"So, Stanley, are you really outta here?",Andy
"Yep, looks that way.",Stanley
"I'm gonna miss you man, you've been like an uncle to me. Like a kind old uncle Remus. I wanna stay in touch.",Andy
[from the walkie-talkie] We are in a stairwell.,Michael
[from the walkie-talkie] We are climbing some stairs.,Dwight
I'm breathing heavily.,Dwight
"Okay, you know what? You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.",Jim
Well...,Dwight
"There's a guy, there's a guy.",Michael
"There's a security guard coming by. Hello, we're warehouse workers. Would you like more proof?",Dwight
"Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.",Michael
I can see the security guard's eyes.,Dwight
"No, no, don't do anything to them.",Jim
I have to do something to his eyes.,Dwight
The eyes are the groin of the head.,Dwight
"Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.",Jim
"We found something far better, their crown jewel. Their industrial copier.",Michael
Isn't that thing huge?,Jim
"It's enormous, but it's got wheels. We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell. Get the car ready, keep the engine running.",Michael
"No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.",Jim
Aha! [crashing],Michael
My hip bone!,Dwight
"We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg! Jim leave us.",Michael
Don't leave us!,Dwight
Save yourself!,Michael
"Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!",Dwight
"Okay! First of all, stop using my name. And second of all-",Jim
"Dwight, you gotta move!",Michael
Damn it guys!,Jim
"Dwight, could you move over a little bit.",Michael
I'm losing control of my bladder.,Dwight
"Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!",Jim
Did you say Karen?,Dwight
"Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.",Michael
"No, I'm not doing that.",Jim
Just say you wanna get back together.,Michael
"No, I'm not doing that!",Jim
"It doesn't have to mean anything. Just, do it for Stanley. Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley. Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.",Michael
Jim?,Karen
Hey Karen.,Jim
"Uh, what are you doing here?",Karen
"First of all, hi.",Jim
What are you doing here?,Karen
"You good? I'm just checking on the other branches. Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...",Jim
Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.,Dwight
Copy that.,Jim
"I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good.",Karen
"Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?",Karen
"Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.",Dwight
I'm taking Stanley.,Karen
Then we will burn Utica to the ground.,Dwight
"[whispers] Dwight. Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them. And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground. [they get up to leave]",Michael
"Jim, hang on a second?",Karen
Yes?,Jim
"So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?",Karen
"Yeah, trying to quit though.",Jim
"If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult.",Karen
"Oh no, I didn't want to see you. Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier. Equal, I'd say it was equal. So, good to see you...",Jim
[huffs],Karen
"I mean, it's just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...",Jim
"Oh, things are going really well? Are they? They are? That's great, that's so great. I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam. Can you tell me more about that? Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.",Karen
"[slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome. I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.",Jim
"Traffic, yeah. Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm.",Karen
I... will... [gives up and walks away],Jim
"We tried and we failed. Stanley, you may go. Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place. Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free. Pam, I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad.",Michael
"Um, wanted: middle aged black man with sass. Big butt, bigger heart. [knock on the door] I can't do this.",Michael
Michael? A word?,Stanley
Of course.,Michael
"I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.",Stanley
Really?,Michael
"I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise. How on Earth did Michael call my bluff? Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things.",Stanley
Hey.,Jim
"I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything. How humiliating. Would it help you to return to another age? A time of refinement, and civility.",Pam
Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?,Jim
[nods head yes],Pam
"Oh-oh, come on!",Andy
"[Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us. Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.",Jim
"Okay, did you get it out of your system.",Oscar
"Yep. No, I mean I really liked it. I thought was uh, a fun read.",Jim
Fun?,Toby
Mm-hmm.,Jim
Really?,Toby
Yeah.,Jim
What was fun about it for you? Was it the death of the twins?,Toby
"No, that wasn't fun.",Jim
Did you even read it?,Toby
Of course I read it.,Jim
How does it end?,Oscar
Who was the main character?,Toby
Angela. Nope. The ashes.,Jim
[mouths 'I'm sorry' to Oscar],Pam
"And let me just add, that as a member of The Finer Things Club, I would bring a strong financial contribution to any discretionary funds that we may have. Finally, here is a recommendation from former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum.",Andy
"Okay, that's enough, uh. Thanks, Andy.",Oscar
Mmmhmm. [leaves],Andy
He's gonna ruin everything.,Toby
"Oh, my God. His letter of recommendation from Rick Santorum is three fifty-dollar bills.",Pam
Wow. Now we can afford hard-cover books.,Oscar
I like it just us three. [very quietly] I don't want it to change.,Toby
"I love The Finer Things Club. My ex-wife used to have a book club, and I would read their book and sometimes listen from the kitchen.",Toby
The Finer Things Club was not sanctioned by the Party Planning Committee. Renegade clubs are dangerous. I squashed the Weight Loss Buddy Support Group. They didn't need to gather. It was just gross.,Angela
"[slurping her from her big cup] I don't know why I'm not in The Finer Arts Club [slurring]. It's bullcrap. [throws her cup on the floor, something splashes on the camera] You clean it up.",Meredith
"[opens envelope Toby has handed him] Dear Andrew Bernard, after carefully examining your application to The Finer Things Club, we are unable to offer you a position at this place and time. We would, however, like to place you on a list in case an opportunity arises when your inclusion can be tolerated. Your position as an ongoing financial patron, however, is yours to cherish. Sincerely, The Finer Things Club. [pauses to consider] Yeees! [to Phyllis] I got waitlisted.",Andy
"I got into Cornell off the Wait List. A lot of people were like, 'Oh, you just got into Cornell because your dad donated a building.' No. Okay. I got into Cornell because I'm smart. I'm smart enough to have a dad who donates buildings to things.",Andy
"Utica is snoozeville, um, Albany are the prepsters, Nashua, no parking, um, Akron is haunted, Camden... is in a basement, Yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in Scranton, we are the cool guys.",Michael
Woo! Shotgun!,Michael
"Well, you're driving, right?",Jim
"Yes, I am, but I want shotgun for you.",Michael
Mmm... I'd prefer to sit in back.,Jim
Wait! I wanted to sit next to you.,Dwight
"No, Dwight! Dwight, Jim is sitting next to me. You're gonna sit in the back left where I don't have to see your ugly moongob.",Michael
"Okay, that is so mean! You know what, I'm not going.",Dwight
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Dwight, you're handsome. You're a very handsome man, get in the car.",Michael
Woohoo!,Dwight
"[on phone] So, there was no sales call.",Pam
"Nnnno. Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire. But I think I fixed it.",Jim
"Wait, you're going along with this now?",Pam
"I have to. Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail. Or die.",Jim
"Right. And, you wouldn't be able to talk to Karen.",Pam
"Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.",Jim
A little bit.,Pam
"Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure.",Jim
Because you love her? [baby voice] Because you love her very much?,Pam
"All right, I'm gonna go now.",Jim
Okay. Have fun with your girlfriend!,Pam
"Okay, I will. [idiot voice]",Jim
"I'm kidding around. We joke about that stuff all the time. I'm not really the jealous type, so, I don't care if Jim sees Karen. I care a little.",Pam
They sprayed me in the eye. [Dwight and Michael are trapped by/under a copier in the stairwell],Security guard
[moans] Scranton rules! [sprays Silly Spray],Dwight
"Dwight! Stop it! [moans] Can you help me please, I'm being crushed.",Michael
"Would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room? Like I begged you to? Pam would have understood. Heck, Pam would have done it.",Michael
Pam is down for anything.,Dwight
You embarrassed me.,Jim
You embarrassed us.,Michael
Yeah. We shoulda brought Andy. I cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing.,Dwight
"I really didn't think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did.",Toby
I love camping. [in a singing voice] Anything can happen.,Meredith
"Oh, it wasn't camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat. [Michael walks in]",Toby
Morning.,Michael
Michael.,Toby
Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a 'get to know you' weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.,Pam
Did you sleep in cabins?,Pam
"Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come.",Toby
Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs],Phyllis
"Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited.",Phyllis
Who went?,Pam
"Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, 'No more s'mores, no more s'mores.' [everyone in room but Michael laughs, Michael exits break room]",Toby
"Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience [Michael knocks on the window behind Toby from outside]",Toby
"[from outside] Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.",Michael
Michael wasn't invited.,Toby
"Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? [Jim makes a face] Not real.",Michael
Got it.,Jim
"So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?",Michael
"Absolutely, yes.",Jim
"When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.",Jim
Really?,Michael
Yeah?,Jim
"Oh, you wanna go today?",Michael
And I am always busy.,Jim
"Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.",Jim
How often can you actually donate blood?,Michael
Is there a limit?,Jim
Your body only has a certain amount.,Michael
"Well, is that it? Or?",Jim
"Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.",Michael
How so?,Jim
"A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands]",Michael
What's that?,Jim
"Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---",Michael
Right.,Jim
"In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.",Michael
Not gonna change.,Jim
"I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.",Michael
I thought we had that looked at.,Jim
I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.,Michael
"When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called 'Survivorman.' And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.",Michael
"OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.",Michael
[winks] I'm on it. [leaves room],Dwight
"OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. [Dwight comes back with set of knives] Hey, what...",Michael
Let's see if any of these will work. [clears the front of Michael's desk],Dwight
"Hey, hey hey! Dwight. [Dwight rolls out an assortment knives]. Dwight.",Michael
"I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, 'Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place.' Well I say, 'It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose.'",Dwight
"Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day.",Michael
Do you want me to ask where you're going?,Pam
No.,Michael
Great.,Pam
Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.,Michael
Oh.,Pam
Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.,Michael
"Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?",Jim
"Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.",Michael
"OK, great.",Jim
"This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.",Michael
Yup.,Jim
"When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.",Michael
That'd be great.,Jim
"Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not.",Dwight
"This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.",Michael
"No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.",Dwight
"Well, yes I would. And I would survive.",Michael
I would make sure that you were dead.,Dwight
Well...,Michael
"First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.",Dwight
You...,Michael
And they would call me the Overkill Killer.,Dwight
You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. [blindfolds eyes with tie] OK.,Michael
What are you doing?,Dwight
"I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing?",Michael
It would be better if you were unconscious.,Dwight
"No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to hit Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it.",Michael
Do you want to do this right or not?,Dwight
"Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?",Michael
"Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday.",Angela
"Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?",Jim
"Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember?",Angela
"I do remember, yeah.",Jim
It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...,Angela
"You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?",Jim
What?,Angela
"There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.",Jim
[flashback to Stanley's birthday] Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.,Michael
"And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.",Jim
"[flashback to Kelly's birthday, hiding in the elevator] Happy Birthday!",Michael
Ahhh!! [drops the papers she was holding],Kelly
"[flashback to Oscar's birthday, hiding in the break room] Happy Birthday!",Michael
Ahhh! [runs into door and Michael laughs],Oscar
"[flashback to Phyllis' birthday, sneaking up on Phyllis' car] Happy Birthday!",Michael
Oh! [Michael laughs],Phyllis
"So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.",Jim
"We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.",Jim
I don't like it. [Angela leaves],Angela
"Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?",Pam
"It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?",Jim
Do you think it's a good idea?,Pam
No... I think it's a great idea.,Jim
[smiles] Hmm.,Pam
We're here. [gets out of the car],Dwight
Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.,Michael
[leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow],Dwight
"Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?",Dwight
"Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.",Dwight
"You know, try sending them another invoice.",Jim
Ok.,Oscar
"Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?",Jim
"[picks up and reads memo] 'Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today.' This is really cool.",Oscar
Right? I was just thinking...,Jim
"No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.",Oscar
Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes],Jim
Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles],Dwight
"What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --",Michael
I'm just --,Dwight
Stop.,Michael
Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael's blindfold off] Behold.,Dwight
"Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.",Michael
Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.,Dwight
"Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. [Dwight gives Michael a hug]",Michael
"Good luck, Michael.",Dwight
"Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight. [Dwight runs off]",Michael
"Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake?",Meredith
What's that?,Jim
I really prefer devils food cake.,Meredith
"Oh, sure.",Jim
Yes!,Meredith
OK. [Meredith leaves],Jim
Wow! That was easy.,Pam
"Yeah, people like me I guess.",Jim
[knocking from outside window in break room] Jim.,Creed
I hate devils food.,Creed
Well I think Meredith was just --,Jim
"Screw Meredith, I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday.",Creed
Everybody's birthday.,Jim
Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake.,Creed
What do you want?,Jim
I want pie. I want peach pie.,Creed
You want a birthday pie?,Jim
I want a nice cobbler.,Creed
"Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.",Jim
I don't care who you talk to. Just make it happen.,Creed
It will be Angela.,Jim
You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means.,Creed
"[to own camcorder] Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. [cuts pants with knife] OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...",Michael
"I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.",Dwight
"There we go. [standing with short sleeves and short pants] Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts [ties jacket around neck].",Michael
I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. [puts pant leg on head like a hat],Michael
"See, this is a beautiful piece of material [rips other pant leg in half] This could be used for all sorts of things.",Michael
Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.,Michael
Tuna. [rolls in chair to Jim's desk],Andy
Andy.,Jim
"Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.",Andy
Not your birthday.,Jim
"Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale.",Andy
"Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.",Jim
"Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up.",Andy
"Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.",Jim
Loud and clear. [rolls in chair back to desk],Andy
Alright. [Andy rolls back],Jim
Pizza rolls.,Andy
"OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here.",Jim
Mushroom caps.,Andy
"I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. [screams] Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter.",Michael
Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch.,Dwight
"Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.",Michael
About two more minutes [cooking bird eggs].,Dwight
"I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. Ohh... It's Creed's birthday. [singing] Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy.",Michael
"What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them?",Meredith
"Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.",Kevin
"I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.",Stanley
Why don't you just have an apple?,Oscar
Why don't you mind your business?,Stanley
"Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care.",Creed
Probably went to his head.,Oscar
Yeah. [Jim enters room],Creed
"Hey, Jim.",Oscar
"Hey guys, what're we talking about?",Jim
Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang.,Creed
"Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy [pats a large tree trunk] may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.",Michael
Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks rifle into safety mode] on.,Dwight
[knocks] Hey Jim.,Toby
Toby.,Jim
"Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea.",Toby
"Oh, thanks man.",Jim
Yeah...,Toby
Is there anything --,Jim
My birthday was two months ago.,Toby
"Oh, OK.",Jim
There was no party.,Toby
What?,Jim
"Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot.",Toby
I remember that.,Jim
"I don't know, I just thought you could include me.",Toby
Seriously?,Jim
I just though you could add me. I don't see the harm in that.,Toby
"Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.",Jim
"OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?",Jim
"No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.",Angela
I'm allergic to mushrooms.,Toby
"That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please? 'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.",Jim
[raises hand] Conference room?,Pam
"Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.",Jim
What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?',Angela
"Oh, I'll take 'em.",Kevin
Well nobody's touching my cobbler.,Creed
"[raises hand] Hey, Michael. I mean Jim.",Phyllis
"Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.",Jim
"Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those [points camera to mushrooms] are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. [puts them in mouth]",Michael
"Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth]",Dwight
Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday [Michael joins in with high note] to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. [Creed blows up candles on pie],Everybody
"Yeah! [everybody clapping] Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something.",Michael
"Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out. [shows off computer screen scenery] I can also make it the sky.",Michael
"Hey, buddy.",Michael
Hey.,Jim
What up?,Michael
Sure glad you're back.,Jim
You are relieved.,Michael
You have no idea.,Jim
So what did I miss?,Michael
"Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.",Jim
Oh.,Michael
"So, terrible idea.",Jim
"Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.",Michael
You did do it?,Jim
"Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.",Michael
"Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.",Jim
That's what I said. That's what she said.,Michael
That's what who said?,Jim
"I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.",Michael
That's what she said.,Jim
"Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.",Michael
Come in!,Michael
"Oh, it's Creed's birthday today. Should we get him an ice-cream cake? Mint chocolate chip?",Pam
"Pam, are you my friend?",Michael
"Oh, no.",Pam
"We have been friends forever, right?",Michael
"Yes, I have been working with you forever.",Pam
"Hypothetically... would you go camping with me, if I were to ask you? And bear in mind that I would never actually ask you to go camping. That Jim is also a friend of mine, and I would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.",Michael
I don't think so.,Pam
"Here's the thing. When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation.",Pam
"Do you understand that Jim is like a brother to me, and I would never do anything inappropriate?",Michael
I do.,Pam
"So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?",Michael
No.,Pam
Thank you for your honesty.,Michael
You're welcome. Open or closed?,Pam
"Split the difference. Hey... mint chocolate chip, please? Is Jim out there?",Michael
No.,Pam
Can you send Dwight in here?,Michael
"Yeah. Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. [Dwight runs in]",Pam
You wanted to see me?,Dwight
"Mmhmm. I had something very personal I would like to discuss. [Dwight closes door, takes off glasses, kneels in front of Michael's desk] Would you go find Jim, and send him in here, please?",Michael
I'm on it.,Dwight
Michael has employed Dwight to track you down.,Pam
How much time do I have?,Jim
"Jim, Michael's office.",Dwight
"Couple minutes, give or take.",Pam
"Now, Jim!",Dwight
"And this... is a Hassenfass. Case-hardened steel. One side, as sharp as you'd ever want something to be. The other side serrated for maximum damage.",Dwight
Okay.,Michael
Look at that. Perfectly balanced. This is a fine precision instrument.,Dwight
"All right, Dexter, just give me the knife.",Michael
Don't you want a sheath for that?,Dwight
"No, just get me a case. [Dwight looks at the camera, lifts his leg onto the desk, removes the sheath from his ankle, and gives it to Michael] All right.",Michael
Anything else? Flint...,Dwight
MmMmm. All I need...,Michael
Parka...,Dwight
"No, Dwight!",Michael
"Tent, rainfly, gorp...",Dwight
"I'm telling you, all I will need are my instincts and my will to survive.",Michael
Mmmnnnnmmm...,Dwight
[holding up knife] What is this called again?,Michael
"So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note]",Oscar
I'll call back.,Michael
You never call back.,Kevin
"Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.",Pam
"[Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that says 'Good Morning'] Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back.",Michael
[laughing],Jan
You can't always work 200 days though.,Michael
"[Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that has a smiley face] Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting. [Jan looks impressed]",Michael
You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.,Ryan
Yep.,Michael
"I can get you a tutor if you need- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note with a waving, smiling Hot Dog saying 'Hiya Buddy']",Ryan
"Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later.",Michael
"Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.",Ryan
"N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude.",Michael
"Take the call, friend.",Ryan
"I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.",Michael
I insist you take your work calls.,Ryan
"Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through? [Pam pushes a button the phone] Hi buddy.",Michael
"I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club.",Jan
"Yeah, I hate that.",Michael
Good.,Jan
"So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.",Michael
And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.,Jan
"Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy.",Michael
"Um, no, I want it up. My hair.",Jan
Well-,Michael
"Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.",Jan
Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.,Michael
Does this work for you?,Jan
Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win.,Michael
"Uh, come on Micheal, that's tacky.",Jan
Million dollars!,Michael
Four million.,Jan
"Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized.",Michael
"No, Michael. Oh, come on.",Jan
Perfect crime.,Michael
"Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment.",Jan
"Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good.",Michael
"Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.",Jan
"I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up.",Michael
"All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.",Jan
"Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?",Michael
A good start. And I think it's busload.,Lester
"Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus. [To Jan] Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.",Michael
Hey Michael.,Ryan
Hey hey.,Michael
I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.,Ryan
Could we talk off the record? As friends?,Ryan
I would love that.,Michael
"Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?",Ryan
Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company.,Michael
Good. That is great to hear.,Ryan
It is.,Michael
"[playing ping-pong] Game, son!",Darryl
"All right, let's run it back.",Jim
The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.,Pam
What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?,Kelly
"Hi, Kelly.",Pam
Guess whose boyfriend it is?,Kelly
I don't wanna guess.,Pam
I'll give you a hint: It's not my boyfriend. I think it's a guy over here [points to Jim].,Kelly
"I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like: Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like: You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.",Kelly
Jim. Can I see you for a second?,Pam
Sure.,Jim
Wow.,Jim
"Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.",Pam
"Oh, I can't beat Darryl.",Jim
Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.,Pam
"What, seriously? What is she saying?",Jim
"[flashback, to Pam] Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.",Kelly
"[flashback, to Pam] Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.",Kelly
"[flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?",Kelly
So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?,Jim
"Sorta, yes.",Pam
Bring me players.,Jim
Okay.,Pam
"Hi everyone, I'm Diane Kelly. I'm the company's chief legal counsel.",Diane Kelly
"Hi. [Michael sees Toby] No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?",Michael
Toby?,Diane
"Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?",Michael
"Michael, I'm your HR Rep. I'm on your side.",Toby
Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves.,Michael
"Michael, just relax, okay?",Jan
"You know, I think they're, uh ready for us now. So..",Diane
Okay. All right.,Michael
"Mr. Scott. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?",Deposition Reporter
Yessh.,Michael
"Mr. Scott, can you describe the circumstances of Ms. Levinson's termination?",Lester
"Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.",Michael
Oh. Very good. Well put.,Lester
People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.,Jan
"Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you.",Pam
About what?,Kevin
He needs help balancing some travel receipts.,Pam
Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.,Kevin
"Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room.",Pam
"[enters conference room and sees ping pong table] Oh, awesome! [Pam puts 'Meeting in Progress' sign on the door]",Kevin
How long have you known the plaintiff?,Lester
"I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief",Michael
How long have you known Ms. Levinson?,Lester
Six years and two months.,Michael
And you were directly under her the entire time?,Lester
That's what she said.,Michael
Excuse me?,Lester
That's what she said.,Michael
Ms. Levinson told you she was your direct superior?,Lester
"Uh, wh-why would she say that?",Michael
Can we just move on to another question?,Jan
"No wait, I don't understand. Who's on record on saying this?",Diane
"With all due respect, I'm in the middle of a line of questioning. Now Mr. Scott, what did you say Ms. Levinson said? Regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position.",Lester
Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.,Michael
"Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?",Jan
"Oh, are you sure?",Lester
"Uh, yes.",Jan
Can you go back to where this digression began?,Lester
[reading off paper] Mr. Schneider: And you were directly under her the entire time? Mr. Scott: That's what she said.,Deposition Reporter
"Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it.",Michael
"[Pam leaving bathroom, Kelly entering, awkward moment, Pam steps aside to let Kelly in] Yeah, that's what I thought.",Kelly
Did Ms. Levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired?,Lester
She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them.,Michael
Can you be more specific? Who are the twins?,Lester
"Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk.",Michael
You don't need to go any further. Her breasts.,Lester
Yes.,Michael
She thought it had something to do with her recent breast enhancement surgery?,Lester
"Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant.",Michael
What about your romantic relationship with Ms. Levinson? Could that have played a part in her termination?,Lester
"Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.",Michael
Interesting. How so?,Lester
"Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here. [makes a gasping sound]",Michael
"Okay, the company has just a few clarifying questions, Mr. Scott, if that's okay with you?",Diane
I will allow it.,Michael
"Um would you mind please just, uh, taking a quick look at, uh, this photograph please. [Diane hands Michael the photo of Jan and Michael in Jamaica]",Diane
Uh...,Michael
"That is you and Ms. Levinson in Jamaica, is that correct?",Diane
Uh-huh.,Michael
"And that photograph was taken more than two months prior to this start of your relationship. Does that sound right? Mr. Scott, the timeline here is actually very important. Please, when did your relationship actually begin?",Diane
"Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define 'begin'. I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago.",Michael
"Wait, excuse me?",Diane
"If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that.",Michael
Could we take a short break?,Lester
"No, uh, are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago and not in February as you previously testified to here?",Diane
Line.,Michael
"I'm sorry, what?",Diane
"He asked for a line, like in a play.",Man
"[reading off paper] 'Mr. Scott, do you realize you just contradicted yourself?' 'I did?' 'Yes you did.' 'Can I go to the bathroom?' 'No.' 'I really have to, I've been drinking lots of water.' 'You went five minutes ago.' 'That wasn't to go to the bathroom, that was to get out of a question.' 'You still have to answer it.' 'First can I go to the bathroom?' 'No.'",Deposition Reporter
Good game Meredith.,Jim
Don't patronize me.,Meredith
All right! What is going on here?,Dwight
"Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?",Jim
"[Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?",Jim
I told you.,Dwight
"All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, J???rg Ro???kopf, and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.",Dwight
"Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition.",Michael
"Thank you, Mr. Scott. That's all we needed to know.",Diane Kelly
"Wait, we'd like to enter to the record a page from Michael Scott's personal journal.",Lester
Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?,Michael
"This is plaintiff's exhibit 107. I quote from an entry dated Janruary 4 of this past year. 'Just got back from Jamaica. Tan almost everywhere. Jan almost everywhere. Hehe. Oh diary, what a week. I had sex with my boss. I don't know if it's going to go anywhere. Jan was very specific that this is not going anywhere, that it was a one time mistake. But we had sex six times so you tell me. I am definitely feeling very eerie.'",Lester
Irie.,Michael
"Irie, sorry. 'More tomorrow. xoxo, Michael.' It would appear, that neither you nor Ms. Levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word. Is that correct?",Lester
We're gonna need to see a copy of that entire journal before we proceed.,Diane Kelly
I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.,Michael
It's basic discovery. We have the right to review it.,Diane Kelly
"OK, let's make ten copies of this diary.",Man
"Um, can you make it eleven?",Toby
"Eleven, sure. And we'll break for lunch, so everyone can have a look.",Man
"[looking for a place to sit, goes to Toby's table] Can I sit here?",Michael
"[nods] ...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what you're going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know, I didn't want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted... [Michael pushes Toby's food tray off the table and walks off]",Toby
How can you give up my diary like that?,Michael
"I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.",Jan
How'd you even find it?,Michael
You keep it under my side of the mattress.,Jan
I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.,Michael
"Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even.",Jan
Fine. I love you.,Michael
I love you too.,Jan
"[looking at a copy of Michael's diary] Mr. Scott, who is this other woman, Ryan? Who you refer to her as 'Just as hot as Jan, but in a different way.'",Diane Kelly
"Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.",Michael
Aren't we trying to determine whether Michael or Jan were engaged in a romantic affair? Not Michael and this Ryan person.,Lester
[laughs out loud] Excuse me.,Toby
"Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.",Michael
"OK Mr. Scott, it's, it's admirable the way you defend a woman who is so obviously ambivalent about her relationship with you.",Diane Kelly
Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that.,Michael
Considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews.,Diane Kelly
"That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot... [Jan glares at Michael] ...of water.",Michael
"Mr. Scott, this is a copy of a particularly negative performance review. Would you mind, uh, reading the date on that please? [slides the performance review towards Michael]",Diane Kelly
March 17th.,Michael
"And that would be a month after your relationship became official, is that correct?",Diane Kelly
Yes.,Michael
"You may read the, uh, highlighted portion out loud if you'd like to.",Diane Kelly
"[reading the performance review] 'I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs.'",Michael
"Mr. Scott, after hearing that wouldn't you say Ms. Levinson's judgment is, at least, very seriously flawed?",Diane Kelly
"[stares at Diane, eyes tearing up]",Michael
Mr. Scott?,Diane Kelly
[walks in the conference room where Jim and Dwight are playing ping-pong] How's it going?,Pam
"Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.",Dwight
"Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...",Jim
"Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?",Pam
I think I'm ready.,Jim
I'll make the call.,Pam
"Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.",Dwight
"...Right. Spin-serve! [serves, and Dwight scores]",Jim
How can you do that to me?,Michael
[looks at Lester],Jan
"You can respond, just remember it's all going into the record.",Lester
"Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.",Jan
"Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.",Michael
"Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition.",Jan
"Starting at paragraph 6. Council: 'Mr. Wallace, regarding Michael Scott, was he a contender to replace Jan Levinson?' David Wallace: 'Yes.'",Lester
See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.,Michael
Council: 'Was he your first choice?' David Wallace: 'Michael Scott is a fine employee who has been with the company for many years.',Lester
"Was he in the top 5 of contenders?' David Wallace: 'What do you want me to say? Come on, he's a nice guy. There were many people that I considered.' Council: 'Was he seriously being considered for the corporate job?' David Wallace: 'No.'",Council
"I have one more question, Mr. Scott. Wouldn't you agree with Ms. Levinson that the company exhibits a pattern of disrespect toward its employees?",Lester
...Absolutely not.,Michael
[watches Jim score in ping-pong against Darryl] Yes! Way to go. [looks at Kelly] See that?,Pam
"Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.",Kelly
"19, serving 4. [serves and scores]",Darryl
"Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! [starts singing] Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!",Kelly
"You know what? I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me!",Pam
What?,Kelly
Let's go. Pick up a paddle.,Pam
OK. Bring it on.,Kelly
I am.,Pam
Think you can handle this?,Kelly
In my sleep.,Pam
"OK. Volley for serve, P. [serves]",Kelly
"O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net] [serves] P.",Pam
"O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net]",Kelly
Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?,Jim
Yes.,Darryl
Michael. I am very sorry.,David
"Oh, hey no biggie. Just...",Michael
"No, no, no, no, no. This was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. I'm very sorry.",David Wallace
"[nods and shakes hands with David Wallace] Hey, David?",Michael
Yeah?,David
I think you're a nice guy too.,Michael
"Thanks, Michael.",David
"Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.",Michael
[Driving with Jan in the car] What do you want to do for dinner?,Michael
How about Chinese?,Jan
Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.,Michael
That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.,Jan
Do you fast food?,Michael
"Fine, fast food's fine.",Jan
"So, where did you learn how to play?",Jim
Cambodia. You?,Creed
"My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?",Jim
"Let's do this thing. [Creed loses the first point, tosses his paddle on the table and starts taking off his shirt. Jim retrieves the ball and looks back to see Creed with his shirt untucked and unbuttoned]",Creed
What are you doing?,Jim
We're not playing strip pong? [Jim shakes his head no] Okay. [Creed picks up paddle],Creed
I totally see that. [looking at spreadsheet],Oscar
"Right. There, first...",Jim
"Yeah, yeah.",Oscar
I think that's the question that you had...,Jim
What are you doing?,Pam
"It's a problem with the client. I think, Jim...",Oscar
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [makes 'talking' gesture with her hand] Jim, come on, we gotta get in there and practice. Okay? I'm not kidding!",Pam
Wow. [heads toward the conference room],Jim
Now. Get good work done. Concentrate.,Pam
All right.,Jim
On your backhand. [Jim opens the conference room door and enters],Pam
Booyah! [laughs],Stanley
[laughing] Thought we were playing for fun.,Phyllis
No one paid me to say 'Booyah.' Now pick up the ball.,Stanley
But it's closer to you.,Phyllis
[kicks ball toward Phyllis] Now it isn't.,Stanley
What are you guys doing?,Jim
"Oh, we're in a meeting.",Phyllis
"Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last? [Stanley mumbles, looking at his watch]",Jim
"[calling in, unseen] I have next meeting!",Angela
I played a lot of pong growing up. I spent a lot of time on cruise ships. I'm also a monster snorkler.,Andy
"Okay, you know what, this table's not regulation.",Andy
Good eye - it's an oval. [Andy compares his arm length to his side of the conference table] You're measuring the table.,Jim
Do you know anything about physics?,Andy
Do you?,Jim
"Just serve. Let's go. [hits one into net] Dammit! These balls are weighted weird, aren't they?",Andy
Yup.,Jim
"Yeah. Get another one. [throws the offending ball at Jim, who takes another from his pocket]",Andy
"Now, wait a minute. You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?",Jim
"I don't know! No, okay, just... serve!",Andy
"I have some, uh, experience. I, um, once had to testify in a traffic accident case.",Michael
Then you're an old hand at this.,Man
"Yes. My testimony was actually very important, um, because the accident was my fault. [To Toby] Tell Meredith I said it another time [Toby nods].",Michael
"Yes, Michael is going to be cross-examined today, which'll be very, very risky for me, nonetheless, not an easy decision to make, but it's a deposition. It's not going to be in front of a judge. And it's four million dollars.",Jan
"Before we continue, I would like to make an opening statement.",Michael
Fine. Please be brief.,Man
"[clears throat and stands] Ladies and gentlemen of... the... table. I would just like to say what a joy it is for me to be here today, but frankly, at my age, it's a joy to be anywhere [no one laughs]. I'm only forty-four, so I'm not old, and I guess that doesn't really play. But the point is, I have a sense of humor. And I implore you all to have a sense of humor as well. Jan, David, my wonderful girlfriend [indicates Jan, then turns to David Wallace], my gorgeous company... Why don't we all just take a big deep breath... and just relax [breathes in deeply, no one responds]. Good. That feels good [sits]. All right. Everybody feel better?",Michael
"Two years ago, when you quote 'kissed and fondled in the Chili's parking lot' [Jan sighs and shakes her head], were you aware of company guidelines specifically discouraging that behavior?",Diane Kelly
"Na, Na-oh, Naa-es.",Michael
"Yeah, I'm sorry, that's not a word.",Diane Kelly
Ye-ohh. Ye-no.,Michael
"Okay. Were you aware that when Jan was with you, she claimed to be visiting clients, or, uh, traveling to see her sister in Scottsdale?",Diane Kelly
Very nice! [Borat voice],Michael
I'm sorry. Excuse me?,Diane Kelly
High five! [Borat voice],Michael
"Sometimes when he gets nervous he, uh, talks like Borat.",Jan
"Okay, Mr. Scott, would you mind, um, speaking in your normal voice for us. Please.",Diane Kelly
[shakes head] Can't stop.,Michael
Okay [nods].,Diane Kelly
Forgot normal talk.,Michael
This is ridiculous.,Stanley
Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?,Phyllis
"Nobody likes to work late, least of all me. [to Jim] Do you have plans tonight?",Michael
"Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.",Jim
"Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad! [on phone] This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it! [hangs up] Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.",Michael
Thank you Michael.,Dwight
"All right, happy Friday. [to Jim] Well I think we dodged a bullet there.",Michael
I think you did.,Jim
"I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?",Michael
"Oh, I-",Jim
You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.,Michael
"Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.",Jim
"Michael, what time should I be arriving?",Dwight
"Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.",Michael
Hey-o!,Andy
Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party? [breaks down crying],Dwight
Hi.,Jan
Hello.,Michael
Hi.,Jim
How are you?,Jan
Come on in. Good to see you.,Michael
Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?,Jan
"Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?",Michael
"Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?",Jim
Yeah.,Michael
I have been getting ready and then driving over here.,Jim
Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.,Michael
Really?,Jim
Except driving.,Michael
We got you this. [gives a bottle of wine],Pam
"Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.",Jan
"Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.",Michael
It's really nice.,Pam
"So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?",Jan
"Tour, let's do the tour first.",Jim
Okay.,Michael
Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?,Jan
Totally your call babe.,Michael
"Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs.",Jan
"Oh, you guys doing a little construction?",Jim
"Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.",Michael
"Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here.",Jan
"Well, thats...",Michael
This is my office.,Jan
"Yep, never been used.",Michael
Not super exciting.,Jan
No.,Michael
And this is my workspace.,Jan
"This is it, check that out, can you smell that? [the room is filled with candles that say 'Serenity by Jan']",Michael
Uh-huh.,Pam
As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here.,Michael
So you have an office and a workspace?,Pam
"I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim's nose] Smell.",Jan
It's fire.,Jim
"Uh-huh, Bonfire.",Jan
Bond.,Michael
Men love this one.,Jan
"James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn. [clicks tongue]",Michael
"When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.",Jan
Just like that.,Jim
Just like that.,Jan
"So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.",Jan
"Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.",Michael
[puts away video camera facing the bed] Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.,Jan
"Well, I-",Michael
Shame on you.,Jan
What a cute bench.,Pam
"Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.",Michael
Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.,Jim
It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this. [Lies down],Michael
"See, he fits perfectly.",Jan
"I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out. [reveals a tiny TV] I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space? [moves TV back a couple inches] Voila, right in the wall.",Michael
Wow.,Jim
"Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.",Michael
What is that chestnut?,Jim
"No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.",Michael
It's pine.,Jan
"Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.",Jim
Really?,Jan
"Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week.",Pam
"If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.",Michael
I bet you are.,Jan
"Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.",Jim
It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said 'Honey keep the trophies.',Jan
"Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.",Michael
"[doorbell] Oh, excuse us just a second.",Jan
I'll get it.,Michael
[Andy and Angela enter] So glad you're finally able to be here.,Jan
"[Michael tries to hug Angela] No, no.",Angela
Okay.,Michael
"Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? [to Pam] I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! [to Jan] These are for you. [hands flowers]",Andy
"Oh, how thoughtful.",Jan
Very nice.,Michael
"Except for one flower, which is for... my flower.",Andy
Aw.,Jan
What am I supposed to do with this?,Angela
How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?,Jan
Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.,Pam
"Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.",Jan
Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4:00?,Pam
"You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight.",Jan
When in Rome.,Michael
"Do you have a preference, upstairs first?",Jan
Whatever you say babe.,Michael
Follow me.,Jan
All right.,Michael
How 'bout a toast. Shall I? Here's to good friends.,Michael
Cheers.,All
Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.,Michael
What was that?,Jim
"So music, should we turn some music?",Jan
Yeah that sounds good.,Michael
Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.,Jan
"You took me by the hand, Made me a man, That one night, You made everything all right, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah.",Hunter's CD
"You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.",Michael
Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.,Jan
Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.,Angela
"[To camera] I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party.",Pam
[playing charades] No it's a... hump. There's a hump.,Andy
Joe Camel!,Jan
"Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital.",Andy
Montana.,Pam
Oh!,Jan
Joe Montana!,Pam
Yes! Yes.,Andy
Why didn't you just say 49ers quarterback?,Pam
"All right, [rhythim clapping] my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.",Michael
"Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?",Jan
"What, no, I'm just making people laugh.",Michae
No.,Jan
"Yes, I was watching Jim's face.",Michael
I was watching Jim.,Jan
And he was laughing.,Michael
No smiling.,Jan
"Look at him, he's laughing.",Michael
Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone],Jim
"You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.",Jim
Oh okay.,Pam
Well you don't need two of you to do that.,Michael
"That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.",Jim
"Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself.",Pam
I don't know because I everything I own is there.,Jim
You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.,Pam
"That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.",Michael
"Michael, you're up.",Andy
"All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-",Michael
"No no no, no names, no names, no rhyming, no soundalikes.",Jan
"All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.",Michael
I don't know.,Angela
Katie Holmes.,Jim
"No, Baah! But he's married to her!",Michael
"Oh, Dawson's Creek.",Jim
"No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.",Michael
No rhyming!,Jan
Not really a rhyme.,Jim
"Another clue, another clue.",Angela
"Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.",Michael
Those aren't helpful.,Angela
Tom Cruise!,Jim
No!,Michael
Time!,Andy
"God, does anybody read the paper?!",Michael
"[Michael offers his coat to Pam, who is shivering] Oh, thank you.",Pam
You're welcome.,Michael
"[eyes Pam] I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here. The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?",Jan
I don't like that story babe.,Michael
"Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!",Jan
"Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.",Michael
"You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.",Jan
"Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me!",Michael
You shouldn't joke about that.,Angela
Is there more wine in the kitchen?,Pam
"I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip.",Jan
"[checking the oven] Uh, not even close.",Jan
So you keep a very tidy house.,Angela
"You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam.",Jan
"No, yeah. What?",Pam
Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.,Jan
"Oh, are you joking?",Pam
"Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.",Jan
"I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.",Pam
I've noticed how you look at him at the office.,Angela
Mmhmm.,Jan
[in the garage] So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand [the chairs are shaped like hands]. So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles.,Michael
Oh no she just put it in front of my face.,Jim
"Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of 'Serenity by Jan' What do you think about that?",Michael
"Thought about it, I'm in.",Andy
"I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?",Jim
I'm sorry. [doorbell rings] What now?,Michael
Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler],Jan
Hello.,Dwight
What are you doing here?,Jan
"We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?",Dwight
[whispering] Awesome.,Pam
What is he doing here?,Jan
"Yes, What are you doing here?",Angela
Dwight is my friend.,Michael
We weren't invited?,Woman
"You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.",Michael
"Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.",Jan
"Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?",Michael
We saw Wicked.,Jan
"When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.",Michael
"I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay? But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a [bleep]ing kid.",Jan
Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? [Jan walks away],Michael
I hate my life.,Jan
So can we come in?,Dwight
Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.,Dwight
[crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table],Jan
"Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?",Dwight
I hate beet salad.,Angela
It's actually really good.,Woman
Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.,Dwight
The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.,Angela
[leans across to Pam whispering] Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food.,Michael
[whispers] Like... like what?,Pam
"I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me. [Jan serves the food] Hey, looks great babe.",Michael
Yeah it does.,Andy
I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover?,Pam
[Michael dips his steak into his wine] Can you not do that? It's disgusting.,Jan
"You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?",Michael
Oops.,Jan
Excuse me for a second. [gets up from the table],Michael
[to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other?,Jim
I was his babysitter.,Woman
And now you guys are dating?,Pam
Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.,Dwight
Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...,Jim
E-mail?,Woman
Nevermind.,Jim
Ok... alright... here we go. [takes down huge painting behind his seat and puts up a neon beer sign] There. [plugs it in] Oooookay.,Michael
That's nice.,Jim
Everybody enjoying their meal?,Michael
Hey babe?,Jan
Yeah?,Michael
How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.,Jan
No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.,Michael
Ok. [gets up and goes over to the stereo and turns on Hunter's CD really loud],Jan
[to the guests] Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.,Michael
At least he's an artist.,Jan
BFD. I'm a screenwriter.,Michael
[shouting] AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!,Jan
NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!,Michael
FOR AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY!,Jan
MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!,Michael
YOU BURN IT. YOU BUY IT!,Jan
OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!,Michael
AND YOU'RE HARDLY MY FIRST!,Jan
"[yells] THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! [Jan gets an evil look on her face and picks up Michael's dundie and throws it into his plasma screen tv] THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe! [Jan goes upstairs crying.]",Michael
I'm gonna get going.,Woman
Fine. Get outta here.,Dwight
It's getting late.,Jim
"You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon.",Michael
[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course,Jim
"Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK.[to police] Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?",Dwight
"Not now Dwight, We got a call about a disturbance?",Officer 1
Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.,Michael
The neighbors said they heard some shouting.,Officer 2
Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.,Michael
You wanna press charges?,Officer 1
Would she get into trouble?,Michael
Yes. She'd be charged.,Officer
I will take the fall. I did it.,Michael
"You know you don't have to press charges, you could just try to be more quiet.",Officer 2
[running out the door)] Michael! [pleading] Michael. What are you doing to him?,Jan
"Sir, do you have any other place you can stay? Maybe with one of your friends here?",Officer 1
[puts his hand on the Officer's shoulder] Michael can come home with me.,Dwight
Jim? Pam?,Michael
Oh... my apartment's on fire,Jim
[whispers] Flooded.,Pam
Flooded.,Jim
You people. [to Michael] Come on. You're sleeping with me.,Dwight
No.,Michael
I'm gonna take you home Michael.,Dwight
Nope.,Michael
Alright. [leads Michael away],Dwight
Bye Babe!,Jan
"[Pam and Jim are sitting in Jim's car in front of Detroit Coney Island Chili Dogs] This is the best burger I've ever had, babe.",Pam
"You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.",Jim
Hmm?,Pam
[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.,Jim
"[Hunter's voice starts singing, Pam joins in] One night...",Pam
"My ideals at a party? Easy. Jim. Pam. Ryan. The Mayor. Barack Obama. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt. Because at the end of the night, Brad or Angelina would have to come and pick him up and I would get to meet them. Shia La Beef because of Disturbia. Umm, all of the children of the world. Val Kilmer. But he probably wouldn't come, too famous. Obviously George Clooney. Umm... And Jan definitely, if there was room.",Michael
"I'll tell you about my ideal dinner party. John Wilkes Booth. Lee Harvey Oswald. Osama Bin Laden. John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer. 'Oh hey guys, welcome to my home. Oh, here comes the waiter with the soup, hope you guys are hungry.' Meanwhile, the waiter suddenly nods at me. [Dwight nods] But I don't acknowledge him. But I know he's an assassin because I trained him. Boom. Two minutes later, five dead psychopaths at my dining room table. All that's left to do is dispose of the bodies and collect the reward. Ugh, it's almost too easy.",Dwight
"A little amuse-bouche, anyone?",Jan
"[to Jim, quietly] Food!",Pam
"Okay, trivia! Does anyone know what that means?",Jan
I believe it means mouth pleaser.,Andy
Oh!,Jan
"It's French. I studied some French during my semester at sea. Or, shall I say a semester at la mer, which is French for 'sea.'",Andy
"Andy, was that coordinated by the Cornell Study Abroad Office?",Angela
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.",Andy
The reason I ask is that Andy went to Cornell.,Angela
"[Michael comes out of the powder room to rejoin the group] Ahh, did you wash your hands, babe?",Jan
"Yes, I did, for you, princess. Even though I only went number one. [quietly to Jim] I didn't really wash my hands. Ohhh, what have we here? This looks delicious. [picks up amuse-bouche tray]",Michael
[quietly] Not with your hands.,Pam
[touching and moving each amuse-bouche] They need to be presented... royally... anyone?,Michael
Mmm. [takes one and eats it],Andy
Good stuff. All right. Let's get down to some wine drinking.,Michael
"Oh, my God, [eating a bar in the hallway] I thought I was gonna pass out. [Jim takes it from her and takes a bite]",Pam
We should probably get back.,Jim
"Mmm-mm. I'm probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost.",Pam
[coming up suddenly] Are you eating?,Jan
It was just a little...,Pam
"I didn't have anything, Jan.",Jim
"Really, Pam. This is a dinner party. [walks away. Pam looks at Jim accusingly]",Jan
"I'm sorry. She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]",Jim
"Michael's dinner party is for couples only, which is why I wasn't initially invited. But that was then. I very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship. [looking around] If that idiot ever gets here.",Dwight
"So, this girl that I basically grew up with becomes Miss West Virginia, and then suddenly, all the boys start paying attention to me. And it was funny because, you know, I never even considered myself beautiful until people started pointing it out to me. You know, 'Jan, wow, you are so much more beautiful than Miss West Virginia.' [laughs] Ah, so that is why I uh... wait, Pam, what was your, what was your question?'",Jan
Where did you grow up?,Pam
It's been a rough couple of weeks.,Michael
"Well, I just got into a little trouble with the neighbors.",Jan
"Little trouble. Yes. Well, Jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.",Michael
"Wow, you did neighborhood watch?",Pam
Yes.,Michael
"I did, and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep.",Jan
"So she's passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog...",Michael
Yeah.,Jan
And the neighbors blamed Jan.,Michael
"Yeah. But, you know, it was my fault.",Jan
"It's like, you know, the dog shouldn't have been outside in the first place. Anyway, it's a tragedy, really, because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds...",Michael
Mm-hmm.,Jan
So...,Michael
Yeah.,Jan
Well.,Michael
It was me!,Jan
What's that?,Jim
"I spray-painted that dog. It was sleek, and shiny, and perfect little haircut, it was parading around like it was God's gift to this God-forsaken town [laughs] and I just couldn't take it anymore, so I went over there and I held down my knee and I just spray-painted it until I was good and done. [claps] It bit me on the arm, [reaches out and taps Jim] I didn't even feel it.",Jan
"What are you doing to him? What... [sees neighbors' dog] is this about that stupid, ugly mutt?",Jan
"She's a Weimaraner, you bitch!",Neighbor
"Please, please. Don't hurt him, okay?",Jan
W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.,Pam
So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.,Jim
Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.,Pam
"Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.",Jim
Nature.,Pam
Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.,Oscar
"I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar.",Andy
"[sitting down, rubbing his feet] I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.",Kevin
Some of us like the walk more than others.,Pam
[off screen] Hurts like hell.,Kevin
[to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog] Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.,Pam
"Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.",Michael
"But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.",Pam
"Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. [makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as Pam slumps down] I really want it.",Pam
[holding up the catalog] Have you ever seen this woman?,Michael
Her?,Pam
Hmm...,Michael
The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?,Pam
"Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.",Michael
Or in a great chair.,Pam
"Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?",Michael
I definitely remember your dinner party.,Pam
I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. [whispers] Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.,Michael
"Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.",Pam
What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.,Michael
"Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. [phone rings]",Michael
"[on phone] Yo, is this his new chair?",Creed
"[on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet.",Pam
[on phone] Daat!,Creed
"When Pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go.",Creed
"I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.",Michael
I left my cell phone in my car.,Andy
Call us when you get there so we know you're OK. [Andy gets up and leaves],Phyllis
"[to Kevin] Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?",Michael
"If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.",Kevin
I thought that you were engaged?,Michael
Nope. Stacy broke up with me.,Kevin
"Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?",Michael
Not anymore.,Kevin
Oh...,Michael
It's a bitter situation.,Kevin
Yeah... ugh. She's... [gets up and leaves] you don't deserve her. Alright.,Michael
"[sitting on Oscar's desk] Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm...",Michael
Michael?,Phyllis
What?,Michael
I have a friend who's single.,Phyllis
Oh.,Michael
"Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.",Phyllis
"Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?",Michael
"Umm, no, she's a professional softball player.",Phyllis
Oooo. Catcher or in field?,Michael
Umm I don't know Michael.,Phyllis
"Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?",Michael
What are you asking?,Phyllis
I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? [silence] It bothers me that you're not answering the question.,Michael
"No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat.",Phyllis
"Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!",Michael
What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.,Michael
"Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes.",Michael
I don't think that this is---,Angela
"Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear 'Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la.' No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.",Michael
[gets up from chair] Write legibly people.,Dwight
"Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.",Andy
Hmm..,Michael
It's like a ten minute walk.,Andy
"No, thirty.",Kevin
"Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. [thinks] OK, yes that would be bad.",Michael
Yes.,Kevin
Yes.,Andy
That would be bad.,Michael
OK.,Andy
Nice.,Kevin
...So help us out.,Andy
"Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't.",Michael
"Michael, please he--",Kevin
"What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.",Michael
We won't let you down.,Andy
"Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen, [Kevin and Andy high five as they leave Michael's office] don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.",Michael
There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card.,Stanley
"Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.",Phyllis
[to Jim] Who are you putting down?,Pam
"Oh, you don't know her.",Jim
Who is it?,Pam
Your mom.,Jim
"Yeah, whatever. [Jim holds up the card] [Pam laughs] Give it to me. Give it to me.",Pam
"Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try. [Michael dials phone number. Phone rings.]",Michael
Wendy's.,Wendy's phone operator
"Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael.",Michael
This isn't Wendy.,Wendy's phone operator
"Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please?",Michael
"Dude, this is a Wendy's restaurant.",Wendy's phone operator
"[under breath] Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?",Michael
You have to come to the restaurant to order food.,Wendy's phone operator
"Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready.",Michael
It's ready now.,Wendy's phone operator
Well put it aside. [hangs up the phone] [Dwight enters] Umm... yeah.,Michael
"OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.",Dwight
Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...,Michael
"I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.",Dwight
"That sounds good. [both smile] Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.",Michael
"[on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.",Dwight
"The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. [reads from notepad] Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.",Dwight
She's dead? [Dwight makes knife slitting noise] She's so young.,Michael
She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.,Dwight
"Oh, God. Oh...",Michael
Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah.,Dwight
"Michael, you didn't even know her.",Jim
Try not to be so hurtful Jim.,Michael
"Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock]",Dwight
"Please, not at a time like this. [sighs]",Michael
"OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.",Pam
Oh really? What's her name? Burger King?,Michael
"No, I mean it. [walks towards Michael] She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. [hands over card to Michael]",Pam
"I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot?",Michael
"I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this.",Pam
"No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again.",Michael
We need to assemble the five families.,Kevin
"[while brushing teeth with an electric toothbrush] No, not the five families.",Michael
We have to.,Kevin
"The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him 'Cool Guy Paul.' W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean.",Kevin
"[still brushing teeth] Sorry, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now.",Michael
[to Andy] I'm calling the meeting anyway.,Kevin
"[to cashier at coffee shop] Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So... behold our bachelorette [cut to a blonde woman in a skirt]. Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady. [woman walks right by and doesn't respond]",Michael
Michael?,Margaret
[turns around to see the woman from his description] Ugh.,Michael
Are you Michael Scott?,Margaret
Is who a Michael what?,Michael
"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm, I'm supposed to be meeting someone named Michael.",Margaret
"Oh, that's not, yeah I'm not... OK...",Michael
Michael? Michael? [reads cup] Large hot chocolate with caramel and a shot of peppermint.,Coffee shop worker
So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What...,Michael
You're asking what I do with the checks that people write to me?,Margaret
Just making conversation.,Michael
"Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?",Michael
I don't know.,Margaret
You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind. [holds up cell phone with a picture of Jan] Look at that.,Michael
She's beautiful.,Margaret
"Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know.",Michael
Michael? Hello? Michael? [Michael hangs up phone],Jan [on phone]
I'm gonna head out.,Margaret
"Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.",Michael
That's incredibly rude.,Margaret
Now you ruined it. [gets up and leaves],Michael
Where's Scott?,Bob Vance
Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.,Andy
Let's just meet back in an hour.,W.B. Jones
"Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.",Andy
[nervously stuttering] I... have... things...,Kevin
"Alright, what do you want?",W.B. Jones
"Well first of all, I'd just like to say [pulls out note cards] what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen.",Andy
You have about ten seconds---,W.B. Jones
We want our parking spaces back!,Kevin
Whose parking spaces?,Paul Faust
W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---,Kevin
Ohh... God...,Bill Cress
I don't have time for this you guys. [to W.B. Jones] Just give 'em back their spaces.,Paul
OK.,W.B. Jones
We good? OK. Could have done this over e-mail.,Paul
"After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... [starts breaking up] It's just nice to win one.",Kevin
"Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me?",Michael
She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.,Pam
"Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God...[walks away back to his office]",Michael
[walks up to reception] Margaret?,Jim
I know.,Pam
You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh],Jim
"Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move.",Pam
"Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.",Jim
"Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too.",Pam
"OK, sure. Let's do it. [Pam laughs]",Jim
"No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged.",Pam
"Have I not proposed to you, yet?",Jim
"Hmm, I don't, know...",Pam
"Oh, well, that's coming. [smiles]",Jim
"Oh, right now?",Pam
"No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.",Jim
"OK, so then, when?",Pam
"Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.",Jim
"Oh, right, yeah.",Pam
"Wait, I'm serious. It's happening.",Jim
Ohh kay.,Pam
"And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.",Jim
I've been warned.,Pam
I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating.,Jim
I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just... [sighs],Michael
You know what you need? Closure.,Dwight
You're right. What do you mean though?,Michael
"There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.",Dwight
Hmm.,Michael
Come on. I'll drive.,Dwight
We did it.,Kevin
[at same time as Kevin] I did it.,Andy
We got our spaces back.,Kevin
Wow. [Stanley laughs and high fives Kevin],Oscar
Nice job.,Pam
Nice. [fist bumps Kevin],Jim
"Yeah, there it is. You're welcome.",Andy
"Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park.",Andy
[looking at the chair model's headstone] How did she die?,Michael
I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.,Dwight
God.,Michael
Yeah.,Dwight
She was so innocent.,Michael
She was stoned apparently.,Dwight
"You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?",Michael
You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.,Dwight
"Oh, you move on.",Michael
Yeah.,Dwight
Where do you want to go for dinner?,Jim
"I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one...",Pam
"Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?",Jim
[smiling] I hate you. [walks away],Pam
"What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.",Jim
"Oh, oh.",Pam
"No, no, no.",Jim
How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?,Pam
"[singing] Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off [with Dwight] and die?",Michael
"[singing] OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then [jumbling up the words] can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. [more jumbled words] 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...",Michael/Dwight
Return.,Michael
Rhythm and blues...,Dwight
This'll be [with Dwight] the day that I died.,Michael
"It is moving day. I have spent the last month here at Dwight's lovely farm, taking a little bit of a vacation, clearing my head after Jan and I, um [Dwight puts his fingers to his head and makes a shooting noise] ssp... No, I did not kill her. We were just at different places in our lives. No, I thought I'd be the bigger man and allow her to stay at the condo. She has since moved on; she is staying with her sister in Scottsdale. Fresh outlook, and it's all good.",Michael
"Okay, so look that over, make sure it's accurate.",Dwight
Oh. What is this?,Michael
"Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount.",Dwight
You were charging me? I'm your friend.,Michael
You occupied the America room for six weeks. That's our most popular room.,Dwight
There was no other guest the entire time I was here.,Michael
Right. Because you were in the America room. In an election year.,Dwight
"Okay. All right, Dwight. Take my money. Go ahead. Keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction. The late nights, the talks, the slumber parties, the crying jags, that was all business, that had nothing to do with friendship, and being friends. Just ring me up. Go ahead [Dwight tears up bill].",Michael
"Thank you, Dwight.",Michael
"We don't take debit cards, anyway.",Dwight
"Dwight, little help with the bags, please.",Michael
"So, what about you, Angela? Do you have any single friends?",Michael
I don't.,Angela
"A cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or...",Michael
A Catholic schoolgirl?,Angela
"No, no, obviously older.",Michael
A nun?,Angela
"Love. Marriage. Baby carriage. Those have been my goals ever since I heard that song. Jan and I had love. We did not have marriage. We did have a baby carriage, which I got her for bringing groceries home, after she got a DUI.",Michael
"Hi, Michael.",Kelly
"[sitting at her desk] Hey, Kelly.",Michael
"Yeah, what are you doing here?",Kelly
Nothing. Just hangin'. Chillin'. No agenda. Would you consider hookin' me up with one of your friends?,Michael
"Oh, all my friends are crazy. My one friend, Brianna...",Kelly
Yeah?,Michael
"Oh, my God...",Kelly
That's hilarious. What's her number?,Michael
She's 23.,Kelly
"Mmm... nah, that's too young.",Michael
"Actually, I know a ton of people that I can set you up with!",Kelly
Oh.,Michael
"Some of my friends' parents, they're getting divorced now. [Michael gets up and starts walking away] So I think some of those, like, older ladies, they're really looking for a guy to go on a date with.",Kelly
"['Rita Klondike 507' is written on an index card] All right, time's up! Pencils down. Please pass your future Mrs. Michael Scotts forward.",Michael
"Forcing your employees to set you up is not a, uh, uh, technical violation of any Dunder Mifflin rule. You know, but neither is forcing them to help you with a shot-by-shot remake of Indiana Jones. Huh-how do you make a rule book like that?",Toby
Pammy?,Michael
I don't have anybody.,Pam
You don't have one single girlfriend?,Michael
No...,Pam
"I'm not looking for a perfect 10 here, just somebody to hang out with. Just fun, healthy young woman.",Michael
Sorry.,Pam
"A kindergarten teacher, who is great with kids, maybe an ex-model, and now she wants to do something with her brain?",Michael
"No, I don't, I...",Pam
How 'bout a professional volleyball player who models on the side?,Michael
I just...,Pam
"You know, just a fun, guh, look, there, here, it doesn't have to be a model. I'm not, don't rule out model, but just in terms of models, there are like twenty different categories. There's face models, hand models, body models [Jim raises hand] - yes.",Michael
I actually know a sex model.,Jim
Really?,Michael
"Yep. Yeah. She's blind, is that a problem?",Jim
"No, I am, it's all about the personality, Jim.",Michael
Okay.,Jim
Are you talking about Beverley?,Pam
Yes.,Jim
Because she's not a sex model. She's a tollbooth operator.,Pam
"Oh, yeah.",Jim
Send me a picture.,Michael
"So far, these are my leads. A blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher. It's a start.",Michael
What's wrong Michael?,Pam
I got gum in my hair.,Michael
You do.,Pam
"This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.",Michael
You've got a ton of dandruff.,Dwight
"OK, let me be.",Michael
How'd you get gum in your hair?,Jim
"I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.",Michael
"But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.",Jim
Kill me... right now.,Michael
We have peanut butter in the kitchen.,Pam
I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.,Michael
"Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.",Jim
"No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.",Pam
"Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we're talking about.",Michael
Smells good.,Michael
Taste good too.,Dwight
Oh don't. That's disgusting.,Michael
Wow! Lot of calories.,Dwight
"Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice.",Michael
"Hey Michael, how was your date last night?",Dwight
[sighs],Michael
"I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude... that, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren't nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness.",Michael
"I am livid, Absolutely livid.",Oscar
It's ridiculous.,Angela
"Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.",Ryan
My favorite branch. How's everybody doing?,Ryan
"Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?",Jim
Love it. Go.,Ryan
"Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.",Jim
"I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.",Ryan
Thanks.,Jim
"David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?",Ryan
Did I? I don't...,Jim
You did. Yeah.,Ryan
Hmm.,Jim
Watch your back Jim. I'm just kidding.,Ryan
"Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or...",Michael
Ok thanks Michael.,Ryan
Yeah.,Michael
I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.,Ryan
Question.,Dwight
Dwight.,Ryan
Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?,Dwight
This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.,Ryan
"I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that.",Stanley
"I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.",Ryan
When will that be?,Stanley
TBD. Phyllis?,Ryan
Did the police solve the problem with the...,Phyllis
"Yes, yes they did, yes they did.",Ryan
"Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.",Ryan
I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.,Dwight
"Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.",Jim
"It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.",Ryan
And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?',Jim
"I don't get the big fuss here, I like the site.",Creed
"If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.",Kelly
Do you have a question Kelly?,Ryan
"Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?",Kelly
"[slow clapping] Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.",Michael
Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.,Michael
You too.,Ryan
"Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. [hugs Ryan]",Michael
Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.,Ryan
Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.,Michael
Na.,Ryan
Na?,Michael
Sorry man.,Ryan
Well you tried.,Michael
"But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.",Ryan
Yeah.,Michael
Unreal.,Ryan
They sound great.,Michael
"Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace.",Ryan
Would you have sex with Meredith?,Michael
What?,Jim
Do you think she'd keep it quiet?,Michael
I'm gonna go to my desk.,Jim
"Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that...",Michael
I know.,Jim
Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan.,Michael
I can't.,Jim
"Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome.",Michael
I'm not single.,Jim
Who you dating?,Michael
Pam.,Jim
That's still going on?,Michael
"Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls.",Michael
Yeah!,Dwight
Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying.,Andy
I'm right here.,Angela
"No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.",Dwight
"Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.",Michael
We get it.,Angela
I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.,Michael
[laughs] With sex!,Dwight
"That's... I, I think that...",Michael
"You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.",Jim
"So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.",Jim
Ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.,Michael
Place is packed.,Michael
Fire hazard.,Dwight
"Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.",Michael
Women look like white slaves.,Dwight
"No, they're just hotties.",Michael
"I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.",Ryan
Hey.,Michael
Michael.,Ryan
Hey!,Michael
What are you doing here?,Ryan
"Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.",Michael
That is so awesome man!,Ryan
Alright!,Michael
And you brought this guy!,Ryan
Yeah.,Michael
Aww!,Ryan
"Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight.",Michael
I know it's you guys.,Ryan
Ok.,Michael
I'm so psyched you're here!,Ryan
Well.,Michael
Woooo!,Ryan
Alright!,Michael
Let's get a drink.,Ryan
Let's do it!,Michael
"Thanks a lot guys, Good job.",Jim
Later.,Kevin
Nice job everybody. Great work.,Jim
Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?,Stanley
"Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.",Jim
"You can't, I locked the office from the inside when we left.",Pam
"Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead.",Stanley
"There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, 'What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?' He said, 'If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks.'",Pam
"Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.",Ryan
"Hey, nice to meet you.",Michael
"Hey, how ya doing?",Troy
"Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character.",Dwight
"Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.",Ryan
"No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.",Dwight
Bottle service ya'll?,Ryan
"Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour.",Michael
We don't serve food here.,Waitress
"Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.",Michael
Do you live in a regular sized house?,Dwight
"Yeah. He's a normal guy, he's cool.",Ryan
You really don't have his phone number?,Jim
"I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?",Pam
I might have it in here.,Toby
Aw! That's great Toby.,Pam
It's so random that I have it.,Toby
"Toby, you're the best.",Pam
"When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.",Toby
"Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...",Jim
No.,Toby
It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.,Jim
"Yes, it's Eddie.",Andy
"It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or...",Jim
"Hank, his name is Hank.",Creed
"No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?",Jim
Elliot.,Phyllis
Elliot!,Oscar
"Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?",Jim
Dwight Schrute man. How's Schrute Farms?,Ryan
Good.,Dwight
This guy owns his own beet farm.,Ryan
Insane.,Troy
Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.,Dwight
"Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?",Ryan
"They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.",Dwight
"Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.",Ryan
You've already been several times.,Dwight
Yeah.,Ryan
Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.,Dwight
"I don't know, maybe.",Ryan
I'll order you some cranberry juice.,Dwight
"With vodka, you're the best.",Ryan
[to troy] Do you have powers?,Dwight
"[on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so... [everyone groans] we did it.",Jim
We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.,Oscar
"Sorry guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's.",Toby
"Yeah, neither did I.",Angela
Jim was supposed to collect it.,Phyllis
Yup...,Jim
"Way to go, man.",Kevin
Now he's never gonna come.,Kelly
"By a show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam? [people raise hands]",Andy
Phyllis.,Pam
"I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting 'Back to the Future.' 'Back' because it's on my back and 'Future' because I'm the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And it's my second favorite movie.",Michael
I've never heard of that movie.,Girl in Club
"Back to the Future? [she shakes head] Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course.",Michael
How old are you?,Girl in Club
Forty... I'm in my forties.,Michael
Wow. That's so cool.,Girl in Club
Nuhh...,Michael
Well I'm gonna go back to my group now.,Girl in Club
"Oh, OK.",Michael
Thanks for the drink.,Girl in Club
You are welcome.,Michael
This place is like sexy pre-school.,Michael
Did you want a place where we could meet older women?,Ryan
I would love a place where we could meet older,Michael
Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. [smashes beer bottle on the floor],Ryan

"Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?",Ryan
"Yeah, maybe. [notices previous girl talking to another guy]",Michael
"It's inevitable, right?",Ryan
Hmm...,Michael
"[on phone] Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up.",Jim
Hello?,Hank

"Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow.",Pam
Why?,Oscar
"I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday. [a few chuckles]",Pam
"More like 'Everyone let's get your boss laid Saturday.' [more laughs] [Toby puts his hand on Pam's knee, everyone stares, Toby removes his hand] I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So, I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home now. [runs out of lobby and climbs the fence and jogs away]",Toby
[Michael and Troy dragging Ryan out of the club] Those girls really wailed on you bad.,Michael
Why wouldn't they let me dance?,Ryan
Well...,Michael
OK I gotta go. Do not take him to a hospital. [runs away],Troy
Pretty weird. [Dwight and tall girl run out of club],Michael
[to Dwight] You have to go with me.,Tall Girl #1
"I do, I have to go.",Dwight
"Stay. Stay, please?",Tall Girl #1

Uh huh. [to Ryan and Michael] I'm not gonna call her.,Dwight
Let's go.,Michael
I don't wanna go back in.,Ryan
"I know, here we go.",Michael
"[notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us.",Jim
Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?,Oscar

Nice.,Dwight
Very nice.,Michael
"One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...",Ryan
I got sofa. I got sofa.,Dwight
"Dwight, I'm the boss.",Michael
I got floor.,Dwight
"Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on.",Michael
"[to Ryan] Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?",Dwight
No. [Dwight starts singing in German],Ryan
"Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone.",Michael
It's a lullaby.,Dwight
"Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off.",Michael
"No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?",Ryan
I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.,Dwight
"Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it.",Michael
"Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?",Ryan
OK. Good night Ryan.,Dwight
Best night ever.,Michael
"Like I said, it's not about the horniness, it's about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don't, I disagree, I say... let's hear it for the boys.",Michael
[drives up to parking lot to notice all the office cars are gone] Son of a bitch.,Hank

"I am so sorry. I'm so sorry, sir.",Dwight
"[helping Ryan out of the taxi] Come on, come on.",Michael
"That'll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man. He threw up in the back of the taxi.",Dwight
Dehydration.,Ryan
"Here we go, let's sit down.",Michael
It's dehydration. He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times.,Dwight
"All right, shhh. Dwight, leave him alone.",Michael
"Hey, don't blame me for what Ryan does. I'm not his dad. I'm his friend, okay? And friends are there to help you have a good time. And sell you the stuff you need to have a good time.",Troy

"Yeah, New York is great.",Ryan
"No, I mean this apartment building, it's fantastic.",Michael
"Oh, this, this is not my apartment. This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",Ryan
"Well, now I can say that I went to a museum.",Michael
"[Phyllis, Pam, Toby, and Oscar are sharing iPod headphones] I don't understand. Which one is that?",Phyllis
That's the other Boleyn girl.,Pam

"Jim, how long? I have to go to the bathroom.",Kevin
"Well, he'll be here really soon, Kev.",Jim
"If you hadn't made us stay, we'd all be home by now.",Angela
Somebody's always got to be a hero.,Stanley
"I'm so cold, I'm gonna faint. If I faint, it's totally your fault, Jim.",Kelly
"Let's be honest, it's not totally my fault. [indicates Pam] Shared responsibility.",Jim
Mmm?,Pam
"Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn't lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it's warmer.",Jim
"I'm supposed to turn the lock when I leave, it's part of my job.",Pam
"Is that... I didn't know that was your... okay, so we're in agreement, this is not ideal... situation.",Jim
Ryan?,Michael
Yeah.,Ryan
Do you ever miss us?,Michael
Not really. New York is...so great.,Ryan
Ryan?,Michael
Yes.,Ryan
Do you remember what color my eyes are?,Michael
Hazel. They're hazel.,Dwight
"Dwight, I asked him.",Michael
"No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.",Ryan
Really?,Michael

Not just because he said it?,Michael
No.,Ryan
Ryan?,Michael
"You're my friend, Michael. OK?",Ryan
"Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on!",Michael
Michael we don't know what you're talking about...,Pam
"Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?",Michael
Michael you could put your initials in it.,Kevin
M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't...,Michael
Yeah that's true.,Jim
"Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!",Michael
We-- we--,Phyllis
Here we go!,Michael
Well--,Phyllis
"Let's, yes?",Michael
When I was a little girl...,Phyllis
"Okay... Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let's hear it!",Michael
We-we found some wet cement in the park...,Phyllis
"It's drying, it's drying...",Michael
In our neighborhood...,Phyllis
"Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!",Michael
What did we write?,Phyllis
Ahh come on!,Michael
"Here it is, you should draw a picture...",Andy
No!,Michael
"Cause that says, that says...",Andy
No!,Michael
So much more than words...,Andy
"No!! Come on, gimme something good!",Michael
"Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...",Kelly
"Pam, translate.",Michael
She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.,Pam
I love it!,Michael
If you were a real star you would put your face in it.,Jim
I love it more!,Michael
Michael that doesn't seem... safe.,Oscar
"I... love it!! Haha, come on!",Michael
Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael],Dwight
"We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.",Jim
"[with petroleum jelly on his face] Hurry, please.",Michael
"Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...",Jim
Can you breathe?,Dwight
Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...,Jim
Hold your breath.,Dwight
And in this case...,Jim
Ready?,Dwight
That's also not true.,Jim
And... go. [Michael sticks his face in the cement] Force it in as deep as you can.,Dwight
[muffled] That's what she said.,Michael
"Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, 'That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole...' I dunno, it's a good feeling.",Michael
"[playing with Madlibs] Okay, adjective...",Andy
"Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice.",Angela
"Good one. Okay, you ready?",Andy
Mmhmm.,Angela
"[reads] The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. 'Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?'",Andy
[laughing] It's a man eating cat food.,Angela
What about a cat eating man food?,Andy
Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.,Dwight
"[wearing glasses] Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up.",Pam
"All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction...",Michael
I don't have my contacts...,Pam
"Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.",Michael
Ener-gize...,Michael
"You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...",Jim
"Don't, don't--",Pam
Would...,Jim
"If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.",Pam
"Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.",Jim
"Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?",Michael
"What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?",Andy
"Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?",Michael
What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?,Jim
"Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...",Michael
An urban thing...,Jim
"An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...",Michael
Not me.,Stanley
"Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.",Michael
No.,Stanley
"Stanley, we're havin a little...",Michael
"Leave me alone, dammit.",Stanley
We're havin a little brainstorm session...,Michael
DID I STUTTER?,Stanley
"...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water.",Michael
Can I talk to you a second?,Toby
"Ugh, what?",Michael
"Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning...",Toby
What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.,Michael
"Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate.",Toby
That? In the conference room?,Michael
Yeah.,Toby
"We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said 'did I stutter,' and I said 'wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?' It was joking, Toby, alright?",Michael
He didn't seem like he was joking.,Toby
"Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another: 'Hey um, you're poor.' 'Well hey, you're mama's dead.' That's what friends do. It's... you're so white.",Michael
"Alright... Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking...",Toby
Mmhmm.,Michael
"Um, why don't you go ask him that?",Toby
"Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but...",Michael
"You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school...",Toby
"Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.",Michael
"You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker.",Andy
[kicks the car] Unh! Scratch.,Dwight
That's a racing stripe.,Andy
"Uh, bumper's sagging.",Dwight
"Mmm, I doubt that very much.",Andy
This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.,Dwight
How next to?,Andy
"Well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.",Dwight
I have to pick one of those?,Andy
Yes.,Dwight
Can you go over those options again?,Andy
"You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.",Dwight
"Well I have the, the blue book value...",Andy
"Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--",Dwight
Can I think about it?,Andy
"Five, four, three, two...",Dwight
Let me think about it--,Andy
Now. Now. Now.,Dwight
Let me think about it--,Andy
Say it. Do it. Now.,Dwight
I'm thinking about it--,Andy
Do it now.,Dwight
Thinking--,Andy
Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.,Dwight
Yeah. All right!,Andy
What.,Stanley
"I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.",Michael
What are you talking about?,Stanley
"Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.",Michael
I am not going to apologize to you.,Stanley
"It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.",Stanley
"Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?",Dwight
Uh huh...,Michael
There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...,Dwight
Great,Michael
"However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.",Dwight
What's the pink?,Michael
Menstrual cycles.,Dwight
"Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?",Michael
You.,Dwight
Other than me.,Michael
"Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.",Dwight
I never said you could do that.,Michael
All you have to do it say it.,Dwight
I...,Michael
Just say it.,Dwight
"Okay, I will think about it.",Michael
"Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.",Dwight
No.,Michael
"So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.",Dwight
"Hey Pam, I really like your glasses.",Kevin
"Oh, thanks.",Pam
All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.,Kevin
"Oh, okay...",Pam
"Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually...",Kevin
I should probably get back to...,Pam
Like librarians.,Kevin
Entering the....,Pam
"Could you just say, 'these are due back Thursday'?",Kevin
"No. [Kevin leaves; Pam takes off her glasses; phone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead. [puts a notepad close to her face and writes message]",Pam
"A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless.",Creed
Mike.,Darryl
Hey.,Michael
"I'm very busy here, man.",Darryl
"Darryl, [clears throat] have you ever been in a gang?",Michael
Why?,Darryl
"It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um...",Michael
"No, no, no...",Darryl
"I know, it's very, very personal...",Michael
"No, um... I have.",Darryl
"I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?",Michael
Both.,Darryl
God.,Michael
"Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...",Darryl
Okay.,Michael
Newsies.,Darryl
"Okay, so dig this: you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you.",Michael
Oh my goodness.,Darryl
"Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?",Michael
"Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.",Darryl
What is that?,Michael
"That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.",Darryl
Really?,Michael
"Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.",Darryl
I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.,Michael
"Well, it's effective.",Darryl
"[to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?",Ryan
Oh boy...,Jim
How do you live with a franchise this bad?,Ryan
"On a wing and a prayer, mostly.",Jim
"Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.",Ryan
A formal warning... [chuckles],Jim
"It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.",Ryan
"[stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.",Jim
"This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.",Ryan
"I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...",Jim
"Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?",Ryan
"I'd say all the goofing around at Pam's desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him... w-with Pam",Toby
"Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?",Pam
"Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...",Jim
Because you're very important?,Pam
Yeah...,Jim
[washing the Xterra] Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!,Dwight
What the hell is this all about? [holds up flier] You're flipping my car for profit.,Andy
It's my car now.,Dwight
I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.,Andy
"Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.",Dwight
"I've got a Madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.",Dwight
"Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.",Michael
What does that mean?,Pam
It's like a mock execution.,Michael
That's not a good idea.,Jim
Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.,Michael
"Well, you can actually fire him.",Toby
"No, okay... I've had enough of you.",Michael
Why are you telling us this?,Oscar
"Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?",Michael
"Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.",Kevin
"I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act. [Stanley enters the room] Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?",Michael
"Stanley Hudson, you are fired.",Michael
Are you serious?,Stanley
"I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.",Michael
You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?,Stanley
Hmm.,Michael
"I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office.",Stanley
"Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.",Michael
So I'm not fired.,Stanley
That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?,Michael
"Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?",Stanley
Okay...,Michael
Do you have any idea how to run an office?,Stanley
Yes.,Michael
Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.,Stanley
That's not-,Michael
"And I think, 'there's no possible way--",Stanley
"All right, all right...",Michael
He can top that.',Stanley
Okay.,Michael
"But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!",Stanley
"Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.",Michael
Who?,Jim
"Everybody, except Stanley.",Michael
Let's go.,Jim
I can't find my glasses.,Pam
"Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.",Jim
"Okay, okay.",Pam
"[chuckling] It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!",Kevin
[starts to cry] I don't understand why you keep picking on me.,Michael
"Oh, for the love of God.",Stanley
"You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand.",Michael
"Fine. Here it is: you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.",Stanley
"Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well.",Michael
"Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?",Stanley
"All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it.",Michael
Fair enough.,Stanley
"I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. [as Rodney Dangerfield] Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, 'I don't respect you!' Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example. [as Jeff Foxworthy] If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck. [as Borat] Respect is niiice. Borat. [as Rodney Dangerfield] What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect!",Michael
"So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?",Michael
Has potential to be your best idea yet. [Michael smiles],Stanley
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. [laughs],Phyllis
"Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.",Michael
"You know, I don't care what he did to me. He's mean to other people, that's what gets me. He's just...",Michael
Who else is he mean to?,Jim
"Everybody. He just, he's always, he's always talking about people behind their backs to me.",Michael
What kind of stuff does Stanley say?,Pam
"Like that people are stupid, and that they're idiots, and that they're sluts.",Michael
Why would he say that?,Kelly
"Because he's mean. He's, he's like a really mean-spirited guy. He talks about how gay Oscar is...",Michael
Mm-hmm.,Jim
"And that Angela's a midget, and that [indicates Jim] your chin is too big.",Michael
Hey.,Jim
"I know, I know. I think it's tiny. I think it's too small if anything. And that your glasses make you look ugly.",Michael
She's never worn these glasses before.,Jim
"Well, he's just mean.",Michael
"Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude. Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.",Pam
"It's complicated, Pam. I mean, the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk.",Michael
"Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him. And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.",Jim
"Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what? Looking can be as bad as touching.",Kelly
Okay.,Michael
"I put Stanley on a pedestal, for a long time. But sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk. I... jerks don't deserve to be on pedestals. Jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are. Big marble... jerk stand.",Michael
"Pam, stand up.",Michael
"Hi everyone. My name is Pam, and I wear glasses.",Pam
"Hi, Pam.",Meredith
Pretty disgusting.,Michael
I like your frames.,Phyllis
"Thanks, Phyllis. Yours, too.",Pam
"Oh, well, I'm already married. Boys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses.",Phyllis
"Ignore her, those glasses are so cool.",Kelly
Really?,Pam
"Yeah, you look like Lisa Loeb or Tina Fey or someone. You should definitely wear them all the time.",Kelly
Huh. Maybe I will.,Pam
Guess who just became the cutest girl in the office.,Kelly
"What's it like without my glasses? Um, well, here, I'll show you. Unfocus your lens. A lot. I'm 20/400. You got it? Okay, I'm gonna spend the rest of the day like this. I can't see any of the things that would bother me on a normal day. I can't see anything disgusting, or ugly, or Michael... it's great.",Pam
Yo!,Ryan
"Hi, can I help you?",Pam
"Haha, nice! I guess I have been a stranger lately.",Ryan
[pointing] Ryan!,Pam
"Hey, Pam, do you want a bagel? [throws it]",Ryan
Yeah.,Pam
"Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God.",Ryan
Okay.,Pam
The only good bagels anywhere.,Ryan
I've heard that. [reaches down to pick up bagel from the floor],Pam
"Same with coffee, and women.",Ryan
Okay.,Pam
"I'm gonna go find Toby. Oh, here's what you do. [takes her bagel] You scoop out the middle, like that, and then you just eat the shell. You know? [pats his belly, points to Pam] Fewer carbs.",Ryan
"Yeah, if I could have seen what he just did, I think I would have gotten angry.",Pam
"A formal warning, seriously?",Jim
"Well, as you know, Dwight has filed a lot of complaints against you over the years.",Toby
And no one cared.,Jim
But now it's being looked at as more of a productivity issue.,Toby
Productivity? My numbers are good.,Jim
"I know, um, but Ryan thinks that, uh, they're not good enough.",Toby
"Wallace likes Jim. So going after him - that's a risky move for me, but in business, you gotta take risks. Sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway, with the top down [pushes button about eight times to get the top down. Finally it comes down and it's all bunched up. As he's fixing it, the car rolls backwards a bit.]",Ryan
"Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited!",Michael
Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.],Oscar
"Yeah, I'm pretty excited too.",Michael
"Today I'm heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place.",Michael
"Hey, are we doing this thing?",Darryl
Yup.,Michael
"Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!",Kelly
Why are you dressed like that?,Michael
[in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?,Darryl
Like you're applying for a loan.,Michael
Maybe he's going to church. Or court.,Dwight
Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way.,Darryl
[to Darryl] I think you look nice.,Pam
[simultaneously] Thank you.,Michael and Darryl
"Okay, here's what we're going to do: I'm going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No... uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don't have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain't going to college.",Michael
What college did you go to Mike?,Darryl
Let's go!,Michael
"Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try.",Jim
[takes golf swing] Whoa!,Phil Maguire
"Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years.",Jim
"Hey Jim, how are you, nice to see you man.",Phil Maguire
"Oh no! No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir. I am... totally and completely kidding! [they both laugh] Andrew Bernard, Cornell '95.",Andy
"Phil Maguire, Dartmouth, '74 [goes to shake Andy's hand]",Phil Maguire
"Oop, got some blisties.",Andy
"Yeah, you do.",Phil Maguire
"Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. [shows blisters on both hands] It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful.",Andy
"Let's make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?",Phil
Great!,Jim
"What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?",Kevin
"I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent.",Kevin
"So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days!",Pam
"[Darryl approaches as students throw basketballs] A little over the top, don't you think?",Michael
"Show them what you brought, Mike.",Darryl
"[holds up single sheet of paper] Um, that's all we brought.",Pam
This is all we need.,Michael
We'll see.,Oscar
"Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business! [all four of them sit in an empty booth with small Dunder Mifflin sign] Hello!",Michael
"Andy, you're up, let's go!",Kevin
"[gushing lotion inside his golf gloves] Giddy up, let's do this.",Andy
"People assume I'm great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my 'knot' on.",Andy
[swings] Dammit!,Andy
"Guys, do we have to stay all day?",Meredith
"I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?",Phyllis
"Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!",Creed
"Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? [Stanley gets up to go] Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - [Stanley leaves] He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.",Dwight
What consequences?,Phyllis
I will tell on you.,Dwight
"There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake!",Pam
Cool.,Justin
"[laughs] Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.",Pam
Hello. Hi. [to Pam] Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.,Michael
"This is Michael, my boss. [she points] Justin.",Pam
"Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, 'only the best and the brightest.'",Michael
He's nice and he seems interested.,Pam
"He's totally wrong, Pam. [to Justin] Hey.",Michael
Hi.,Justin
"How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker. [takes back the info flyer Justin holds] Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.",Michael
Sorry for wasting your time.,Justin
"Oh, no problem. [looks down] And he signed! He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.",Michael
"Yeah, the booth is lame without it.",Darryl
I only brought the one.,Pam
Are you mental?,Michael
"Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, 'Are you sure Michael?' And you said 'Pam! Pam! Pam!' And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, 'Don't worry, it's just allergies.' Do you remember that?",Pam
I... don't.,Michael
Okay. I'll go look for another one. [she leaves],Pam
And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.,Michael
"Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?",Jim
"I can't complain, people love their junk mail.",Phil
Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-,Jim
"You know what Jim? I'm not really looking to change things up right now, I just came out here to get out of the office for a little bit, so why don't we just play, okay?",Phil
"Absolutely, will do.",Jim
So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.,Jim
[teen approaches table] Hello there.,Michael
What is this company?,Kid
"Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company...",Michael
Dunder Mifflin paper.,Oscar
Thanks. [walks away],Kid
"Dammit, Oscar!",Michael
"Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being 'lured' these days. Thank you Dateline!",Michael
"Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom]",Dwight
Extension 128.,Angela
"[over phone] Hiya Pumpkin, it's Creed.",Creed
"Say, we're gonna ditch this bitch. You in?",Creed
No.,Angela
"Are you out? [Angela hangs up] Pumpkin's out, let's go gang! [they all make a run for the door, Dwight re-enters room with only Angela left]",Creed
"My old art room. [finds a sheet of blank paper] Oh, maybe it's still here! [looks for her painting] No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.",Pam
[answers cell] What do you want?,Michael
"Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.",Dwight
"Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?",Michael
So... what else is up? [Michael hangs up] Mich-,Dwight
"Thank you! [Pam hands him blank paper] What, what is this?",Michael
A piece of paper.,Pam
This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.,Michael
Well I think they'll get the spirit of it.,Pam
Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.,Michael
Are you serious?,Pam
Yes. And don't call me Shirley.,Michael
Okay.,Pam
"Oh! [Phil is stuck in the sand trap] Ah, dammit!",Phil
"You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.",Jim
Yeah I'll- I'll get it out. Thank you.,Phil
Yep. [Maguire keeps swinging],Jim

"[Jim's cellphone rings] AH! Come on, Tuna!",Andy
"Hey, can't really talk now, what's up?",Jim
"Just checking in, how's it going?",Pam
"Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see.",Jim
"I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.",Pam
"Oh, I like you.",Jim
Talk to you later?,Pam
"Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?",Jim
"You can try. But I've looked at your prices. Even with free shipping? Doesn't work. It's just- it's not in the stars, Jim. [Phil sinks putt] Six.",Phil
Yeah.,Kevin
"All right, race to the next hole! [he runs off to the cart]",Andy
Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!,Kevin
"Shortcut! Shortcut! [drives cart off course, it flips over] Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!",Andy
"[hums at copier, Angela waiting behind him]",Dwight
"All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.",Michael
"Hey! [walks up to Oscar and Darryl tossing basketballs, grabs Oscar's ball] Game over. [kicks the ball up to the gymnasium ceiling]",Michael
[singsong] Just-in time.,Michael
Hi.,Justin
Just-in case. What's your last name?,Michael
Polznik.,Justin
This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?,Michael
"Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she's hot! And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He's the most... important thing in my life right now.",Michael
I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.,Michael
Hey.,Oscar
Hi.,Justin
"This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will 'do' you. [laughs] No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?",Michael
Excuse me.,Pam
"Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.",Michael
"Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?",Oscar
"So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.",Michael
You didn't want me before. That's what you said.,Justin
"No, I didn't. You misconstrued me.",Michael
You were kind of a jerk to me.,Justin
"I, uh, hmm.",Michael
"And I'm, I'm gonna go now.",Justin
Why don't... hey.,Michael
"[trying to pick up a beer bottle with blistered hands, struggles trying to take a drink as everyone watches.]",Andy

"Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?",Jim
"I'll tell you what. My fiscal year ends in two months, let's talk then. Sound good?",Phil
Absolutely.,Jim
Good playing with you guys.,Maguire
Right on.,Andy
"You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.",Jim
The job fair will be closing in five minutes. Eighth period will commence as scheduled.,Woman on mic
"Hold down the fort, I have to do something. [walks up to microphone] Excuse me. If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force? [Airforce recruiter glares at Michael] Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they, well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin? We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands?

Oooh! [Kevin and Andy add suggestive 'bow-chicka-wow-wow' vocals],Kevin
"Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me.",Michael

Are you interested in graphic design?,Graphics guy
Yeah. Can I fill out an application?,Pam
"Oh absolutely, here, take a seat. I should let you know right away, this is just an entry-level job. It's really basic. We're looking for like, a self starter, someone who can meet deadlines, who just pretty much just go the extra mile, I guess.",Graphics guy
I can do that.,Pam
"Great. And uh, obviously looking for someone who knows Photoshop, and Dreamweaver. Uh, Corel Painter, Illustrator, AfterEffects, all the basics.",Graphics guy
I don't know any of those.,Pam
"[laughs] It's actually not super-complicated. I mean I'm sure there's some sort of like, adult education classes in the area. But if you're really serious about graphic design, one thing about New York or Philadelphia, they've got amazing programs out there for design.",Graphics guy
New York or Philadelphia.,Pam

Paper.,Brad
"That's called card stock. That's what you're feeling. Now what you're feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration... You're thinking, 'Am I good enough for this job? Do I have what it takes?' And I think we both know the answer. We'll find that out together. You can keep that.",Michael
Are you sure?,Brad
"Mmm, yeah.",Michael
Sweet. [camera zooms in on Pam],Brad
"Don't fold it, though.",Michael
"We have the Dundies, my birthday, those blow out, and it's sexy, it's sort of a sexy atmosphere, you know? The other day, in the parking lot, I actually found a condom. So. [to Pam] I've been meaning to ask you, do you know whose that was? [Pam shakes head no] So, sexy is fun...",Michael
"Well, it was nice meeting you, I'm, I'm gonna take off.",Brad

"Okay, be my guest.",Michael

"Yeah, I get it, okay, I'm not interested. Stop following me around; you're really starting to creep me out.",Brad
One other thing I wanted to...,Michael
"Nnn, look. I was just being polite. I don't want to waste my life selling paper for your stupid company, okay? [walks away]",Brad
[laughs] Ohh...Nah.,Michael

[chuckling] Okay.,Justin
Okay.,Michael
Have you given any more thought to Dunder Mifflin?,Michael
"Well, you took away the brochure, so I sort of...",Justin
"Well, yeah, but you don't need the brochure. The brochure is up here [indicates head] and it's in here. [indicates heart]",Michael

"Mornin'. [to camera] So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And... [watch beeps]",Michael
"Good morning, Kelly.",Toby
I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?,Kelly
Fine. Good.,Toby
I feel weird.,Kelly
"First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party.",Michael
We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.,Angela
Okay.,Michael
But so far we only have two pictures of him.,Angela
"Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets...",Michael
"Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral?",Pam
"If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?",Michael
Michael...,Angela
"Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-",Michael
No. You know-no!,Angela
Toga!,Michael
"You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.",Angela
I thought that you might say that. [takes off his shoe; hums; takes out cash from shoe],Michael
"Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. 'Michael, buy a motorcycle.' So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.",Michael
"I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.",Michael
So how much antigravity potion do you want?,Pam
"No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.",Angela
"Phyllis, can you do this?",Michael
[whispers] Yes.,Phyllis
"Hi, can I help you?",Pam
"Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?",Holly
"As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day.",Toby
So this is H.R. This is your desk.,Toby
I love the view.,Holly
"Yeah, it's great, isn't it?",Toby
Hey. [kisses Jim on cheek],Pam
Hey... What?,Jim
Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.,Pam
No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!,Jim
"Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!",Pam
Yes! So when do you start?,Jim
"I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw 'congratulations' and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.",Pam
Wow. Busy morning.,Jim
"So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months...",Pam
"It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.",Jim
"Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great.",Pam
See how easy that is?,Jim
Ohh... [they hug; she laughs],Pam
"I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word 'perfect' in here!",Pam
"Hey, Stanley...",Toby
Hmm?,Stanley
I want to introduce you to...,Toby
[watching from his office] Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow.,Michael
So what do we know about her?,Dwight
"Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.",Michael
I hate her too.,Dwight
Why do you hate her?,Michael
Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.,Dwight
"You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me.",Michael
Would that be such a bad thing?,Dwight
"Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?",Michael
What?,Dwight
We need to sell her an elevator pass.,Michael
"But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa... [gasps]",Dwight
Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.,Michael
Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?,Phyllis
Antigravity machines?,Woman over speakerphone
That's right. Yeah.,Phyllis
What do they do exactly?,Woman over speakerphone
They make you feel lighter...,Phyllis
Antigravity... Um... Anti...depressants? I could put you through to someone on that.,Woman over speakerphone
Okay.,Phyllis
[knock on door] Yeah.,Michael
Hey Michael.,Toby
"Oh, hey, do you still work here?",Michael
I'd like to introduce you to my replacement.,Toby
Nah.,Michael
Come on.,Toby
No. I think I will pass.,Michael
"Michael Scott, this is Holly.",Toby
Hi.,Holly
"Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here: my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert: I'm gonna win.",Michael
"Man, someone doesn't like H.R.",Holly
Yeah.,Michael
[to Toby] What did you do to him?,Holly
Nothing.,Toby
T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.,Michael
"Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.",Holly
Y-You can-Michael.,Michael
"Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet.",Michael
[shaking Holly's hand] The pleasure's all mine.,Creed
"Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.",Holly
Any time.,Creed
What do you do here?,Holly
...Excuse me.,Creed
"What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. 'What do I do?'... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. 'Qua' something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close.",Creed
[whispering] Have you been introduced to Kevin?,Dwight
"No. Which one's Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle]",Holly
"He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.",Dwight
Oh. Good for you guys.,Holly
Yeah.,Dwight
Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.,Dwight
"Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos]",Dwight
Hello. Hello. [to Kevin] Hi.,Holly
Hi.,Kevin
What do you do?,Holly
I do the numbers.,Kevin
"Oh, good for you.",Holly
Do you want a M&M?,Kevin
"Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.",Holly
Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.,Kevin
Well that is a very safe place for them.,Holly
Yeah.,Kevin
"Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?",Michael
"Oh... [laughs along] Nice, I've never heard that one before actually.",Holly
I bet.,Michael
That's good.,Holly
I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?,Michael
"No, no, I...",Holly
"Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?",Michael
"Ooh, uh...",Holly
"You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?",Michael
Um... Y-yeah. Okay.,Holly
All right.,Michael
Thanks.,Holly
Yep.,Michael
Great.,Holly
Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.,Pam
You're-you're not in it.,Toby
Well I was taking the picture.,Pam
"I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica.",Toby
"Sure, do you have a camera here?",Pam
"No, uh... [shouts] Does anyone have a camera here? [no one answers him] No one has a camera here. Uh...",Toby
Okay...,Pam
I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay. [runs out of the office],Toby
"[on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.",Jim
Congratulations!,Ryan
Thanks.,Jim
Don't interrupt.,Ryan
I just-,Jim
Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?,Ryan
"No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...",Jim
"All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.",Ryan
"All right, well it already went through, so...",Jim
Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up],Ryan
Hello?,Jim
[listening to 'Crash Into Me' on his computer] Hmm... Jim? [Jim comes into his office] I am downloading some N3P...,Michael
That's not it.,Jim
Music...,Michael
Yeah.,Jim
For a CD mix tape...,Michael
Close.,Jim
For Holly.,Michael
Mmhmm.,Jim
And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.,Michael
What are the two levels?,Jim
"The two levels being, uh, 'Welcome to Scranton'...",Michael
Mmhmm.,Jim
And 'I... love you.',Michael
Okay. Let's start with the 'I love you' level.,Jim
"Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?",Michael
Yes. You don't love Holly.,Jim
I think I do.,Michael
But you just met her.,Jim
"Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.",Michael
"Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that.",Jim
"Well, you're not a romantic.",Michael
"Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.",Jim
Oh really?,Michael
Yeah.,Jim
"Like, with who?",Michael
We've been through this.,Jim
Pam?,Michael
"Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.",Jim
"Yeah, you took it too slow.",Michael
"Well, we're really happy.",Jim
This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.,Michael
"And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.",Jim
I don't want her to get away.,Michael
"I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.",Jim
I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?,Jim
"Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't...",Phyllis
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.",Jim
Why would you do that?,Phyllis
"Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]",Jim
Really?,Phyllis
"Well we all want a good party, right?",Jim
I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap!,Jim
Hey Kevin.,Holly
Hi.,Kevin
Do you need some help?,Holly
I can't decide what to get.,Kevin
"Well, what do you like to eat?",Holly
"Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.",Kevin
"Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? [looks at the change in his hand] Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row.",Holly
Hmm...,Kevin
"I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.",Kevin
"[on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply]",Jim
[tool clicking] Damn it!,Holly
"Hello, Holly. [Holly is on the floor with her desk chair in pieces] Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.",Michael
"Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights.",Holly
"And the sequel, 'Woman Stands at Desk and Works.' So, I have no idea how you, [he sits on the floor] how you sit like that.",Michael
Yoga.,Holly
[as Yoda] Sit on floor and put together chair we will. [laughs nervously] Yo-da. Um...,Michael
"[as Yoda] Pass curvy metal piece, you will.",Holly
"So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town.",Michael
"Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding!",Holly
Kidding. [overdramatically] Acting!,Michael
[overdramatically] Acting!,Holly
[overdramatically] Acting!,Michael
[laughs] Lovitz.,Holly
Yeah.,Michael
I did it! [exhales],Michael
What'd you do?,Jim
"I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.",Michael
"Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?",Jim
It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.,Michael
"Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.",Jim
"Whew, oh God. [inhales] Laying a base. Laying a base...",Michael
"There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!",Jim
[giddy] Yeah...,Michael
Hello Angela.,Phyllis
"Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.",Angela
Can I get a list of your vendors?,Phyllis
I shredded it.,Angela
Why would you do that?,Phyllis
"Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?",Angela
[knocks files off desk] Sorry.,Phyllis
[Michael and Holly are still working on the chair] What'd you guys do?,Toby
"Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party?",Michael
"Well, we still have to do the exit interview.",Toby
Yes we do.,Michael
"I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin'.",Michael
"[Michael hands him a present] Wow, thanks, Michael, I...",Toby
"Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.",Michael
[enters conference room] Hello.,Holly
"Hey! Hi, good to see you.",Michael
You too.,Holly
I'm just having a little exit interview.,Michael
"Yeah, I know, that's why I'm here.",Holly
"Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?",Michael
"No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job.",Holly
Okay.,Michael
[enters conference room] Did you need me to take notes?,Pam
Hi Pam. Stay.,Toby
Okay.,Pam
"Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed. [takes out note cards] I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are?",Michael
I'm Toby.,Toby
Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right?,Michael
"Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?",Holly
Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.,Michael
Here you go.,Holly
Thank you. [reads] What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?,Michael
"This place, um...",Toby
"Well, no no no no no...",Michael
"I've got some ideas, I guess...",Toby
No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud.,Michael
"Oh, I'd like to hear the answer.",Holly
"Well let me see... I would, uh...",Toby
[hides his face from Holly; whispers to Toby] I'll kill you.,Michael
I guess everything's okay.,Toby
"I made it this far, right? What's the point?",Toby
"Toby, why don't you open your present?",Pam
"Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which...",Michael
[unwraps present; present is a rock with a Post-It note rubber-banded to it; reads] 'Suck on this.',Toby
What the hell is that?,Michael
Michael...,Pam
"That's... What do you mean, 'Michael'? That's not even my handwriting. [exits conference room] Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!",Michael
You did.,Dwight
No!,Michael
You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- [Michael slams conference room door in his face],Dwight
"Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby.",Michael
So what is your gift?,Pam
"My gift is forthcoming, Pam.",Michael
What is it?,Pam
I am going to give Toby...,Michael
Your watch?,Pam
"...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?",Michael
I just knew.,Pam
How did you know?,Michael
Oh that is so sweet.,Holly
Well... That's my watch.,Michael
"Thanks, I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time.",Toby
"Hey, that's good.",Michael
"[from outside the conference room] Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! [Michael, Toby, Holly, and Pam exit the conference room] Hey! It's the temp! Look! [everyone is crowded around Jim's computer]",Creed
Oh my gosh.,Dwight
It's the temp! [all are watching a YouTube video of Ryan being escorted out of Dunder Mifflin corporate offices by policemen],Creed
Is that the police?,Pam
Yes.,Dwight
Mm-hmm.,Creed
"Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as 'misleading the shareholders.' Another good term is 'fraud.' The real crime, I think, was the beard.",Oscar
[still watching video of Ryan] Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God.,Michael
"I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, 'Hi Ryan.' And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, 'Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison.'",Kelly
Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?,Jim
Absolutely. [dials and hands Jim receiver],Pam
"[clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]",Jim
What's protocol on this?,Holly
"I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't- [Holly knocks on Michael's door]",Toby
"Michael, are you okay?",Holly
[voice straining] I'm just worried about my friend.,Michael
"Oh, of course you are.",Holly
"Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run.",Michael
"No, hey.",Holly
I'm cool.,Michael
Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...,Holly
"Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level.",Michael
[everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!,Kevin
"Kevin, take your shoes off first!",Phyllis
"No antigravity machine, huh?",Michael
"Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real.",Phyllis
Ferris wheel's pretty cool though.,Michael
Wow. Look at our parking lot.,Pam
"Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]",Jim
"Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?",Pam
"Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.",Holly
That's what she... a lot of places are like that.,Michael
I think it's really cool you hired Kevin.,Holly
Thanks.,Michael
You have it?,Dwight
Almost. [she unlocks Holly's car],Meredith
"Okay, here we go. Here we go. [Mose carries a raccoon in a cage] Put it in. [he puts the raccoon in the car]",Dwight
"I like, uh...",Michael
That-That's my car.,Holly
Hey. What are you doing?,Michael
[Mose drops cage and runs] Mose!,Dwight
What the hell is going on here?!,Michael
N-nothing you need to know the details of.,Dwight
"There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!",Michael
N-no there's not.,Dwight
Why did you do that?,Michael
It was playful hazing.,Dwight
"No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best. [to Dwight] Take care of that, all right?",Michael
It's not rabid.,Dwight
Shh...,Michael
Thanks for bringing that up.,Meredith
"Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.",Dwight
I'm really sorry.,Michael
"Michael, thank you so much for saying that. [puts a hand on his arm] I feel so welcome here.",Holly
Yeah...,Michael
"I just... Um, excuse me.",Holly
"Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so... sometimes I don't know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh... I like it! [giggles]",Michael
"Hey Mrs. Vance, we're all out!",Vance Refrigeration guy
"Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay.",Phyllis
Cool! You drive your own car?,Holly
Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?,Kevin
Yep. Just like you.,Holly
"Okay, bye.",Kevin
"Bye. Kevin, I'm really proud of you.",Holly
"[on microphone] Alright! Let's hear it for Darryl and his band. [applause] You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?",Michael
"[everyone applauds] Yay, Phyllis!",Pam
"Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? [cheers and applause] But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.",Michael
Song parody writer.,Pam
"I have done things like um, 'Beers in Heaven.'",Michael
Classic.,Jim
"Or, 'Total Eclipse of the Fart.'",Michael
"Not my favorite, but...",Jim
I like that one.,Pam
It's not my favorite...,Jim
I like that one.,Pam
"I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby. [to band] Do you know, um, 'Goodbye Stranger'? Supertramp?",Michael
Yeah. [music starts],Darryl
[sings] It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on.,Michael
"I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.",Pam
"[singing] Goodbye Toby, it's been nice. Hope you find your paradise...",Michael
"Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.",Pam
"[singing, screaming into the mic] Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!",Michael
Not bad.,Holly
"Oh, hey. Thanks.",Michael
Someday I would love to hear 'Beers in Heaven.',Holly
"Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Kevin. [answers] Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.",Michael
"Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.",Kevin
Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back.,Michael
"No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.",Kevin
What is it?,Michael
Just hurry. [hangs up],Kevin
Is he okay?,Holly
Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.,Michael
"Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him.",Holly
"Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right? [Holly freezes; Michael laughs] No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back.",Michael
Well it was good to see you.,Jan
"It was great to see you, Jan.",Kevin
"Yeah, so...",Jan
O-kay. Hello Jan.,Michael
Hello... Michael.,Jan
"Wow, Kevin, really? We're- [to Jan] Sorry. We're in the middle of a party. [to Kevin] Is this why you called me down here?",Michael
"Yeah, Michael, I just uh...",Kevin
I...,Jan
I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.,Kevin
"Oh, okay.",Michael
Yeah.,Kevin
"Thanks, Kevin. Um... [Kevin walks away, revealing Jan's pregnant belly]",Michael
Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you! [Jan laughs] Are you nauseous?,Michael
No.,Jan
"Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?",Michael
"Uh, no.",Jan
Good. Good. Thank God.,Michael
I didn't...,Jan
Cause that's...,Michael
... touch that.,Jan
"Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy...",Michael
Why?,Jan
"Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very...",Michael
"Yeah, it did...",Jan
... proud.,Michael
... happen when...,Jan
Um...,Michael
"... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad.",Jan
You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to?,Michael
"...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you. I did not.",Jan
"Well, okay...",Michael
Yeah.,Jan
"So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so...",Michael
I went to a sperm bank.,Jan
You did?,Michael
Yuh-huh.,Jan
When we were going out?,Michael
"Uh, yeah.",Jan
W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms.,Michael
I know.,Jan
You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?,Michael
"No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.",Jan
IHop.,Michael
IHop.,Jan
"If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.",Jan
"Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.",Jan
I'm glad you told me.,Michael
"Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...",Jan
"Um, I'll... I have to think about it.",Michael
Okay.,Jan
"My whole life, I have known two things: I love sex, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, I think it might be one or the other.",Michael
"Oh look, they're starting. [all watch fireworks display; scattered applause and cheers; Darryl's band plays soft music]",Pam
"[to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.",Angela
[gets engagement ring from his pocket] Hey...,Jim
"[on microphone] Can I have your attention please? [music stops] I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and fireworks going off... My parents are here! Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? [Angela shakes her head 'no'] Okay, then I will come to you, my flower. [knocks over Darryl's keyboard]",Andy
Unh! Damn it!,Darryl
"Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? [shows her a ring]",Andy
...Okay.,Angela
"Into the mic, sweetie.",Andy
"I said, okay.",Angela
She said yes! [light applause] And the crowd goes wild! Woo! [music starts playing; Jim puts his ring back in his pocket and exhales sharply],Andy
"I've been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you don't know when you're gonna meet the right girl and the moment's gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks, and the music, and everything... it was right.",Andy
Can I be your bridesmaid?,Kelly
No.,Angela
Well... it's my own fault.,Dwight
Tuna! [hugs Jim; makes small explosion sound] I'm engaged!,Andy
"I know. That's awesome, man. That's great.",Jim
Mr. Andrew Bernard... it's got a nice ring to it.,Andy
"Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I don't have a picture of the two of us.",Toby

"Yeah, could we...",Toby
"Sure. Meredith, do you mind?",Pam
[hands Meredith his camera] This one right here.,Toby

"One, two three- [takes picture] One, two, three- [takes picture]",Meredith
"I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight...",Pam
Hey there.,Holly
Hey.,Michael
So you missed something really big.,Holly
Yeah?,Michael
"Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants.",Holly
"Oh, wow.",Michael
"I'm not so specific as I can be on my first day, but...",Holy
"Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar. [they chuckle] Oh...",Michael
"So... You know, somehow after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or...",Holly
"Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there.",Michael
Okay.,Holly
I'll go to the diner with you.,Kevin
Oh that would be great.,Holly
"Yeah, we can go eat pie.",Kevin
I love pie.,Holly
Me too.,Kevin
Okay.,Holly
Have a good night.,Michael
Okay. Good night.,Holly
Bye.,Michael
"Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. [Kevin is waiting in the car] I gotta buckle him in.",Holly
Well this is it. I am here to see you off.,Michael
"Thanks... [Hank is standing next to Michael] Really, Michael?",Toby
Sorry. Corporate policy.,Michael
It's not.,Toby
You might take something.,Michael
I don't think he's gonna take anything.,Hank
"Okay, security guard.",Michael
"[watch that Michael gave him beeps] Oh, some kind of... alarm.",Toby
Okay.,Michael
"[on phone, leaving a message] Hi, Jan, it's Michael. I just um, I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your Lamaze class tomorrow. Um, and if there's any details you need to fill me in on, like... what exactly Lamaze is, that would be great. And I... will see you tomorrow morning. [hangs up] I am going to be... kind of a daddy.",Michael
Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out],Phyllis
[sees Phyllis; gasps] Oh my God!,Angela
What? [turns and sees Phyllis; Phyllis gasps and drops the box in her hands],Dwight
This is Jim Halpert...,Toby
Hi.,Jim
And Pam Beesly.,Toby
"Oh, Pam! Toby says such nice things about you.",Holly
[to Toby] Thank you!,Pam
"He didn't mention me, did he?",Jim
"Oh, no, he said you were a really good salesman.",Holly
"Thanks, Toby.",Jim
You're welcome.,Toby
"I've always gotten along well with Toby. Uh, we're friends. But I don't think we'll stay in touch necessarily. I think I'll probably get updates on him from Pam.",Jim
"Oh, I think that makes us neighbors.",Holly
It's a couple streets over.,Meredith
"Oh, maybe you can show me some of the fun hangouts, and where to get my nails done.",Holly
Sure! That sounds fun!,Meredith
Great.,Holly
I hate that bitch. I wanna cut her face. [Dwight walks by and hears],Meredith
"Stop! Don't look at me. On the counter you will find bread, peanut butter, and jelly. Pretend to make yourself a sandwich.",Dwight
Pretend? Or really make one?,Meredith
Really make one.,Dwight
Make your own [bleep]in' sandwich.,Meredith
"Will you please? Make a sandwich. Now, according to my sources, you have an issue with the new H.R. woman. Well, so do I. And so does our secret benefactor. That's too much peanut butter. What I propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and I need your help. If you choose to accept this mission...Wipe the knife off before you stick it in the jelly. Have you ever made a sandwich before? Dammit, Meredith!",Dwight
"[on phone] Well, who can do a party of this size? But you're in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses. Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR! Sorry. So sorry, I shouldn't have sworn, I'm so sorry. Um, thanks for your time. [knock on door] What? Sorry, I shouldn't have said 'what' like that, it was really rude.",Phyllis
Scared me. How's the party planning going?,Jim
"Jim, I am so f[bleep]ed.",Phyllis
"So it's going great, sounds like.",Jim
"I don't know, I'm not used to the stress.",Phyllis
"When I was growing up, my mom said, 'the sky's the limit.' I could do anything. Be a teacher's aide, nurse's assistant, some kind of volunteer. But now, I, I'm not so sure.",Phyllis
"This is a picture I've been carrying around in my wallet for about six years. It's this unspoiled beach in Costa Rica, Playa Grande. Um, I take it out when I get stressed or depressed, and it really calms me down. Never thought I'd get to live here, you know. But it turns out they built these great new condos there, so, this could be me, right around, uh, where the trees used to be.",Toby
Hey.,Toby
Hey.,Jim
Hey.,Pam
Hey.,Toby
Did you just buy that?,Pam
"Yeah, I guess it will be my, uh, thing in Costa Rica, be a nature photographer.",Toby
That's cool.,Jim
"Yeah. Um, you mind if I get a picture?",Toby
Sure!,Jim
"Think you could...[wants to hand the camera to Jim, but Jim is starting to snuggle up with Pam, posing. Toby aims the camera, the flash pops up] Okay. [takes picture] Okay.",Toby
Good one? [Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That's a cool camera.,Jim
"Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn't working. Do you guys know anything about it?",Jim
"The website is hiding, forming alliances with other sites, preparing an attack for which we will have no defense.",Dwight
Do you honestly believe that?,Jim
"Yes, I do.",Dwight
I'm gonna get a second opinion.,Jim
"It was down for a couple hours yesterday, then back up, and now I've heard from a very reliable source that it is once again out of commission. And that reliable source is you.",Andy
"Okay, you could just say you don't know what's going on.",Jim
"Um, I do, 'cause I just told you.",Andy
"Is Ryan gonna fire me? I don't know. I know that I've done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and... am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago? Because in the three years that he's been here, I think all he's ever done is start a fire and grow a beard. And it's not even a good beard.",Jim
"Troy Undercook, for Michael.",Troy
"Ahh! I'm sorry, I didn't, I didn't see you come in.",Pam
Troy! What are you doing here?,Dwight
"Just filling in for Ryan, as a favor.",Troy
Where is Ryan?,Dwight
He had an urgent matter in New York.,Troy
Welcome to our land.,Dwight
Dwight. [to Troy] Michael will be out in a second.,Pam
Can I get you a tankard of mead?,Dwight
"Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor? Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages? That'd be great.",Jim
"If I see him, I'll tell him.",Troy
Why wouldn't you see him? You work for him.,Jim
I report to Wallace now.,Troy
"Okay, what's going on?",Jim
Looks serious.,Dwight
What's a...,Someone
"Oh, my God.",Michael
"Troy, do you know anything about this?",Dwight
Maybe I do.,Troy
Maybe I do. Enough of your magical riddles!,Dwight
"And if the food stations are here and here... no! Here and here. Drinks here, then people can mingle. But then where would the band go?",Phyllis
"Mmm. Well, what about there?",Bob Vance
"Mmm, no Bob, I don't know.",Phyllis
"It's times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now. She'd show me what to do. That's stupid; she's not here. [looks at watch] She's at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes.",Phyllis
Why don't we eat more corn dogs? They're delicious.,Stanley
"Totally, they're the best.",Oscar
"Corn dogs should be the standard. Corn dogs should be called hot dogs, and hot dogs should be called bad dogs.",Stanley
Why don't we make corn burgers?,Oscar
[chuckling] What a messed up world.,Stanley
"Seriously, do you like my idea? Corn burgers.",Oscar
I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster.,Angela
"But I don't think it's a disaster. I think it's fun, and I like the food.",Andy
Deep fried Twinkies? It's gross!,Angela
Is that what that is?,Andy
Yes.,Angela
"You know what, I didn't try those. [reaches for one] I could try this. Augh! Fried Twinkies, you kidding me? Starting to wonder about the food in this place [takes a bite]. Oh, God! That is so good.",Andy
"When I had my colitis, Toby was very helpful. He gave me seven weeks off. When I had my acid reflux, Toby was not as helpful. So I'm mixed on Toby.",Stanley
"Toby Flenderson, come on up here.",Michael
"Uh, no, that's okay.",Toby
"Come on, no, no, no.",Michael
"Toby! Come on, Toby!",Co-workers
Toby!,Michael
Toby! Toby! Toby!,Co-workers
"Okay, okay, I'm going.",Toby
"Toby has written a fantastic speech for you, he spent a year on it. It's very funny and charming and heartwarming. And it rhymes, and if it's not any good, he has instructed us all to storm the stage and beat him to a bloody pulp. [laughs] No! So, take it away, Toby! Whoo!",Michael
"Well, uh, okay. Um. It's really great to be here tonight, with the Ferris wheel, the band, and the low sunlight. I'm gonna miss you all when I go to Costa Rica, and if I keep drinking beer like this, I'm gonna have to take a leak-a. [laughter from audience, Michael looks at camera unhappily] Look, on a more personal note, I just want to say thanks, you know, no matter what was going on in my life, you know, my divorce, or the custody battle, or that thing with my sister, it was just nice knowing I had a, a supportive place to come to where...",Toby
"Ach, [to Darryl quietly] okay, okay, play the cutoff music.",Michael
No.,Darryl
"I'm gonna really miss going to beers with you guys every Tuesday night [Pam holds up soda in salute, Meredith yells 'yeah!', Michael looks at camera] and lastly, I'd love to urge you to keep up with my fight to have the building checked for radon gas. You know, it's a, it's a real serious matter, and every time I try to have the, uh...",Toby
"Blah, blah, blah, blah...",Michael
...building looked into...,Toby
"...blah, blah, overstaying your welcome! Let's keep it moving! Let's keep it moving! Toby, everybody!",Michael
"I gave Toby my buddy Jorge's number in Costa. He'll hook Toby up with everything: cable TV, women, oh, and this amazing coffee to snort.",Creed
"All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up. [cheering]",Michael
"From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.",Dwight
"This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.",Michael
What should we do with all these leftovers?,Meredith
I'm taking the dumplings for my wife.,Stanley
"No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.",Dwight
I can bring these to my shelter.,Creed
I'm taking my dumplings.,Stanley
[sprays food with bug poison] There. Take those home to your wife.,Dwight
"Dwight, Dwight!",Michael
"Michael, it's time.",Dwight
"Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.",Dwight
Don't go breaking my scale.,Darryl
"I'm excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked.",Andy
Ex-squeeze me.,Holly
"No, I will ex-squeeze you.",Michael
OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays.,Michael
Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.,Dwight
"[smiles, looks to Michael] Really, nothing?",Jim
"2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control.",Darryl
Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.,Dwight
"Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.",Michael
Family only.,Dwight
"All right, got it. 2,210 pounds.",Darryl
"Pam, you weigh 226 pounds?",Kevin
"Almost, Kevin.",Holly
"Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...",Pam
Math is hard.,Holly
Yeah.,Kevin
"Just, we'll just keep going.",Pam
I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today.,Andy
All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.,Oscar
Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday.,Andy
"OK. [holds elevator] Stanley, come on.",Oscar
"Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close]",Stanley
"I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.",Stanley
And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head. [Michael and Holly face each other in yoga pose],Holly
Jimbo.,Michael
"Ah, they moved the shower.",Jim
Did you see Holly's butt?,Michael
"No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why?",Jim
Why?,Michael
"Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.",Jim
I know.,Michael
But what have you learned about her?,Jim
I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read 'Lonesome Dove' three times.,Michael
Nice.,Jim
And that her butt refuses to quit!,Michael
"Well, I tried. [Michael laughs]",Jim
[follows Jim into bathroom] You have to agree with me. [follows Jim back out] That's insane.,Michael
I'll just go later.,Jim
I thought you had to pee.,Michael
[forces candy out of vending machine and forces fruit into racks],Dwight
"Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.",Oscar
"Oh, thanks. I should check that out.",Holly
Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.,Oscar
"Actually, I'm a lesbian.",Holly
I'm gay!,Oscar
I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke.,Holly
What's the joke?,Oscar
There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.,Holly
"Oh, you think it's a choice?",Oscar
"Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just--",Holly
"I'm messing with you, Holly.",Oscar
"I knew that. OK, bye.",Holly
OK.,Oscar
So you have the directions.,Jim
Yes.,Pam
You have a toothbrush.,Jim
Yes.,Pam
You have a cell phone charger.,Jim

Fax this for me.,Dwight
"Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.",Jim
"It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.",Dwight
"Ang. Ela. [sings] Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay--",Andy
What?,Angela
"Hey, check it out. [hands her brochure] This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper.",Andy
Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.,Andy
No. No.,Angela
This is where my parents decided not to get divorced.,Andy
I don't care.,Angela
"OK. How do you feel about Maine? [Angela picks up phone and dials] I'm on it. I'll see you later, love. [Dwight's pager vibrates, he and Angela walk out]",Andy
"[exiting warehouse storage room] Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.",Dwight
"Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.",Angela
Monkey. [kisses her],Dwight
"No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!",Angela
"[sees Pam and Jim through office window, runs out the office] Hey, hey! [falls down stairs, gets up, falls down again] Pam, Pam! Hey!",Michael
What happened?,Jim
[frazzled and out of breath] I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?,Michael
I should really get going.,Pam
"No. OK. Um, the last word is 'seagulls.'",Michael
I'm sure it was really lovely.,Pam
I took a lot from other poems.,Michael
Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam],Jim
"OK, bye.",Pam
Bye.,Jim
"All right, call-- [leans in to kiss Pam]",Michael
"No, Michael.",Pam
"Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...",Jim
"OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.",Michael
"It doesn't matter, Michael.",Angela
"Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go.",Michael
"Oh, fancy meeting you here.",Holly
All right.,Michael
"OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.",Darryl
All right!,Michael
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.",Jim
"[rapping] I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!",Michael
Wikka wikka wikka what?,Holly
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Ronnie.",Ronnie
"I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.",Jim
"Sorry I'm late. I accidentally switched my alarm clock setting to Zapf Chancery. [laughter] Which is my terrible segue into our course, Expressive Typography in New Media.",Professor
I'm in the wrong class...,Pam
Some of you may remember from last semester I am Professor Monaghan. [sees Pam leaving] And looks like I'm boring someone already.,Professor
"Oh, no. I just--",Pam
Please sit down.,Professor
You're shaking. Are you all right?,Holly
Just leave me alone!,Kelly

I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.,Jan
Hi Jan.,Kevin
Hi.,Jan
How's the candle game?,Kevin

"Cool. Thank God they found her, too.",Kevin
"Oh, they found her?",Jan
"Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't. [to Jan] Come on. Let's go in.",Michael
"When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.",Jim
"Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet?",Holly
That's his ex.,Jan
"Oh, she's very beautiful.",Holly
"Yes, she is. And clinically insane.",Oscar
"So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number.",Holly
OK.,Oscar
"Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it.",Angela
No! You do not talk to him like that!,Holly
But he's an idiot!,Angela
Hey!,Kevin
He is not an idiot!,Holly
"Thank you, Holly.",Kevin
He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here.,Holly
"Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?",Kevin
"Well, no. Dwight...",Holly
"Oh, Holly, that is very offensive.",Angela
I'm sorry.,Holly
"Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding locales: Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disney's Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C.",Andy
Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No.,Angela

Let's do this thing.,Dwight

[on computer screen] I can see you!,Pam
All right!,Jim
This is so cool.,Pam
"So what is going on, girl in the computer?",Jim
Lunch with a girl from my hall.,Pam

"OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.",Dwight
"No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello. [picks up computer] Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!",Michael
Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous?,Pam
"Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.",Michael
The nerve.,Pam
"Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?",Michael
They're on the supply shelf.,Pam
Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.,Michael
"New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?",Pam

"Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past]",Dwight
Here we go. Everybody on.,Michael
"All right, we're set.",Dwight
Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.,Darryl
I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.,Kelly
"I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.",Stanley
"Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite.",Phyllis
"Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.",Phyllis
How's it going?,Michael
It's going well.,Phyllis
Good.,Michael
"I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?",Holly
Cake? Who suggested cake? [Angela points to Phyllis],Michael
We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.,Phyllis
"Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.",Michael
What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having sex. And then again for seven years.,Michael
Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?,Michael
Shotgun weddings.,Dwight
That's not what that is.,Jim
Fright. Being scared to death.,Creed
No.,Michael
Obesity-caused illnesses.,Holly
Obesity-caused illnesses.,Dwight
"Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?",Michael
I would like to lose 65 pounds.,Jim
"Yes, all right. Who else? [to Angela] Can I put you down for 10 pounds?",Michael
No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.,Angela
"If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?",Michael
Cryogenics. Beer me five.,Jim
This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.,Michael
"All right, I'm taking off.",Jim
Booty call.,Michael
"Nope, just going to see Pam.",Jim
Here.,Michael
Maybe put up some shelves.,Jim
"Wait a second. [removes condom from wallet, throws it to Jim] I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.",Michael
"OK, thank you for ... this.",Jim
You want more?,Michael
No.,Jim
I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things.,Andy
It's not my problem. [dials phone],Angela
Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call.,Andy
"That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away]",Angela
"Sweetheart. [Angela turns around] Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together.",Andy
[Angela kisses him] Hey-oh!,Andy
"I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.]",Angela
[knocks on door] Hi.,Jim
Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. 'Cause-- [looks toward camera],Pam
"Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out. [closes door]",Jim
[music playing] It's a pretty lame party.,Michael
Does anyone want to dance?,Ronnie
[watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.,Jim
"Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.",Phyllis
I don't like cake anymore,Stanley
"Why not, dawg?",Andy
Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.,Stanley
"Michael, we have a situation.",Dwight
They should not be in that room.,Dwight
That's so lame they didn't invite us.,Holly
You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.,Michael
Yeah!,Dwight
Let's go mini-golfing.,Michael
"Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.",Holly
Uh...,Michael
"It'll probably be a total disaster, but...",Holly
"Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.",Michael
Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.,Dwight
You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early?,Michael
Really?,Holly
Yeah.,Michael
"Oh, that's sweet. Wish me luck.",Holly
Good luck.,Michael
"Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.",Michael
Party's over. You are so busted!,Dwight
"OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?",Michael
"You said fruit, Michael.",Phyllis
And what is that?,Michael
Cake.,Phyllis
"You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.",Michael
"Happy Birthday, Stanley! [kicks cake onto Michael]",Dwight
"It's kind of a good news, bad news situation. The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days. So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off.",Holly
[spreading peanut butter on a bagel] What?,Kevin
Oh nothing.,Creed
It's just some of us are taking this really seriously.,Kelly
I swallowed a tapeworm last night. It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat. And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it. Creed sold it to me. It's from Mexico.,Kelly
That wasn't a tapeworm.,Creed
"[walks in the office] How's my favorite branch doing? [no one talks, everyone stares at Ryan] All right [sits at reception].",Ryan
"Ronnie was bleh. Things were at an all time sad here. But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town. And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard. Give him to me. I want him. I need him.",Michael
And you got a goatee!,Ryan
I did!,Michael
Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?,Ryan
Yes. Gooooo-tee!,Michael
Firrrrre-duh guy! [high fives Ryan],Kevin
Hey Kevin... [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That's really funny.,Ryan
Yeah.,Kevin
It's great to see you Kev.,Ryan
You too.,Kevin
"I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me. So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry. Kevin just made the list.",Ryan
Jim. I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year. I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history. I've even started volunteering. Giving back to the community.,Ryan
Well that's great. [shakes Ryan's hand] You're talking about your court ordered community service?,Jim
I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.,Ryan
"But he did, right?",Jim
All right.,Ryan
All right.,Jim
[glares into the camera and writes Jim's name on his list],Ryan
Well you lost zero pounds. [everyone grumbles] No change. On the bright side you gained zero pounds.,Darryl
"Hey, you know what? I can't do this by myself people! Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out. [flails his arms]",Michael
"Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon! Who is slacking?",Andy
"Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok?",Holly
NO! I want names!,Andy
This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life. I haven't had a very hard life.,Andy
So how was your date?,Oscar
"Eight point five. I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt. But he's cute, right?",Holly
[groans painfully],Michael
What's wrong?,Holly
[struggling to speak] Mmm--- mmm... Um...,Michael
Close the door. This is your fault.,Michael
Nope.,Jim
Your stupid friend zone.,Michael
Mmm.,Jim
"I should have been lovers with her first and then friends. That was terrible advice. Terrible advice! You know my seduction method. I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh--- You sabotaged me. You sabotaged me, man!",Michael
Attention! Attention! We only have a few weeks left. [looking at Phyllis] And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.,Dwight
"How much weight have you lost, Dwight?",Jim
"I am hardly the problem, Jim.",Dwight
"No, you're definitely the problem.",Jim
"This is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction. Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin. And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.",Dwight
Kelly.,Ryan
"Oh, hello Ryan. You look well.",Kelly
"I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years. I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff. I think I never fully processed 9/11. Um, I want you to know I've changed.",Ryan
Cool.,Kelly
We should get a drink later. Catch up. Pick me up around eight?,Ryan
"Oh that is so sweet. Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so...",Kelly
"That--- I, um... cool. Well maybe I'll see you around.",Ryan
It's a small office.,Kelly
Yeah.,Ryan
Hello Phyllis. Do you have a minute? Listen. I'm really sorry... about what I said before. Ok? I was way out of line.,Dwight
Yes you were.,Phyllis
"But you know what, I want to make it up to you. There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job. Interested?",Dwight
Split the commission?,Phyllis
[sighs] Sixty - forty. Hm? [they shake hands] I'll drive.,Dwight
"[exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan]",Ryan
Dieting's only half of it.,Holly
Mmm-hmm. Saunas.,Michael
And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.,Holly
"Gah, the dreadmill. [both laugh]",Michael
"Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually. But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.",Jim
"Oh, my God. Ok. Everybody just act normal. Don't say anything.",Friend
What?,Pam
My ex-girlfriend. She's right behind you. Just... hide me.,Friend
"Really, where?",Pam
No no! Don't look! [Pam sees an old lady behind him],Friend
"Wow, was it the age difference?",Pam
"Uh, actually, kind of. Yes. I just didn't like eating dinner that early. [they laugh, Pam's phone rings, she answers]",Friend
"Hey! Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit? I made friends!",Pam
"[storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?!",Phyllis
"Hey, hey!",Dwight
"Oh my God, what happened?",Oscar
There was no client. Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car. I had to walk home with no money and no phone.,Phyllis
"And you burned over a thousand calories walking home. And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest. Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! [claps]",Dwight
You left me in a bad part of town!,Phyllis
"Yeah, I took your purse. What are you worried about? [Phyllis storms to her desk, picks up phone and dials] You look great. I can definitely see the difference.",Dwight
[into phone] Phyllis Vance for David Wallace.,Phyllis
...or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate. Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies. As was clearly stated in the official starting---',Holly
"[in a fat suit, speaking in his Michael Clump voice] Ohhhh! Bang! Boom! Say Clump! Why hello everybody!",Michael
What are you doing?,Holly
Fair question.,Jim
"I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful. [hangs pictures of fat people on the wall, including two fat people on a bike, the Ghostbusters Marshmallow Man, Elvis, Martin Lawrence in Big Mamma's House, Jabba the Hutt, and a fat pig] They are beautiful. He is beautiful. This big fat pig is beautiful.",Michael
It's my sumo suit. I just didn't inflate it all the way. I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.,Michael
Body image. We are here because there is something wrong with society.,Michael
"See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.",Jim
"If it's me, then society made me that way. Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, 'Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?'",Michael
Because you're kind of doing Michael Clump.,Kevin
How do you know Michael Clump?,Michael
Because it's your making-fun-of-fat-people character.,Oscar
How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.,Michael
"I think of him as more like... a monster? What about, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'",Oscar
"No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'",Dwight
"No, no, no, NO, no! You know what? Fat people are not monsters! Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject. Bang! Boom! Case in point! Look at the outside of this building. It is ugly. But you come inside... and it is beautiful. Just like this unappealing fat suit. Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.",Michael
Vamping.,Dwight
"Hey! Why don't you just sit down, please?",Michael
"Eh, I've been sitting all day.",Dwight
We're doing this because of you. So why don't you just go stand somewhere else. [to Ryan] Hey. Hey. You shaved?,Michael
I did.,Ryan
Why?,Michael
[at a loss for words],Ryan
"So, in the year 2000, fungus and even black mold was discovered growing in the cave. Some blame it on the new air conditioning system they installed. Some, on the high powered lights. [Pam's friend shows Pam a drawing mocking the professor, they laugh] Others feel that fungus is do to an over---",Professor
[to friend] Nice.,Pam
Quiet please.,Professor
Sorry.,Pam
Sorry.,Friend
"Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.",Michael
She should thank me.,Dwight
"Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first.",Michael
Why should I have to thank him?,Phyllis
"You're right, you're right. Just, Dwight, do it. Just say it ok.",Michael
[exhales] I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.,Dwight
"Finally. Right? Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams. Why don't you have a seat? [Phyllis sits] Let's all clap at Phyllis. [everyone claps] Ok! [in Michael Clump voice] When Michael Clump wants to remind you [normal voice] that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy. And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly. Kelly. [kneels down in front of Kelly, Dwight tries to help him down, Michael shouts gibberish at him] Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair. Come on, stand up on your chair. Stand up, stand up, stand up. Somebody help her. Here we go. [Kelly stands up on her chair] Ok, I want you to look at her. She's a beautiful Indian woman. Why? What makes her beautiful?",Michael
[stands up] Everything. She's perfect.,Ryan
I like her nails.,Meredith
"Ok, be more specific.",Michael
I like her fingernails.,Meredith
I like her purple dress.,Phyllis
What about her looks?,Michael
Hell of an ass.,Creed
...what else do people like?,Kelly
I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.,Phyllis
"Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?",Michael
"I hate dieting, I hate it so much. I hate this worm inside of me!",Kelly
"I want you to know. Kelly, look at me! I want you to know that you are beautiful. You are truly, truly beautiful. Give me a hug. [Michael hugs Kelly, his head in her chest] Mmmmmm.",Michael
Summers going great. Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump. I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer. My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days. How's your summer?,Jim
"Hey Ryan, look. Shaved off my goatee. I am goateeless. We are the goateeless brothers.",Michael
Oh...,Ryan
"Ahaha, Yep! [Dwight looks down depressingly and rubs his new goatee]",Michael
How was Friday night?,Oscar
"Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call. I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so...",Holly
He'll call.,Oscar
"Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.",Michael
You guys lost four pounds.,Darryl
Hey!,Michael
I say we have a parade.,Darryl
We better.,Dwight
Excellent! Good job.,Michael
"So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so...",Jim
You've already disappointed him so much. He can't be expecting a lot from you.,Pam
I know. I suck.,Jim
"Yes, you do.",Dwight
Dwight says 'Hi.',Jim
I do not! I do not say 'Hi' Pam!,Dwight
Now he is saying 'Hi' louder.,Jim
"I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right?",Pam
Umm...,Jim
"No football games, recitals, karate tournaments.",Pam
"Hey, can you go to IM?",Jim
OK.,Pam
OK.,Jim
Let's meet for lunch.,JIM9334 [screen name]
What are you writing about me?,Dwight
What -- today?,Receptionitis15 [screen name]
Yeah. C'mon we'll meet halfway. You'll be back for your 4 o'clock class.,JIM9334
I'm gonna write you both up for not working.,Dwight
I'm gonna write you up for not working.,Jim
"Ok, well played. Neither of us'll write the other up for not working.",Dwight
Where?,Receptionitis15
"The rest stop where that soda exploded on me. Exit 17, I think. 1 o'clock.",JIM9334
Alright. See you there. : ) P.S. I finally finished my,Receptionitis15
[holds up an ASCII image of Dwight],Jim
"Yeah, oh, hey. Did he call?",Michael
I just got off... Kendall? I just got off...,Holly
"No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy. What, what happened? Did he call?",Michael
"Oh, no.",Holly
Really?,Micheal
No.,Holly
Aach.,Micheal
And you know what? I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise. Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?,Holly
"I dunno. I always call everybody back right away. He'll call back though. Give him until the end of the day, he'll call. If he doesn't, he is loco.",Michael
"Thanks. That's sweet. Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.",Holly
Ugh.,Michael
"Well, at least everyone lost weight. That's all that really matters.",Holly
"Wait, do we have until the end of the day?",Michael
"So we're only eight pounds behind Utica. Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.",Holly
"Leave it to me, boss. I can get this whole office to make weight. [turns up thermostat] It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.",Andy
Andy Bernard does not lose contests. He wins them... or he quits them because they are unfair.,Andy
"[Kelly eating in the break room] Hey, is that healthy food?",Michael
Nope.,Kelly
"We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly. Please?",Michael
"Hey, Michael. I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.",Jim
"Ok, that is fine. Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?",Michael
Perfect.,Jim
[sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray],Dwight
I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.,Angela
Your wish is my command.,Andy
"Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?",Angela
Of course!,Andy
Really?,Angela
Yeah! I mean it's a great song. I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway. You know?,Andy
Mmhmm.,Angela
And you know what? The guys already know it so it's easy breezy.,Andy
The guys?,Angela
I didn't tell you.,Andy
Mm-mm,Angela
"Here Comes Treble, class of '96 was available for our big day, so, I booked 'em.",Andy
I don't think that...,Angela
"And, they are collectively my best man. And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so... it totally works out.",Andy
I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.,Angela
"Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker. But you know what? You're gonna love these guys. Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich. These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for.",Andy
[Angela dials the phone] Let's talk about this later. [Dwight's pager buzzes],Angela
"Mm-wah! [Angela walks away, Dwight follows]",Andy
"Hey! This is not half-way! I did the math. I had to drive way longer than you. Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.",Pam
[Jim gets down on one knee],Jim
What are you doing?,Pam
I just... couldn't wait.,Jim
Oh my God!,Pam
"Pam, will you marry me?",Jim
Oh my God!,Pam
So?,Jim
Yes! [they embrace and kiss],Pam
God. Where is Jim?,Dwight
I'm calling it. I guess that's curtains for the yoga guy.,Holly
"Aww, really?",Michael
Yeah.,Holly
"I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing...",Michael
Yeah?,Holly
...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.,Michael
"Aww man, I really wanted to see them.",Holly
I know. I love Counting Crows.,Michael
Look at where my seats were.,Holly
"Wow, really?",Michael
Yeah.,Holly
That's a shame. A shame to waste these. I want to buy them from you.,Michael
"Michael, you don't have to buy them.",Holly
"I do. No. I do. I, I want to. Trust me. I really do.",Michael
Ok.,Holly
Ok?,Michael
Yeah.,Holly
"Alright. Alright! [tears up tickets] Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok? Case closed. Umm, can I pay you tomorrow? I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so...",Michael
Yeah.,Holly
Is that good?,Michael
Yeah.,Holly
"Hey, sorry everybody.",Jim
What are you smiling about there smiley pants? You're late.,Dwight
Wet Tuna!,Andy
Hey Dwight.,Jim
OK.,Michael
"What's up, Meredith?",Jim
Nothing.,Meredith
Dripping on me.,Dwight
"Darryl, would you do the honors?",Michael
Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys.,Darryl
"Nonono, no, no, I don't want to hear moaning. This is a good day. You guys accomplished something big. You lost a ton of weight, literally. A lot of weight. And I don't care what any stupid scale says. You guys are all gigantic losers.",Michael
I don't know about anyone else. But it was a good summer for me. I lost seven pounds. And you know what? I'm just gonna take five days off anyway.,Stanley
"[in a hospital bed, watching Entourage in Spanish] Oh, I went zip lining my third day in Costa Rica. I guess the harness wasn't strapped in exactly right. I broke my neck. And, I've been in the hospital five weeks now. I still haven't seen the beach. It's nice to have visitors.",Toby
[to Holly] I'm doing the blood type diet.,Kelly
Who gives a f[bleep]?,Meredith
What'd you say h[bleep]?,Kelly
"Okay, great. I got it.",Holly
Look what just arrived from the Nashua branch. [reads from card attached to gift basket] 'Here's something to enjoy on your three non-vacation days. Nashua branch.' Can I send them a dead deer?,Dwight
"No, you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna take that and we are going to us it as a reward for the end of our competition.",Michael
Classy.,Dwight
"My dream vacation? I sleep in, putter around the farm, go fishing for a few hours, take a long run in the forest, check the traps. Then the sun comes up and I head into work, which is empty, because everyone else is out of town on vacation.",Dwight
"[seeing Kevin throw out bunch of M&Ms] Nice job, Kevin. [Kevin fills jar back up with another candy]",Oscar
"I'm pretty fit. But in the gay community, there's a lot of pressure to be ripped. I got straight abs. I want gay abs.",Oscar
Can you turn the heat down now - it's oppressive.,Oscar
"Yeah, totally. I'm sorry, Oscar. Yeah, I didn't realize it was bothering you.",Andy
It's just...,Oscar
"Cause it's kind of bothering all of us, 'cause it's really hot, you know, it's hot, so we can lose weight, so we don't screw up this whole contest for the entire freaking office, but if you want, I'll turn it down.",Andy
"Hello, hello. Hey! Your face is almost back to normal.",Michael
"One more kid calls me 'Hellboy,' I swear to God...",Meredith
"Oh, you wish. Hellboy's a hero.",Dwight
These guys took me out on their fishing boat. I don't think I caught anything.,Meredith
Have you been to the beach yet?,Oscar
"[on the computer] No, but I'm going zip lining tomorrow, through the, through the rainforest, with this cool couple I, I met at my hotel. Wo-woman's amazing...",Toby
"Hey, Oscar! Come on, let's go!",Michael
"Okay, Toby, I gotta go.",Oscar
"Hey, is that Michael? Does he miss me? [laughs] Uh, Oscar? Are you there? Hello? [sighs]",Toby
I am suspending you without pay for the rest of the year.,Michael
"No, you're not.",Jim
"Okay, no, I am not. Dwight! [Dwight runs into Michael's office] I want you to take Jim's chair. No! No! His chair at his desk. He gets it back on Friday.",Michael
All right!,Dwight
I want you to get your ass out of my face.,Michael
"[sitting on a stack of paper] Yeah, well, if you're only free till three on Sunday and I can't get there till one, then it's gonna be pretty tight.",Jim
[from his office] That's what she said.,Michael
"[as Dwight tries to take paper out from under him] Hey, can you not?",Jim
"Can you not? No sitting devices, Michael's rules.",Dwight
"No, no, no, definitely, definitely. Yes. Next weekend, then. All right! I love you, too.",Jim
Gah! [tries to dislodge paper with his feet],Dwight
"Hey, um, my daughter said you traded her a headband for her Nintendo DS?",Darryl
"Oh yeah, she loves that headband.",Kelly
She's six.,Darryl
She manipulates you.,Kelly
"Okay, I'm gonna need you to make this right or else we can't be right.",Darryl
I never know when you're kidding.,Kelly
"I can't feel... I can't feel anything that you're doing, Michael.",Jan
Well...,Michael
It's like nothing's happening.,Jan
You're...you know what? I read in one of those books that you're not even supposed to give foot massages because it can induce labor.,Michael
"Oh, just stop making excuses and just dig in there.",Jan
I'm digging.,Michael
"When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father... by telling us he was the father. But then we got this e-mail from Jan. [waves paper and reads from it] 'Hi, everyone! Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor. First, the great news - I am expecting. The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line (shameless plug, I know, don't hate me, LOL). Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met. Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father. Best, Jan. P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.'",Jim
I can't wait to be a father. I'm going to smother that baby.,Michael
"Uh, new wicks from Craft Corner, uh, this dress [hands Michael bag] returned to Suburban Casuals, and uh, panty liners.",Jan
"I really, I don't want to get panty liners, please...",Michael
"Well, I, you said you wanted to help, so I...",Jan
"I know, it's...",Michael
Will you be able to milk with those implants?,Dwight
You mean breastfeed?,Jan
"Yeah. [Jan starts to get up] Easy there, old girl. [tries to help her]",Dwight
"Uh, I'm fine, thank you.",Jan
Okay.,Dwight
"Would you just call me when you're done with the errands, Michael?",Jan
Yes.,Michael
[as Jan leaves room] Careful. Hmm. She was a keeper.,Dwight
I want you to get the panty liners.,Michael
Done.,Dwight
"[on the phone] Well, I should go.",Pam
Alright. I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.,Jim
"No, don't. I'm mad at them.",Pam
"Why, what happened?",Jim
Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.,Pam
Ah. That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.,Jim
What? Why not?,Pam
"I just didn't, you know, want a deal.",Jim
"Come on, it won't be that bad.",Pam
"OK. You know what? Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody? I just want to make an announcement. Pam and I are engaged.",Jim
[speakerphone] Hi everyone!,Pam
I thought you were already engaged.,Oscar
Nope.,Jim
That was Roy. She was engaged to Roy.,Angela
Thank you Angela.,Jim
I got a gift for Pam and Roy. Do I have to get another one?,Kevin
Yes.,Jim
"A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what's your game here?",Andy
To get married.,Jim
"[raises hand] She's not a virgin, you know.",Dwight
Wow.,Pam
[walking in] What's going on?,Michael
"No, nothing. Nothing Michael! Just saying hi. [Michael waves 'hi' at the phone]",Pam
The tall guy got engaged.,Creed
[to Jim] To be married?,Michael
Yep. [Michael hugs/tackles Jim],Jim
Sorry.,Pam
"Pencils down! [Dwight quickly puts his pencil down] Just kidding, take your time.",Holly
"Today is ethics day. After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here. It's gonna be insaaaaane. No, it's not. I have to read from the binder.",Holly
"[trying to assist Michael, who is trying to press play on a CD player] I got it, I got it. [Olivia Newton-John's 'Let's Get Physical' starts to play as Holly and Michael jog into the meeting room, dancing]",Dwight
Let's get ethical! Ethical! I wanna get ethical! Let's get into Ethics yeah! Let me hear that Dunder Mifflin talk! Your body talk. Let me hear your body talk.,Michael & Holly
WOO! Alright!,Michael
Why are you helping her? You're not even dating.' She's my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing. Uh...,Michael
"Ok, let's give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax! [everyone claps]",Michael
"Thanks Michael. [Michael groans exhaustingly] Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired.",Holly
"Oh come on! He's right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired. [to Jim] Oh check it out, 'Hired Guy.'",Kevin
Nice. [they bump fists],Jim
"Ok, elephant in the room. Let's talk about it. Do I regret what I did? Of course I do. Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example. Anyone see Survivor season six? [Dwight raises his hand] Anyone know Joanna on that show? [Dwight nods] In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that. Indistinguishable. So...",Ryan
"[clapping] Ok. Well done. Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy.",Michael
"Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning. It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree. But ideally you would have selected totally agree.",Holly
I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.,Phyllis
Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.,Holly
"Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic. [claps]",Michael
"Thank you. In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.",Holly
What?,Kelly
"Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company. Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?",Holly
This meeting.,Stanley
Hey-oh!,Andy
Yes.,Dwight
[to Holly] Can't set 'em up like that.,Michael
"Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time? If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking. I'll do it. I don't care.",Kelly
I'll smoke with you. I got a bag of cigars in my purse.,Meredith
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.,Holly
Can we have a moment? [whispering] Can I talk to you for a sec? Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic.,Michael
Michael.,Dight
Yeah.,Michael
What should we be working on while you guys are talking?,Dwight
"Do some... do some work. [whispering to Holly] People expect a lot from these meetings. Laughter, sudden twists. Surprise endings. You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan. You need to be Robin Shyamalan.",Michael
"Well, I just have to get through the binder.",Holly
Do you... just... you're kind of losing them.,Michael
I am?,Holly
"Yeah, don't think about the stakes. It'll freak you out.",Micheal
"Ok. [to everyone] Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil. That's not right.",Holly
"[coughs to hide his words] Lauren, [coughs] enough with the pencils.",Michael
"No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies. It's part of the ethics thing.",Holly
That isn't ethics. Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good. This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.,Oscar
I'll drop an ethics bomb on you. Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom!,Andy
"Exactly, Andy.",Oscar
"Yeah, I took intro to philosophy,",Andy
"It's a trick question. The bread is poisoned. Also, it's not your real family. You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.",Dwight
No that's... not how it works.,Andy
I would not... steal the bread. And I would not let my family go hungry.,Michael
"Ok, but we should get back to business. Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.",Holly
"Anybody? This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions. Stanley? Oscar, come on.",Michael
Pass.,Oscar
I will go first. When I discovered,Michael
What was the dilemma?,Holly
To tell you or not. And I'm glad I did. I feel very very good. Cathartic. I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble. You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.,Michael
Oh--- no no no.,Holly
"Yeah, [interrupting gibberish]. Come on, anybody. Let it fly.",Michael
"Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch.",Oscar
A siesta!,Michael
Time thief. Time thief! Fire him!,Dwight
"Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?",Jim
Never!,Dwight
You are a thief of joy. Anybody else. Yeah?,Michael
Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.,Kelly
Who hasn't? Good. Good! What else?,Michael
"No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that.",Holly
Mmm...,Michael
"I once reported Oscar to the INS. Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it.",Angela
"Well, let's keep this party movin' on.",Michael
"I'll go. Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?",Meredith
Bruuuuuuuuuce.,Michael
Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.,Meredith
Jackpot.,Jim
Ach! Wuh---,Michael
"Meredith, that is serious. I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods.",Holly
"Exchange of steak. Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?",Meredith
"That's crazy. That's crazy talk! Meredith! The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers! Hoo-ooh! Wow! What time we got? [checks watch] You know what? That's a good place to end it. Right there. This, I think, was a great ethics seminar. She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about. Right... what is wrong. Who's to say? Really. In the end. I mean because it is... unknowable. But, let's give her a round of applause. Holly, everybody. Holly! Get back to work. [everyone applauds, then leaves] [to Holly] Great job. I am truly impressed. That, uh, you really pulled that one out. Classic. Classic meeting. We should celebrate.",Michael
"Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.",Holly
Oh...,Michael
I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line.,Holly
Nnyeah. What ya gonna do?,Micheal
"So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?",Holly
"Liaisons, you mean meet-ups? I don't know, once a month for six years. Something like that.",Meredith
"Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks. Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.",Michael
Am I in trouble here or something?,Meredith
"No... no, this is just a stupid formality.",Michael
"No, it's not a formality. Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal? Unrelated to business?",Holly
"Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper. There's not a lot of fruit in those looms.",Meredith
Ughh! For the love of God we're trying to help you... stupid bag.,Micheal
"What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons? I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?",Holly
"Well it's funny. Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here? I thought I had immunity?",Meredith
Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace. I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this.,Holly
Well... I'm not quitting.,Meredith
"[starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn. Four seconds.",Jim
What are you doing?,Dwight
Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.,Jim
"Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn? That's absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody! He's ti--- [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch]",Dwight
Personal conversation. Seventeen seconds.,Jim
There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch],Dwight
[stops the watch] One second.,Jim
"Well, well. Holly... lujah! It's a miracle, you're at your desk.",Michael
It's Mike-raculous.,Holly
"Hoo-ooh! Reaching! You'll get there. Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out.",Michael
Sounds good.,Holly
Good. Would you care to bang it out over lunch?,Michael
Oh I already bought this...,Holly
"Oh no, no, no. Your food is no good here, my lady. [sweeps her food into the trash can, misses] Sorry! You know what? Let's go out! Dunder Mifflin's treat. Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it? Ethical.",Michael
"So, I've gone over corporate policy.",Holly
What do you think? What do you think of this place?,Michael
"Oh, it's very nice.",Holly
"Istn't it? Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic. So you're from Des Moines?",Michael
Mmm.,Holly
"Wow, that sounds so... warm.",Michael
In Summer.,Holly
Here too. You know what my favorite season is?,Michael
Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.,Holly
"Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way. Autumn was what I was going to say. When the leaves change. It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.",Michael
"Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated.",Holly
"Wow, terminator, terminator.",Michael
I'm from da future.,Holly
Yeah.,Michael
"Hey, Andy.",Jim
Yo.,Andy
"By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?",Jim
"No, I did not. Was that any good?",Andy
Actually not. It was really so-so.,Jim
"Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it]",Dwight
"I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff. You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?",Jim
Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?,Andy
"You know, it's weird. It's practically a shot for shot remake.",Jim
"Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that's cool.",Andy
Story's kinda bland. It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.,Jim
Really? That doesn't sound right.,Andy
"I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance. I mean, what sort of place is that to call home? And Meredith needs this job. This is her main source of money.",Michael
"Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol. Those are the rules.",Holly
"Ok, new idea. We don't report it at all. We just punish her.",Michael
We punish her?,Holly
"Mmhmm, tell her she can't have sex for six months.",Michael
I don't think we could enforce that.,Holly
"I don't know. I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.",Michael
A chastity belt.,Holly
"No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal. You know what I am talking about. You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the...",Michael
"He has not stopped working for a second. At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible. At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports. And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work. It's exhausting, being this vigilant. I'll probably have to go home early today.",Jim
I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying.,Michael
"No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.",Holly
Yes.,Michael
What am I saying?,Holly
Well... bleh busted. I don't...,Michael
I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.,Holly
"Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.",Michael
It's not a family. It's a workplace.,Holly
I will be honest with you. That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault. The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her. And I am holding on to her leftovers. [throws Holly's leftovers in the trash],Michael
[Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds. What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?,Jim
None of your business.,Dwight
So I guess I can assume that was personal.,Jim
"[Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine.",Dwight
So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.,Jim
"Yes, maybe I'm not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera]",Dwight
It's been a little tense. People are suspicious of me. And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular. I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker. I was just hoping middle school was over.,Holly
Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.,Ryan
What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?,Michael
Two HR reps.,Ryan
You get me.,Michael
Can I sit?,Holly
"I don't know. Can you? Kendall, my main man.",Michael
"[on speakerphone] Listen, Holly, Michael, I just got the report that your branch submitted and there's a lot of stuff about a relationship Meredith is having with..",Kendall
"Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.",Holly
Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.,Michael
"Well, I'm not sure these circumstances warrant any action.",Kendall
"Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.",Holly
"Well, from what I can gather it seems like a gray area. Look, to be honest the company is getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet and I don't know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that.",Kendall
"Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it.",Holly
"I thought it was clear with you, Holly. Your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the training.",Kendall
"No, I understand.",Holly
Every other branch has managed to get this to us so if it's not something you can handle then that's a different discussion.,Kendall
No. I can do it.,Holly
Good.,Kendall
"How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, 'I told you so.' Gently with a rose? In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke? Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way.",Michael
"Can I have everyone's attention? Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please. We need to finish the ethics seminar.",Holly
"No way, lady.",Andy
It's a trap.,Kevin
"Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.",Holly
Don't sign anything.,Meredith
"Ok, everybody listen up. If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.",Michael
It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.,Stanley
Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it! [everyone gets up to go in the conference room],Michael
Am I getting fired?,Meredith
"Now is really not the time, Meredith.",Michael
"In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days. Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers. Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.",Holly
"Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.",Phyllis
"Hey, where is the steak sauce?",Meredith
I think we're out.,Kevin
I got some in my minivan somewhere.,Meredith
"Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?",Andy
"I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash.",Kevin
I don't care what she's doing. I just hope she keeps doing it.,Phyllis
Amen. Just keep the ribs coming.,Stanley
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.,Holly
That's a big ethical area?,Oscar
"Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics. Why isn't the company doing better? Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week. Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance. I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar.",Oscar
"I've done some things I'm not proud of. Committed some atrocities in Vietnam, uh, two years ago. Princess Cruise Lines.",Creed
"During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he'd been drinking, and suddenly thump. We hit something with our jeep. It was probably a man. We didn't know what to do. We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could. We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home. Maybe it was just an ostrich. In a soccer uniform.",Phyllis
Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place?,Holly
Let's keep this rollin'... Ryan?,Michael
"Oh, but you mean other than embezzling?",Jim
"Fraud, Jim, Fraud.",Ryan
Fraud.,Jim
"Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car. I never said a thing.",Ryan
"Wait, what?",Kevin
You knocked the mirror off of my car.,Kevin
"Yeah, isn't that messed up?",Ryan
Yeah.,Kevin
That guy did a lot of things I'm not proud of.,Ryan
"Wait, when you say 'that guy', you mean you?",Kevin
"I mean the guy I used to be. I'm Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too. [tries to walk away]",Ryan
"No, you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you... too?",Kevin
"Look, I feel you okay? That guy took no responsibility for his actions.",Ryan
"But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?",Kevin
If I have to answer for everything that guy did... [shakes head] I'm never gonna move on.,Ryan
It was like two hundred dollars.,Kevin
"We're never going to get what need from that guy. [still shaking head, pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen]",Ryan
"Hey, anybody see a pair of sunglasses?",Ryan
"Umm... I think I saw some in the kitchen. [toaster oven bell rings, Ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he see's his melted sunglasses on the tray, Ryan takes cooked sunglasses to Kevin] Oh! I didn't do that. That was Kevin 1.0, but he hurt a lot of people Ryan, and I can't accept responsibility for what he did. [Ryan walks away and throws his sunglasses in the trash, Kevin smiles]",Kevin
What are we gonna do?,Meredith
About what?,Stanley
Holly. She's on the warpath. She is gunning for all our jobs. Do you guys have any dirt on her?,Meredith
Mmm... sometimes her stockings have a run in them.,Phyllis
No. Something I can blackmail her with.,Meredith
"One time I said good morning to her, and she didn't say it back.",Phyllis
"Stanley, didn't she say a bunch of racist stuff to you?",Meredith
"No, that was you.",Stanley
You weren't even in the room! Thanks for nothing.,Meredith
"Hey, how did it go?",Meredith
"Oh, cr..., oh, God. Meredith, you know what? I just need a minute, okay?",Michael
Okay. [remains sitting],Meredith
What do you need?,Michael
"I'm getting fired, aren't I? I can't get fired. I got nothing else. Nothing. No skill set. Can't type, bad on the phone, not great with people.",Meredith
I... really want to keep you.,Michael
Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four?,Meredith
"Wait, what?",Michael
I wish Toby was still here.,Meredith
Nnnngah!,Michael
[looking pregnant] Hey Michael?,Dwight
Yeah.,Michael
Contractions are coming every ten minutes.,Dwight
"OK, just remember to keep breathing.",Michael
My cervix is ripening.,Dwight
"OK, good.",Michael
"[drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight. Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion.",Jim
Michael! My water's breaking!,Dwight
"Oh, OK! OK!",Michael
Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?,Dwight
I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.,Michael
Right. Highways or surface roads?,Dwight
I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.,Michael
"No, Gibson is covered in potholes. Your car breaks down. Adapt!",Dwight
"I checked the route - there are no potholes. Come on, get in here and have the baby.",Michael
It's about adapting to the circumstances.,Dwight
"[annoyed] Andy, would you like to have my baby?",Michael
Yes! Yeah. [squatting and pushing] Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!,Andy
"No. OK, no. I'm crowning! I'm crowning! Aaaaaaaa! [runs into Michael's office]",Dwight
"All right, OK. [to Andy] Sorry. Sorry. Here we go. Here we go!",Michael
The pressure! The pressure!,Dwight
"Do it! Do it! Scream! Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.",Michael
Aaaaaaaa!,Dwight
Aaaaaaaa!,Michael
"Babies are one of my many areas of expertise. Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.",Dwight
Just keep pushing...,Michael
[lying on Michael's desk] Hold me!,Dwight
I'm right here.,Michael
Cradle my head!,Dwight
"I'm right here, I'm right here.",Michael
"I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa!",Dwight
[annoyed] All right. Dwight. Just push and breathe.,Michael
Numb me up. I want anesthesia!,Dwight
"Shhh. No, you can't have it. It's too late.",Michael
No! I don't want natural!,Dwight
No. You have to just push it out!,Michael
OK!,Dwight
Keep simulating.,Michael
Aaaaaaaa!,Dwight
OK!,Michael
Do you have the Sharpie?!,Dwight
Keep simulating.,Michael
Do you have the Sharpie?!,Dwight
"Yes, I do!",Michael
"OK! When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.",Dwight
OK.,Michael
Ready?!,Dwight
Yes.,Michael
Aaaaaaaa!,Dwight
Aaaaaaaa! It's coming! Here we go! [drops the watermelon onto the floor] Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?,Michael
Butter. Newborns are slippery.,Dwight
Nice touch. Good. Let's try that again.,Michael
[eating the watermelon] It is going to be the happiest day of my life. [Dwight gets dressed behind Michael and zips his fly],Michael
"Hello ladies, how's my shower going? Phyllis, did you get the live storks?",Michael
No.,Phyllis
"Damnit, Phyllis! I'm sorry. [more softly] Damnit, Phyllis. It was hard enough to convince Jan to come. So are we set for refreshments?",Michael
"Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names. This is your boy bowl, with the name 'Chevy.' And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name 'Astird.'",Angela
That can't be right.,Phyllis
Michael wrote down 'Astird.',Angela
She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...,Michael
Ass...turd.,Meredith
"I know. I know. It is beautiful. No. Thank you. Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons? You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up. I think you need to get the lead out. Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here. We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower. Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?",Michael
"It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine. I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub. Have you seen that video? It is... it's so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens.",Michael
"Hey, I'm collecting for the baby shower.",Phyllis
"But Phyllis, it's not his baby.",Kevin
"I know, Kevin.",Phyllis
Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?,Oscar
"Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby. Sheet cake.",Phyllis
"I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee. I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine.",Phyllis
"[banging on the glass] Hey, hey. What are you doing? Don't talk to them.",Michael
Sorry.,Phyllis
"Make the party. Don't - make the party, please, Phyllis. [Phyllis starts inflating a balloon with a pump] Pump it!",Michael
"[on phone] So you know Stacy, right?",Pam
"Right, the one from England.",Jim
"There's no one from England, Jim. Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.",Pam
"Oh. Right, that style.",Jim
"So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab.",Pam
OK...,Jim
"Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in.",Pam
"Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen?",Jim
"No, Sarah Kaya comes in. Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.",Pam
OK.,Jim
"So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, 'No way. You can't reserve seats.' And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box.",Pam
[clearly just humoring her] No... way!,Jim
Yes!,Pam
Ha ha. That's hilarious?,Jim
"No, it's horrible! Jim, she might get arrested.",Pam
"Who, Stacy?",Jim
"No, Stacy is a boy. Ugh. Frustrating. Why can't you just be in art class with me?",Pam
Uh...,Jim
"Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting. [hangs up]",Pam
"OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. [hangs up] That was a good story.",Jim
Who's Sarah Kayacombsen?,Dwight
Yo. I got the Nard-puppy for ya. What's going on here?,Andy
It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.,Angela
Awww. Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby?,Andy
That's Phyllis.,Angela
Well -,Andy
"Yeah, it is. So I hope you two are very happy together. Pervert.",Angela
"Why would that make me a pervert, I -",Andy
"Well, it does. That's me.",Angela
That's not you.,Andy
Yes it is.,Angela
"That's mean, come on, that's - [Angela storms out]",Andy
"Ahoy, matey.",Michael
Ahoy.,Holly
"Ahoy. So, how you doin'?",Michael
Good.,Holly
"Um, listen. Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest. It's all kind of weird. Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive. And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office. So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you. And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings. And I'm treating Ryan the same way.",Michael
Of course. Yeah.,Holly
"I do not like pregnant women in my workspace. They're always complaining. I have varicose veins, too. I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too? Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital?",Stanley
"[Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan.",Jim
"Hi, Jim!",Jan
What do we have here?,Jim
This is my baby.,Jan
Really...,Jim
Oh no... [Michael enters and notices Jan's baby],Dwight
Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it. So the baby could be anybody's. Except Michael's.,Dwight
So this is Astird.,Michael
Astrid.,Jan
"Oh, OK. Why didn't you call me?",Michael
"Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-",Jan
I could have helped.,Michael
"And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so...",Jan
"Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.",Michael
"OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's...",Jan
"No, I don't!",Michael
"I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.",Jan
Can I hold her?,Michael
"Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.",Jan
"[cradling the car seat awkwardly] All right, OK.",Michael
"I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways. I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me. It feeds my soul. Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them. But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit. If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war. There would be no government, and things could get terrible. It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.",Michael
"[carrying the car seat] Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: Assst...",Michael
trid.,Jan
"...trid Levinson. Hi! Astrid, this is everybody, look. This is your family. You're going to know them for the rest of your life.",Michael
Well...,Jan
"[looking at Creed] Well, he may not be here. Say hello! OK, here we go. [lifting the car seat high above his head] Lion King!",Michael
"Michael, Michael, Michael, that's... yeah... that's too high. I'll take that.",Jan
"OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.",Michael
You OK? You seem kind of...,Holly
"[sees Jan sizing up Holly] I'm fine, weirdo. Such an HR weirdo. Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.",Michael
Ready to play some games? Let's do it!,Michael
"Michael, the baby's already been born.",Kevin
"Uh, duh.",Michael
So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.,Kevin
"No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK? The baby multiplies the fun. Let's just do what you were going to do.",Michael
OK... Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?,Kevin
"All right, how about some presents? I want to see some presents. [holding a memo pad] I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.",Michael
Thank you. That's very sweet of you.,Jan
Whatta we got?,Michael
"Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.",Angela
Oh!,Michael
Thank you.,Jan
She already has a stroller.,Michael
And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.,Kelly
She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller.,Oscar
Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.,Dwight
"OK, what else?",Michael
"Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter. For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator]",Dwight
[singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' to Astrid] Being good isn't always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He'd come and tell me everything is all right / He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one...,Jan
Hey you!,Pam
[on phone] Hey! You busy?,Jim
Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month.,Pam
"OK, OK, so you gotta hear this. So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' and everyone's just staring at her.",Jim
"I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going-",Pam
"The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!",Jim
I can't hear anything!,Pam
"Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.",Jim
OK.,Pam
"I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync. You know, that's all. Oh, great. I washed my lipstick.",Pam
"[now belting out the lyrics, even though Astrid is asleep] How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one...",Jan
"[heaving the stroller into a tire yard] Don't hit the fence. Oh no, my child!",Dwight

"So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth.",Andy
"Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth. And it was really, really quite amazing.",Jan
You gave birth in a tub?,Angela
"Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.",Jan
"Um, so you're in the tub with everything?",Kelly
"Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah.",Jan
Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach.,Creed
"Oh no, it's actually really hygienic, Creed.",Jan
Ugh.,Creed
I'm done.,Stanley
Me too.,Oscar
And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth. [everyone starts leaving],Jan
"Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No. No. This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.",Michael
I could have helped.,Michael
"You're sad about this. I know that, and I wish that I... but... would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?",Jan
"[smiling] Uh, yeah.",Michael
"All right. Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes. I'm exhausted, so um. Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529. Wake me in twenty.",Jan
"[voiceover] I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged.",Michael
Phyllis? Could you take-.,Michael
Hey guys.,Michael
"What's up, Mike?",Darryl
"Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.",Michael
You a baby daddy?,Darryl
"Yeah, I a baby daddy. Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby? Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?",Michael
Hell yeah. You know why? Because that was my baby.,Darryl
I just saw this baby daddy-,Michael
You should stop calling yourself 'baby daddy.',Darryl
"Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote?",Michael
"Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby.",Darryl
Well-,Michael
You feel connected to his baby over there?,Darryl
It's- that's different.,Michael
You feel connected to this? [hold up his back brace],Darryl
That's not a baby.,Michael
"You want to hold me, to see how you feel?",Darryl
[sighs] Could I?,Michael
No.,Darryl
[wakes up on the reception couch] Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.,Jan
I can imagine.,Holly
Where's Astrid?,Jan
"Oh, I think she's on a sales call.",Holly
On a what?,Jan
"Waaa! More paper! Waaa! [she cracks herself up but Jan is unimpressed] No, she's just on a coffee break.",Holly
[sarcastically] That's funny.,Jan
She's with Angela.,Holly
"[with Astrid covered in and surrounded by vegetables on a lunch table] That's good. Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here. Get the baby to look up here, ready?",Angela
OK. Yeah. Look at my finger. Look. Looook!,Andy
"Now. Come on, up here!",Angela
Look up here!,Andy
Your hand's in it.,Angela
What? Sorry.,Andy
"Yeah, that's a good one.",Angela
What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me.,Jan
We're taking a picture.,Andy
[picking up Astrid] There you are.,Jan
She's nature's bounty.,Andy
You don't flash around a newborn baby. Don't you know that?,Jan
"Michael, I need your help.",Jan
"[sees Holly behind Jan] I was just going to... I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene. She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.",Michael
Uh... come on.,Jan
I like to call this... the bumper test. [drags the stroller behind his car and runs into it several times],Dwight
Sure you can't stay a little longer?,Michael
"Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.",Jan
"All right. All right, everybody, we're leaving. Jan and Astrid are leaving.",Michael
"You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?",Jan
Oh. I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.,Dwight
"Ah. Thanks, Dwight.",Jan
"OK. You know what? There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.",Jan
OK?,Michael
Don't date Holly.,Jan
"Wha - that's, I hate her. Wha - God! Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine.",Michael
Thanks for the baby shower. It was great. And I'll see you... soon.,Jan
All right.,Michael
OK.,Jan
You still gonna be mean to me?,Holly

You must be out or something.,Jim
I'll leave a message.,Pam
"Is it me, or are we just a little off today?",Jim
I guess this is just one of those days. It'll get better.,Pam
Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.,Jim
I finished my laundry. Got all my socks. Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.,Pam
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?,Jim
"And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?",Pam
"Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat. Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly. Be safe.",Jim
"You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now. But, don't worry, I'm being safe. And I'm headed home. I'm... headed to my dorm. Not home.",Pam
"Wish you were home. Uh, anyway...",Jim
"Anyway, um... I miss you.",Pam
I miss you.,Jim
"All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother's belly is?",Angela
Oh! OK!,Michael
Well...,Jan
How many squares of toilet paper go around the waist?,Angela
Does that mean there's no toilet paper in the bathroom?,Kevin
"Kevin, relax.",Angela
"OK, you know what, I don't think I need to do this one, because I only gained twelve pounds and I'm just going to get rid of all of that, so...",Jan
Seventeen. I say seventeen squares.,Michael
"OK, give me the roll. I'll do it.",Jan
Do the boobs!,Michael
"Yeah, we're not doing my boobs, Michael. OK, seven, someone give me the prize. [to Astrid] Oh, it's OK...",Jan
Did she really just have a baby? She's so beautiful.,Holly
Oh yeah. Wait 'til you get to know her better though.,Jim
"Hey! HR lady, stop whispering in the corner please. Very rude. You're ruining the party.",Michael
I'm starting to get a feeling for what life was like around here for Toby.,Holly
[on the phone] It was terrible.,Toby
I know.,Holly
I prefer being stuck in a Costa Rican hospital.,Toby
Really?,Holly
Not really.,Toby
"Hey Jan, you went to a sperm bank?",Kevin
"Uh, yes, I did.",Jan
I donated sperm.,Kevin
Oh.,Jan
Maybe I'm the father.,Kevin
"Well, this is a highly exclusive establishment.",Jan
Next to the IHOP?,Kevin
"Well, I paid for an ideal specimen.",Jan
Are you saying Kevin is not an ideal specimen?,Oscar
"This is a wonderful shower, everyone. Thank you.",Jan
[to camera] I might have done it with Jan!,Kevin
"It's not Kevin's child. Can't possibly be. I mean, I don't know what I would do. Sue... icide?",Jan
"[Jan nurses Astrid with her top down, office workers try to work] Okay, 'Stridly, you want to try the other side? Okay, here we go. That's good. Oh, good job.",Jan

"You know what, Kevin? Why don't you just go ahead and stare? Because, you know, it's, it's fine with me. I mean, this is sooo natural, and so beautiful, and...",Jan
Seriously? You're okay with that?,Kevin
"Of course. I mean, there's nothing erotic about this, you know, it's, it's, it's what these [shakes a breast] were made for, you know, I mean they're full of baby milk, they're... nourishing my baby, so... [tosses head proudly, Creed comes up to stand next to Kevin, staring directly at Jan's chest] Michael!",Jan
"Hello, spoiled little baby, [to a watermelon] in your fancy brand name stroller. Mmm, I wonder if it's as safe as they say it is. Oh, look, a curb. Uh oh, let's see what happens... [lets it go, it flies off the curb, stays upright, and stops safely] Inconclusive. [pushes it out into the street, it rolls to a stop] Spartans would leave a weak baby by the side of the road. My parents left me beside the road. I crawled home.",Dwight
"Not so weak, huh, Mom?",Dwight
"Gosh, Mommy feels like taking a jog. [runs with stroller] Oh, no! Mommy forgot to wear a bra, and her big fake boobs are really hurting her, and she needs to let go, she can't control the stroller any longer [forcefully pushes stroller away toward uneven ground with junk strewn around, the stroller hits some junk, stays upright, and stops safely]",Dwight
"Let's see what this baby can do... [drives car fast, holding stroller alongside the car, stroller remains fine] Aaaah! Aa-aaah!

"Pam, line three.",Receptionist
"Okay, thanks.",Pam
"New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.",Pam

Hey.,Michael
Hello.,Holly
That was really fun last night.,Michael
"Yeah, it was nice.",Holly
I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.,Michael
"Oh, that would be great. You need that.",Holly
Yeah?,Michael
Yeah.,Holly
Oh really?,Michael
Yeah.,Holly
Well...,Michael
It would help.,Holly
"I, uh... [to camera] I let her win.",Michael
"[to camera] No, he didn't.",Holly
"So, when, um, can I see you again?",Michael
"Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager? [laughs]",Holly
No.,Michael
"I don't care, free tonight.",Holly
"Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good. [Holly's smile quickly fades] Because I am busy taking you out.",Michael
"[gasps] Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight.",Holly
[concerned] Why?,Michael
I'm going out with you.,Holly
"Wow... Oh, wait a second, I can't tonight...",Michael
[shakes head] No more.,Holly
Tonight's so...,Michael
No more.,Holly
"Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.",Michael
"Thank you, you too.",Holly
You're welcome.,Michael
"In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me I'll know for sure.",Michael
"That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date.",Andy
[whispering] You set a date?,Dwight
"J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money.",Andy
[sigh] What are you making?,Phyllis
A knife.,Dwight
You're making a knife with a knife?,Phyllis
You got a better way?,Dwight
You want to talk about it?,Phyllis
About what?,Dwight
You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.,Phyllis
"I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.",Dwight
"Oh, the mall could be fun.",Holly
Yeah.,Michael
We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.,Holly
"Some of what we order depends on whether we're having sex after. [laughs] Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have sex tonight?",Michael
...Hell yeah.,Holly
"Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first.",Michael
"Yeah, that's good.",Holly
Probably get soup or something light.,Michael
Hi.,Phyllis
"She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.",Dwight
It's nice to learn new things.,Phyllis
I was talking to myself.,Dwight
Okay.,Phyllis
I just don't get it.,Dwight
What don't you get?,Phyllis
Why is she marrying Andy?,Dwight
Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.,Phyllis
That's really fattening.,Dwight
"No, it's lettuce.",Phyllis
[playing cards] It's time to go.,Holly
"No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes. [sighs] [goofy voice] I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy.",Michael
"You're crazy, go crazy.",Holly
"[walking out of the building] Oh, I forgot my keys.",Holly
Do you need 'em?,Michael
"Yeah, lets go grab them.",Holly
All right.,Michael
"Oh, after vous. [walking into the girls bathroom]",Holly
Thank vous. [chuckling] What? Oh! [kissing],Michael
"I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?",Holly
Not if we turn these dials [getting louder] all the way down. [whispering] Now they can't hear us at all.,Michael
"Oh, good.",Holly
We're totally alone.,Michael
"Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.",Angela
"Great, they stole my laptop.",Oscar
"Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector.",Kevin
How does that even compare?,Oscar
"Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges.",Kevin
"Oh, my God, what happened?",Michael
We were robbed last night.,Jim
"Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.",Dwight
Can I talk to you for a second?,Holly
Yeah. Oh... oh!,Michael
"That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?",Holly
"No, did you?",Michael
Michael I think this is our fault.,Holly
"Oh, no, my God.",Michael
Oh...,Holly
Oh my God!,Michael
So much for sex without consequences.,Michael
[Jim holds up phone] You are such a dork! Shots!,Pam [on phone]

I'm not drunk.,Pam [on phone]
I'm on minute six of this message.,Jim
"Okay, I do not sound like that.",Pam [on phone]
You can take the girl out of Philly...,Man on phone

The future mother of my children.,Jim
I never felt safe here.,Angela
"You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind.",Andy
I would very much like that.,Angela
Yeah?,Andy
Yeah.,Angela
[cockney accent] Consider yourself... at home!,Andy
[Dwight groans] Ugh.,Dwight
Get in.,Dwight
Where are we going?,Phyllis
"I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.",Dwight
"Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.",Phyllis
Are you sure that's going to work?,Dwight
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.,Phyllis
"Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight...",Dwight
How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.,Holly
I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.,Oscar
Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? [whispering] Creed Bratton.,Creed
"We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?",Michael
"To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.",Michael
I think it's a fun idea.,Phyllis
Thank you.,Michael
We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.,Phyllis
"Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?",Michael
"Move on, Michael.",Phyllis
"Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days.",Michael
"So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?",Oscar
"I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here-",Michael
Do you need us for any of this?,Jim
Do I?,Michael
Michael scored the big ticket item. Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.,Holly
"Yeah, I think that's pretty boss.",Michael
He knows how to get things. He got me.,Holly
Whoa!,Michael
[giggles] Sorry.,Holly
Twice. ... Right?,Michael
Mm-hmm.,Holly
Mm-hmm.,Michael
Mm-hmm.,Holly
"Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt]",Dwight
I think you have me confused with another person.,Angela
I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14!,Dwight
I heard you. [quickly walks away],Angela
"Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Huey Lewis' Heart of Rock and Roll plays] Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen. [music stops] And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D. [clears throat] Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics.

Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce! [Huey Lewis' Heart of Rock and Roll plays]",Michael
"Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.",Darryl
"Okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for. Our first item up for bids tonight is something that I consider to be very boss indeed. [cheers and applause] It is a Yoga lesson from Holly Flax! Yoga! And I would like to start the bidding off at 300 dollars. [auctioneer voice] 300 dollars do I hear 300 dollars? 300 dollars. Hey, batter batter batter, hey batter, swing batter, 300 dollars, 300 dollars, 300 dollars. Anybody, 300 dollars. 400 dollars. Who wants for 400-[speaking gibberish] Do I see somebody in the back? Is there somebody in the back? Do I see somebody in the back? 400-450 [speaking gibberish] Sold! For 300 dollars to me! [bangs gavel, which squeaks] What the hell is that?",Michael
It's the only gavel I could find.,Phyllis
"It squeaks when you bang it, that's what she said. Let's hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!",Michael
"Hey Mike, do my thing.",Darryl
"Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-",Michael
"Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest.",Darryl
5 dollars.,Jim
Sold! To Jim.,Darryl
"Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says 'Creed.'",Michael
"Yeah, that's all-inclusive.",Creed

I can see that.,Jim

"What's up, Roy?",Darryl
Hey man.,Jim
I'm not gonna hit you or anything.,Roy

I'm good. How you doing?,Jim
I'm good.,Roy
"Yeah, okay.",Jim

"Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?",Dwight
Now you move on.,Phyllis
"Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back?",Dwight
"Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.",Phyllis
"Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.",Dwight
"Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.",Phyllis
Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. [Phyllis slaps Dwight] And you slap like a girl.,Dwight
What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. [Dwight has an epiphany],Dwight
What's going on with Pam?,Roy

"All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! Here we go. All right, big ticket item. [cheering] All right, in my pocket, I have... two tickets... to Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front... Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around?",Michael
Do you want us to look for 'em?,Stanley
"No. I think they were stolen. I think they were stolen and they're gone forever. So... oh, that was the last good item. So, good job, everybody.",Michael

"[driving, sighs, laughs] No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And [laughs] we are not that couple. [turns around]",Jim
"[whispering] Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It's sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not I had them- [Holly covers Michaels mouth]",Michael
"The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it's all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.",Holly
"[after accidentally seeing Michael and Holly kiss] No, I did not know that Michael was dating Holly.",David Wallace
"What can I do for you, Michael? I'm kinda busy.",Pam
"Oh, I guess that job that I got you is working out for you well, then.",Michael
It is. Thanks again.,Pam
"Hey, if there's anything else I can do, just let me know.",Michael
"[long pause] And of course, if there's ever anything I can ever do for you...",Pam
You know what? I would love a slice of real New York style pizza.,Michael
"If I get you a slice of pizza, are we even?",Pam
Even as pie.,Michael
"[opening a delivery envelope, takes out slice of pizza which appears to have a section off the end] Okay... don't ask me how I got it, let's just say that I have... connections. [folds it in two and takes a bite] Mmm. Mmm. [with a full mouth and an Italian accent] I'm the Godfather. I'm gonna eat this whole pizza. And then I'm gonna kill you. [digs around in envelope, pulls out the rest of the slice] [indistinct] some cheese. You gotta fold it up. That's the way you eat pizza.",Michael
I just don't know if he's presidential enough.,Jim
I know. And how long is CJ gonna spin this whole MS thing? How can Josh and Sam keep quiet?,Pam
"Every night, Jim and I watch an episode of The West Wing together on DVD. Um, he wanted to watch Battlestar Galactica and I wanted to watch Cranford... so we compromised. Next we're gonna watch Cranford.",Pam
Cranford? No. We will never watch that.,Jim
I am going to run three possible date ideas by you and I want you to tell me which one gets your blood percolating.,Michael
"Ah, I'm sure they're all great.",Jim
"I have two sure things, one wildcard.",Michael
Let's start with the wildcard.,Jim
Okay.,Michael
Mmm-hmm.,Jim
The wildcard is dinner at a nice restaurant.,Michael
Uh-oh.,Jim
"Exactly. Here, here are my sure things. I blindfold her. I take her to the Houdini Museum. She chains me up...",Michael
I think I got a pretty good sense of that one.,Jim
Okay.,Michael
Yep.,Jim
All right.,Michael
Let's move on to the next.,Jim
"Number two, we go to the mall...",Michael
Mmm-hmm.,Jim
"We go to the bed store, I let her choose whatever bed she wants...",Michael
"Oh, that's good.",Jim
And we have sex on it.,Michael
I like the wild card. I'm already liking the wild card.,Jim
"Really? I don't know. It's a big third date, Jim.",Michael
Mmm-hmm.,Jim
What do I do?,Michael
Have you asked her what she wants to do?,Jim
"Well, I thought as the man that I should make the decision.",Michael
No. You got that backwards.,Jim
"Times have changed, Jim.",Michael
"Our first date was at the Anthracite Coal Museum. We had both been before, but we pretended like it was our first time so we could get all the extra information. They knew we were faking... 'cause they recognized us. But we made them tell us all the stories. All the safety information. And we corrected them whenever they got it wrong. [Phyllis chuckles and nods, Dwight sighs and takes the rest of his sandwich out of the container and holds it up to Phyllis] You want half a sandwich?",Dwight
Okay.,Phyllis
"I'll bring you one tomorrow. You've earned it. [bites into the sandwich half, chews] Mmm. I hope you like fox meat.",Dwight
"[dressed as Carrie Bradshaw] Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.",Kelly
[dressed as Raggedy Ann] Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?,Phyllis
"Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.",Kelly
Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on],Phyllis
Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?,Kelly
Sure.,Phyllis
"I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.",Ryan
"Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?",Kelly
Gordon Gekko.,Ryan
"Oh, from the insurance commercials!",Kelly
... Yeah.,Ryan
[Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome.,Oscar
Let's put a smile on that face!,Creed

Cool.,Andy
You are? [Andy hisses] A cat?,Jim
[buzzer noise] We were looking for 'kitten.',Andy
"[phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.",Jim
Hey.,Pam
"Hey New York, Happy Halloween!",Jim
Thanks. My costume's getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin],Pam
"So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler.",Pam
"[dressed as the Joker] Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! [elevator doors close, reopen.] Disappear.",Dwight
"Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat's Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets.",Michael
"Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours.",Holly
"When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire.",Michael
Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.,Holly
Road trip! Right?,Michael
"Breaker one-nine, copy?",Holly
"Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.",Michael
Hey! Do Not Touch My Radio.,Darryl
We're not.,Michael
Kidding.,Holly
We're not doing anything.,Michael
"It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said 'Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?' And he said 'I asked you first.' And I said 'First!' at the same time he did. And then I said 'Jinx.' And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So...",Holly
"All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge.",Michael
"Oh, I'll walk you out.",Jim
"Ah, you are quite the gentleman.",Michael
You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.,Michael
All right. We'll see. [to camera] No.,Jim
"I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.",Jim
Good morning temp.,Dwight
Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight.,Ryan
Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning. Hello. How are you Phyllis?,Dwight
Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off! Hey buddy.,Andy
Andy.,Dwight
"Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.",Andy
"No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!",Dwight
"Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?",Andy
"Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.",Dwight
I'm sitting right here Dwight.,Phyllis
"I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.",Dwight
"Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug]",Dwight
I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!,Holly
Cool!,Michael
Mike you'll drive this every weekend?,Darryl
"We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.",Michael
"Life is a highway, I want to ride it all night long.",Michael and Holly
"If you're going my way, I wanna drive you all night long! If you're going my way...","Michael, Holly, and Darryl"
"Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong.",Dwight
"Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying 'we.' You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me.",Andy
"Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.",Dwight
"I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.",Andy
"Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.",Dwight
Hey!,Pam
"Hey, future baby sis!",Tom
How are you Tom. Nice to see you.,Pam
I'm good.,Tom
"I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, 'That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best.'",Pam
"Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.",Pam
That's perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend?,Pete
"Right! That would be hilarious! We should totally dog her, about being an artist, never making any money!",Tom
"That, is awesome!",Pete
"Like she basically has a hobby, for a job.",Tom
Oh yeah.,Pete
"So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?",Pam
I think this is better.,Pete
The other thing would 'get' Jim.,Tom
"This is nicer, it's fun. It's fun!",Pete
"Okay, okay.",Pam
"Oh, he hates it when we pick on his girlfriends.",Tom
Oookay....,Pam
They came up with that idea really fast.,Pam
This trip was longer than I thought.,Darryl
Yeah it did look shorter on the map-,Holly
Ah! Ah! Ahhhh! [waking up] Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.,Michael
You were sleeping? You were talking before.,Holly
Was I? Really? Was I saying anything interesting?,Michael
Not really.,Darryl
"All right. What's the scoop, how far?",Michael
Four hours. Almost halfway there.,Darryl
We're only halfway?,Holly
"Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.",Michael
Next exit isn't for five miles.,Darryl
Let's check there.,Holly
Hey guys.,Pam
"Hey, how are you?",Jim
Hi! [smooches],Pam
Good to see you.,Jim
"Nice to see you again, Pam.",Pete
"Pam, I haven't seen you in so, so long!",Tom
All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.,Jim
There's nothing out here man.,Darryl
"Yeah. I don't know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.",Michael
"Here we go, fourth time's a charm. 'Life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you don't, sometimes you do, what you want... there's a world out there.... [Holly sobs] Hey. Are you crying?",Michael
No.,Holly
Allergies?,Michael
No.,Holly
Did Darryl touch you?,Michael
WHAT!?,Darryl
"No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? [crying]",Holly
What's the matter?,Michael
It's not gonna work.,Holly
Sure it is.,Michael
There's too much distance.,Holly
"Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine.",Michael
Michael we've only been dating each other for a few weeks,Holly
Listen to me. I like you so much.,Michael
And I like you too.,Holly
And I've dated four women in the last--,Michael
I've dated four guys last year too.,Holly
Not last - no. In like the last ten years.,Michael
Oh.,Holly
"I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.",Michael
Michael. Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be.,Holly
That's what she said.,Michael
"Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.",Michael
Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling],Andy
Excuse me?,Dwight
Take. That down.,Andy
You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.,Meredith
I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.,Andy
It's pronounced Ker-nell. It's the highest rank in the military.,Creed
It's pronounced 'Corn-ell!' It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!,Andy
"Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.",Dwight
Fine.,Andy
What do you say?,Dwight
"Yeah, good. Can we--- [Dwight pulls out Cornell mascot bobble-head] Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!!",Andy
"If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at... midnight? At best?",Holly
Yeah.,Michael
And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.,Holly
"Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way.",Michael
Oh.,Holly
"I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road.",Michael
Well-,Holly
Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend?,Michael
How long could we keep that up?,Holly
Years!,Michael
Years?,Holly
Yeah.,Michael
Years? Of just a few hours every weekend?,Holly
"Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.",Michael
[kisses his temple] Thank you.,Holly
"My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy.",Michael
"Clever, Mike.",Darryl
"So Pam, how much does an artist make after they leave art school?",Tom
"Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?",Pete
That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.,Jim
Maybe Pam should pay the check by drawing a picture on this napkin.,Tom
"Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?",Jim
"Hey, just having fun Jimmy.",Pete
Yeah. Right Pam?,Tom
Yup! [Tom and Pete give Halpertian looks to camera],Pam
"You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well. We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think?",Michael
"I do, I think so.",Holly
Then don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this. [they continue arguing],Michael
"[leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.",Darryl
I don't know what I'm gonna do!,Michael
Please call me back.,Darryl
Please?,Michael
You'll be okay,Holly
I'm not gonna be okay.,Michael
Please...,Darryl
You will.,Holly
"No I won't! I'm not strong! And I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!",Michael
[outside men's room] You might be interested- [stops when he sees Stanley come out],Andy
What?,Stanley
Dwight!,Andy
"Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?",Dwight
"Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.",Andy
That's a conflict of interest.,Dwight
"Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?",Andy
[thinks] Interview.,Dwight
"Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.",Andy
What?,Dwight
The conference room!,Andy
Okay.,Dwight
Who are your role models?,Andy
"If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.",Andy
"So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great.",Andy
"Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her.",Jim
Cute.,Pam
That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?,Jim
Yup. She only knows how to play 'When the Saints go Marching In.',Tom
Love that one.,Jim
"Yeah but, she doesn't think she's gonna be like, career musician right?",Pete
Here you go again! What is your deal today?,Jim
Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides... Louis Armstrong?,Pete
Miles Davis.,Pam
One.,Jim
Chet ...something.,Pam
Half.,Jim
"The point is Pam, is there are jobs-",Pete
Dizzy Gillespie.,Pam
Also good.,Jim
"And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don't see me try to get on the Mets.",Pete
You don't!,Tom
Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?,Jim
I'm just calling it like I see it.,Pete
I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art.,Pam
"Pam, don't worry about it.",Jim
"I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So...",Pam
"Guys, what is going on?! [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]",Jim
We pranked you!,Tom
It was Pam's idea. Pam was the mastermind.,Pete
... Got you.,Pam
That was killer. I was so close to blowing it.,Pete
Let's see how well you know your Big Red history.,Andy
Bring it.,Dwight
Who was Cornell's eighth president?,Andy
Dale Raymond Corson!,Dwight
"Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. [writes in a notebook] Comprehension skills, sub-par.",Andy
"Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook]",Dwight
What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention?,Andy
"On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.",Dwight
"Nobody wants ...that, to happen.",Andy
"Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested.",Dwight
"Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character.'",Andy
Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process.',Dwight
Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations.',Andy
Interviewer has suspect motives.',Dwight
Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid.',Andy
"Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth.' Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.",Dwight
I have everything I need- [talking over each other],Andy
And you will be hearing from the -,Dwight
And you will be hearing from -,Andy
"-Cornell Application Department,",Dwight
which I will not be a part of-,Andy
And you will not be pleased with the result. [pulls table away from Andy],Dwight
And YOU will not be pleased with the result!,Andy
And your affiliation with Cornell -,Dwight
And your affiliation with Cornell -,Andy
Will end completely!,Dwight
Will end completely!,Andy
"[has won the table war] That is all sir, you may go.",Dwight
"[Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.",Darryl
"For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.",Pam
"Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?",Jim
"Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle.",Pam
That is good.,Jim
Thank you.,Pam
"Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. 'Pam cool. Welcome to the family.'",Jim
Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?,Pam
This is the last of it.,Darryl
"Oh that's mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck.",Michael
You're not staying?,Darryl
"You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I'll just ride back with you.",Michael
But you want me to put it back in the truck.,Darryl
I'll be down in just a second. [into house] Holly?,Michael
So um... I think I'm gonna go back with Darryl [Holly hugs Michael] Okay. [they kiss goodbye.] Goodbye.,Michael
Okay. Bye.,Holly
I know it's hard Mike. Break-ups hurt.,Darryl
We didn't break up.,Michael
"Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues.",Darryl
Okay.,Michael
[bluesy] Da na na na na... da na na na na...,Darryl
That's a really pretty song.,Michael
"Da na na na na. No, no, check it out, look. Da na na na na... want to do that?",Darryl
Okay.,Michael

I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.,Dwight
"Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm. [attempts to bite into a raw beet, beet is too hard] You're supposed to cook these, aren't you?",Andy

"Well, I'll be around.",Holly
[chuckling] Isn't it a seven-hour drive?,Oscar
"It's not that bad. But if I'm really jonesing to see you guys, I can always fly.",Holly
"I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly. [Holly gasps] You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because....",Oscar
"[interrupting Oscar] Well, I just want to say goodbye. [hugs Oscar]",Holly
Okay.,Oscar
Okay.,Holly
Bye.,Oscar
"Well, Hol, this is it.",Kevin
"Yeah, okay. [extends hand to Kevin]",Holly
"[outstretches arms for a hug, Holly reluctantly complies]",Kevin
"[whispers in Holly's ear, Holly reacts with horrified look]",Kevin
"[pushing Kevin away] Um, yeah, that's not gonna happen.",Holly
"Yeah, but you have to admit it would be wild.",Kevin
"So, you're dumping Michael? Smart.",Kelly
"No, we're gonna do the long-distance thing.",Holly
Oh! You guys are gonna keep dating? That's so romantic!,Kelly
"Yeah, thanks.",Holly
"I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we're in the same building.",Phyllis
"Oh, well....look, we could always call, or email, or write. I should get all your email addresses.",Holly
"Yes, we'll email you, and then you'll have our addresses.",Angela
[talking head] It's a little sad. Michael and I just started dating. He wants me to stay and get a job around here as a baker. Or a baker's helper.,Holly
"[talking head] This is gonna be awesome. This is gonna be awesome. I've decided that on my drives to Nashua, I am going to learn French, the language of love. And on my drives back, I am going to learn Spanish; what the cleaning crew speaks.",Michael
[talking head] I'm driving them up for five times what I would've made at work. I thought I made a good deal. [expression changes from smiling to downcast] Then I realized I'm gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day.,Darryl
"[playing cat's cradle with Holly] Okay, am I grabbing this one?",Michael
"[chuckling] No, that's not what you're grabbing.",Holly
[laughs],Michael
Put....okay....,Holly
"[driving truck] Hey, y'all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way.",Darryl
"Sorry, Darryl.",Holly
"It's like Driving Miss Daisy, you know?",Darryl
All right.,Holly
You gotta include me in the conversation.,Darryl
Fair enough.,Michael
If you don't mind.,Darryl
"Okay, okay. What kind of car games did you play in the 'hood?",Michael
I got a game. Cow surfing.,Darryl
Cow surfing?,Michael
"Spot a cow, last person to say 'Jackson Five' has to get on its back and ride it.",Darryl
Really?,Michael
Were there even cows where you grew up?,Holly
Everybody got a government cow.,Darryl
"Cow surfing. [spots a cow out the window] Okay, here we go, there's a cow.",Michael
[in unison] Jackson Five!,Holly & Darryl
"Oh, shoot! Okay. All right. All right. [throws up hands] Pull it over. Here we go.",Michael
"Here we go. Go get him, Mike!",Darryl
[reaching to open door] I'm gonna do it.,Michael
"[grabs Michael's arm] No, Michael. It's not a real game.",Holly
Then why did you say 'Jackson Five?',Darryl
The man has a point.,Michael
Darryl....,Holly
"All right, I made it up.",Darryl
[visibly shocked] What? Why?,Michael
Because I wanted you to like me.,Darryl
"[gasps] I do! Hey, come on!",Michael
[trying not to laugh] Okay.,Darryl
Jackson Five.,Michael
"[both laugh hysterically at portable DVD player on dashboard while Darryl drives, looking miserable]",Holly & Michael
"[makes sudden sharp turn to the left, causing DVD player to fall out open window, then grins to camera]",Darryl
[rubbing noses with Holly] You're the one.,Michael
"No, you.",Holly
You are.,Michael
You are.,Holly
"No, you are.",Michael
You are more.,Holly
[rubs face in exasperation],Darryl
You're the best.,Michael
You're better.,Holly
You're better. You're better than my best.,Michael
You're better than betterest.,Holly
[plants kisses all over Michael's face],Holly
Here we go.,Michael
Hold your breath!,Holly
"Okay, Ready?",Michael
[setting stopwatch] Go.,Darryl
[both inhale deeply and lock lips while holding their breath],Michael & Holly
[looks to camera for several seconds] At least it's quiet.,Darryl
"Watch this. Darryl, watch this.",Michael
"Look, Darryl, lip up.",Holly
[kiss each other while puffing their cheeks and mumbling],Michael & Holly
"Down, and give me 50!",Holly
"[in unison while kissing with mouths closed] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!",Michael & Holly
"Hey, you know what would be fun? Like, sleeping.",Darryl
Yeah,Michael
You know.,Darryl
"[hugging Michael] Oh, snuggles!",Holly
"Yeah. Right, snuggle time.",Michael
Snuggles.,Holly
There you go.,Darryl
[makes squeaking sounds],Michael
Spooning.,Holly
"Here's what I was thinking. The following weekend, I drive up.",Michael
Mmm hmm.,Holly
"We get right in the car, we pop up to Montreal. It's like another seven hours.",Michael
Ooh!,Holly
Speak.,Michael
We could stay in a cozy B&B with a fireplace?,Holly
"Absolutely. Oh, and you know what, Darryl? You are invited to go as well.",Michael
"Oh, thanks. Thanks. No.",Darryl
"Come on, it'll be fun.",Michael
Thank you. Thank you. No.,Darryl
"[emerging from convenience store with two ice cream sundaes] Hey, look at that. Fun, right?",Michael
Mmm.,Holly
"Mmm mmm! Remember the 15-scooper we had last week? Wasn't that good? I was Scooperman, you were Scoopy-Doo. Remember what you said? You were laughing.",Michael
Yeah.,Holly
Say what you said.,Michael
"No, Michael. I don't....[mimicking Scooby-Doo] I'm gonna puke!",Holly
[laughs] I'll save you! I'm Superman! Scooperman!,Michael
Darryl didn't want any?,Holly
I didn't ask.,Michael
We want the same things.,Michael
"I know, but from seven hours away.",Holly
That is a lucky number. Seven. 7-Up. Seven dwarfs.,Michael
Michael....,Holly
Seven deadly sins. It's a sign.,Michael
"Hey, y'all wanna hear some loud music or something?",Darryl
I'm an atheist. Did you know that? I don't know your religion. There are so many conversations that we haven't even had yet.,Holly
"Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That's crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states?",Darryl
"[standing with Holly next to 'Welcome to New Hampshire' sign] Oh, it's really cold here.",Michael
"Oh, it's just later.",Holly
Yeah.,Michael
[holding camera] Here we go.,Darryl
[starts to cry] Can we have another? I think I blinked.,Michael
[unlocking front door] This is me here.,Holly
"Oh, you have your own entrance. That's nice.",Michael
"Stairs. Oh, man....",Darryl
He's just trying to push your buttons.,Angela
"I don't care, so it doesn't matter.",Andy
"Great, then it doesn't matter.",Angela
"You don't think he could get in, though....right? I mean, I don't care, but I just don't see how he could. I doubt he could get in.",Andy
[reverently] He is fiercely intelligent.,Angela
"I don't care either way, so....shut up.",Andy
He's just....,Angela
"[in parking lot on cell phone] Don't tell me to calm down, Dad! [grunts] Don't do that! Oh, God, of all people, I thought you would understand. You're an alum. This guy, he's....he's poking the bear! [listens briefly] Yeah, okay, I'll see you at Thanksgiving. Hi to Mom. Bye.",Andy
Why are you doing this to Andy?,Angela
"You once told me that Andy and I had different strengths. Well, he can't do what I can do. I can get into Cornell, but he doesn't know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever.",Dwight
"[looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy.",Angela
"No, but it'll make you respect him less.",Dwight
"[sighs] Yes, that's true.",Angela
"Hey, sport.",Michael
"I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh? [punches Michael's shoulder]",Dwight
Ow! God!,Michael
"Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!",Dwight
"I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.",Darryl
"Big idea: double wedding. Me, Angela, you, Holly.",Andy
"No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam.",Michael
"Yeah, we'd never do that.",Jim
"Yeah, so there you go.",Michael
"[enters Michael's office] Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.",Kelly
"Oh, wow, so quickly.",Michael
"Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.",Kelly
"Michael, did you tell your mom yet?",Kevin
Nope. Nope. Not yet.,Michael
You wouldn't tell your mom?,Jim
You love your mom.,Kevin
"Call your mom, Michael. [everyone talking]",Kelly
I'll call her later.,Michael
[chanting and clapping] Call her! Call her!,Group
I don't want to do that. [chanting continues] All right. [picks up phone and dials] She is going to freak out!,Michael
[punches button] Speakerphone!,Andy
That's -- thanks.,Michael
[on speakerphone] Hello?,Mother
"Mom, I'm getting married.",Michael
"No, you're not.",Mother
"Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me.",Michael
"Well, are you getting married?",Mother
No. [laughs],Michael
Are you-- [Michael ends call],Mother
"I'm not, I'm not getting married. So... [laughs] Psych.",Michael
"So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100.",Kelly
And I'm out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?,Michael
"Yeah, uh, this is all of them: Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and -- oh. Oh, it's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What's that doing there? [hands stack of papers to Michael]",Kelly
I'll take care of that for you. [crumples receipt and throws it in trash] Thanks.,Michael
"Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor's List. 'Schindler's List' parody. ... That's not appropriate, no.",Michael
"Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger.",Jim
"[on Bluetooth speaker] Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work.",Pam
Aww.,Jim
"It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something.",Pam
"[on Bluetooth] Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.",Jim
"We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone.",Pam
"Uh, Pam. What do you want on your coffee?",Alex
Sprinkle of cinnamon.,Jim and Pam
I should go.,Pam
"Alrighty, Dwighty, let's see how you did.",Michael
Bring it on. [starts to put foot up on Michael's desk],Dwight
No.,Michael
Sorry.,Dwight
Wow.,Michael
What does it say?,Dwight
"Dwight, your feedback is horrible.",Michael
That's impossible.,Dwight
A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.,Michael
I sell more paper than anyone. [stands and reaches for the file],Dwight
"No, no, no, no, no.",Michael
"Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.",Dwight
Do I look like I am joking?,Michael
"No, but that's sometimes part of it.",Dwight
"If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?",Michael
Impossible to say. I can't see myself.,Dwight
You're not.,Michael
"Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet?",Andy
Nope.,Jim
I got mine. They were really good.,Andy
[listening in New York] I miss him.,Pam
You must be really proud.,Jim
"Yeah, pretty psyched. Whoa! That's my mug.",Andy
"Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.",Jim
"Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one.",Andy
"OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use [finds a mug] uh, oh -- Snoopy.",Jim
Don't give him Snoopy. That's mine.,Pam
[smiles] It is a great mug. But it's not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back.,Andy
How can you even be sure?,Jim
It has my face on it.,Andy
"[holds mug next to Andy's head] Make the face. [Andy smiles] Yeah, I don't see it.",Jim
"Dude, that is my face!",Andy
[Dwight slams something on desk] What was that?,Pam
Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.,Jim
Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?,Pam
"It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.",Jim
What are you mumbling about?,Dwight
How was your meeting with Michael?,Jim
None of your business.,Dwight
Was it your scores?,Jim
"Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --",Dwight
Mm-hmm.,Jim
I'm being sabotaged.,Dwight
Of course.,Jim
And I'm going to find that person and punish them.,Dwight
Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.,Jim
You're an idiot.,Dwight
There's the charm.,Jim
"Jimbo, let's do this thang.",Michael
That is me. Wish me luck.,Jim
No way.,Dwight
[whispers on bluetooth] Good luck.,Pam
Thanks.,Jim
I didn't say anything,Dwight
I love you.,Pam
"I love you, too.",Jim
What do you think I am saying to you?!,Dwight
I'm not talking to you.,Jim
"I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser.",Dwight
"[on phone] Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's really gorgeous. You guys do great work.",Andy
I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani's first and third weddings. And I got him. [shakes fist] I got him!,Andy
"[on phone] Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous.",Andy
"Oh, come on.",Michael
What?,Jim
You too?,Michael
Did my scores drop a little?,Jim
"Jim, they are a poopy. [Jim coughs, presses button to end call on Bluetooth]",Michael
[touches ear] Jim? Jim?,Pam
Are we even sure that's my file?,Jim
"No. [glances at it] Yes, I am sure, Jim. It --",Michael
"Well, there's got to be an explanation.",Jim
I agree.,Michael
Yeah.,Jim
So let's see what we can find out from reading. [reads] Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant.,Michael
I think you mean smug,Jim
[points at Jim] Arrogance.,Michael
"Michael, I'm just trying to --",Jim
And there's our smudgeness.,Michael
"I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. [taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.",Jim
Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.,Pam
A little bit. ... Worth it.,Jim
"Here's what's going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called?",Michael
Microgement.,Jim
"Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go.",Michael
"All right, fine. [picks up phone] Brrring.",Dwight
[picks up phone] Hello?,Jim
"Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.",Dwight
"Wow, that's great, because I need paper.",Jim
"Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.",Dwight
"Wow, this is my lucky day.",Jim
[whispers] Ask him his name.,Michael
"What is your name, sir?",Dwight
I am Bill Buttlicker.,Jim
"Really, that's your real name?",Dwight
"How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.",Jim
"Be respectful, Dwight.",Michael
"Yes, Michael.",Dwight
Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.,Jim
"What? No, but I --",Dwight
"Hello? [laughs] No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. [punches button on phone]",Jim
It's up to you to change his mind.,Michael
Sorry. That was a family emergency.,Jim
"Oh, no. What's wrong?",Dwight
You know what? That's private.,Jim
"Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!",Michael
"Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--",Dwight
"Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.",Jim
He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go.,Michael
"OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --",Dwight
You're gonna have to talk louder.,Jim
"OK, our prices have never been lower.",Dwight
"Son, you have to talk louder.",Jim
...never been lower!,Dwight
"Louder, son!",Jim
[shouting] Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!,Dwight
Stop it! Stop it!,Michael
He --,Dwight
That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.,Michael
"Now, you listen to me, sir.",Jim
Here we go.,Michael
"The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.",Jim
Give me the phone.,Michael
"Please, Mr. Buttlicker --",Dwight
I'm irate right now.,Jim
Give me the phone.,Michael
Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.,Dwight
Give me the phone. Give me the phone.,Michael
I have to put you on with my boss.,Dwight
"Well, I should hope so. [Michael takes phone] Who is this?",Jim
"Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager.",Michael
"Well, this is William M. Buttlicker.",Jim
"Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you?",Michael
"Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.",Jim
"[shakes fist, whispers] Yeah!",Dwight
"[covers phone, whispers to Dwight] See how it's done? [into phone] Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it. [to Dwight] See what I did?",Michael
You are the master.,Dwight
"There is one condition, Michael.",Jim
Yes.,Michael
You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.,Jim
"Don't do it, Michael.",Dwight
... [whispers] It's a million-dollar sale.,Michael
"So it's called the Shangri-La Tent. It's two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple, really tasteful.",Andy
I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo,Angela
Hobos live in trains.,Andy
Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long.,Angela
"Well, Nana Mim -- Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And it's in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now.",Andy
"OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field",Angela
Done and done-er.,Andy
There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.,Angela
Do you have a specific place in mind?,Andy
No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.,Angela
On it!,Andy
Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight's car comes screeching into view],Jim
Get in!,Dwight
Are you serious?,Jim
Get in! [he peels off into parking space],Dwight
"OK, what are you --",Jim
"Shh. [turns radio up loud, playing 'Centerfold.'] They might be listening to us.",Dwight
What's that?,Jim
They might be listening to us,Dwight
Who's they?,Jim
Customer service might be monitoring this conversation.,Dwight
In this car?,Jim
You never know. Better safe than sorry.,Dwight
[turns radio down] What are you thinking?,Jim
Who stands to benefit from our downfall?,Dwight
"The mob, maybe NASA.",Jim
"Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that.",Dwight
Is there some evidence?,Jim
"[on Bluetooth] Ooh, cute shoes online.",Pam
How many shoes do you need?,Jim
"I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?",Dwight
I'm not talking to you.,Jim
Who are you talking to?,Dwight
Pam.,Jim
"She's not here, Jim.",Dwight
"No, she's not.",Jim
"[in New York, humming to herself to the tune of 'Centerfold'] Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.",Pam
"[at computer, spins chair around and makes triumphant gesture] Yes!",Andy
"I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. Oh, yeah. We work together. It's Dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms.",Andy
"[on phone] So I'd like to redouble my order, if you could put me down for, um --",Customer
"Wait, shut up.",Dwight
I'm sorry?,Customer
Shh. Do you hear that?,Dwight
Hear what?,Customer
Breathing. Is that you?,Dwight
"Well, I am breathing, yes.",Customer
"Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. [puts down phone and runs away]",Dwight
I need paper.,Customer
[jumps into Kelly's area] Ha! [Kelly screams in surprise],Dwight
"Oh, my God. You scared me.",Kelly
Hear anything interesting?,Dwight
What are you talking about?,Kelly
[laughs] I think you know.,Dwight
"You always say that, and I almost never know.",Kelly
"What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?",Dwight
Are you accusing me of something?,Kelly
"Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself.",Dwight
[behind Dwight]: OK.,Jim
[surprised] Ah!,Dwight
Easy.,Jim
OK.,Dwight
Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.,Jim
"You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews.",Kelly
"The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved.",Dwight
"Dwight, get out of my nook!",Kelly
[in New York] That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said!,Pam
Good one.,Jim
"[enters breakroom] Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.",Jim
"Yeah, he's weird.",Kelly
"Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...",Jim
OK.,Kelly
"Hey, how are you and Darryl?",Jim
"Um, we're cool. [gets up to leave] Bye.",Kelly
Bye.,Jim
[on Bluetooth] That was weird.,Pam
What was?,Jim
Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?,Pam
"No, actually.",Jim
Did you do something to her?,Pam
I don't think so.,Jim
"Well, something's off.",Pam
"Hey, how's things?",Jim
All right.,Ryan
Yeah?,Jim
Living in the moment.,Ryan
Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?,Jim
"I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?",Ryan
"Wait, that's pretty weird.",Jim
What?,Ryan
"Well, Andy has a mug just like that.",Jim
"Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.",Ryan
No. What party?,Jim
Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.,Ryan
I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?,Jim
"Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.",Pam
"Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- [sees mugs on Angela's and Meredith's desks]",Jim
"[walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis]",Jim
"Dwight, let me see your coffee cup.",Jim
No. [holds Sheriff's Department mug protectively],Dwight
Is that it?,Jim
No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut],Dwight
"OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.",Jim
"Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?",Dwight
Probably just Kelly.,Jim
Obviously. I knew it.,Dwight
That's what I'm saying.,Jim
Yeah. What?,Dwight
You were right.,Jim
I was -- I was right.,Dwight
You were right.,Jim
I was right.,Dwight
You knew it.,Jim
I knew it.,Dwight
"You knew it the whole time, buddy.",Jim
"I knew it the whole time, buddy! [shoves Jim]",Dwight
Wow.,Jim
Yeah! Woo-hoo!,Dwight
[in New York] Right Dwight is loud.,Pam
I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis' head; she ducks] Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her.,Dwight
"No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.",Jim
What's going on?,Kelly
Why don't you tell us?,Michael
Nothing's going on.,Kelly
"Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.",Dwight
Dwight. [to Kelly] I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.,Michael
What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.,Kelly
"Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.",Dwight
"We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.",Jim
What's going on?,Michael
"I love your tie, Michael.",Kelly
"[looks momentarily flattered, but thinks better of it] Kelly.",Michael
I was raped.,Kelly
"You cannot say 'I was raped' and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened.",Michael
"OK, all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends.",Kelly
We have our confession. I'm calling security. [reaches for phone],Dwight
"Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.",Michael
See? I wasn't lying.,Kelly
You were lying.,Michael
I was lying.,Kelly
"Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us.",Michael
I want to be here when you fire her ass.,Dwight
I will call you when it is time. [Jim and Dwight leave],Michael
"I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?",Michael
No problem.,Kelly
"I think you should do that. [Kelly starts fake-crying, then laughing, then she and Michael both laugh]",Michael
Pam Beesley?,Alex
"Hey, what are you doing here?",Pam
Who's that?,Jim
It's Alex.,Pam
"It's Pam. Uh, I came to kidnap you. There's free wine and cheese at the Chuck Close retrospective. Let's go.",Alex
"Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?",Jim
"Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work.",Pam
"Uh, well, actually there's something else I'd love to talk to you about. Can we go somewhere else to talk about it?",Alex
OK.,Pam
That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.,Jim
[in private office] Um.,Alex
What's up?,Pam
I'm gonna take a big leap and I want to tell you that I think you should not move back to Scranton.,Alex
Wow.,Pam
I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.,Jim
Why did you come to New York in the first place?,Alex
"Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.",Pam
"Right. And that's why I think that you should stay here. Because I mean, you -- really you just got here, you know? You can't do New York in three months. You know, it has everything. It has -- all the opportunity is here. All the -- the whole art scene is in New York. You know, it would be nuts to go back to Scranton without getting to fully experience it.",Alex
Jim's in Scranton.,Pam
"I know. But all I'm saying is, if there's even a teeny, tiny part of you that really wants to be an artist, then I think you should stay here, because you don't want to wake up in 50 years and look back and wonder what could have been. And that is the end of my speech. I planned it all. Anyway ... I will see you tomorrow.",Alex
I'll see you tomorrow.,Pam
OK. [Pam and Jim look worried],Alex
Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? [reaches toward Jim's ear] May I?,Dwight
Don't.,Jim
Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.,Dwight
"We haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers.",Andy
"Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials? [opens album]",Dwight
Oh. Hmm.,Andy
"[looking at Angela] While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. [Angela smiles] I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. [Andy moves his head into Dwight's view] Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night.",Dwight
That's very generous.,Andy
"While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.",Dwight
"Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal! [shakes Dwight's hand]",Andy
OK.,Dwight
"Um, what are we talking price wise?",Andy
You already said deal.,Dwight
Pay him whatever he wants.,Angela
Can't argue with that. Dwight ... [takes Angela's hand] You are going to make us so happy. [Dwight and Angela grin at each other],Andy
"Come on, how did you propose? Spill it. Were you wasted?",Meredith
"How did I propose, let me see... well, I drove her up to Nashua, and I had the ring, a big 10-carat diamond; it was beautiful. And I got down on my hands and knees, and a shooting star crossed overhead, and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star. And we were in a restaurant, and I put the diamond into a cheeseburger.",Michael
Ooooh.,Kevin & Andy
"And she took a bite, started to choke. So what do I do? I have CPR training. Go around, start doing the Heimlich.",Michael
Perfect.,Jim
"The ring, 10-carat diamond, pops out of her mouth, hits her shrimp cocktail, right onto her finger. Million-to-one shot. All of the Greek people in the restaurant start screaming 'Opa!' Which means 'congratulations,' so...",Michael
"Oh, man!",Andy
[in Jim's ear] Ask how he's doing since the breakup.,Pam
"So, how you holdin' up?",Jim
I'm pretty much devastated.,Michael
Ask if there's anything you can do.,Pam
You know what you should do? Take a vacation.,Jim
"Maybe go to Sandals, Jamaica. Or the other Sandals, Jamaica. I just don't want to go by myself.",Michael
Tell him you'd like to go with him.,Pam
We should take a look at those surveys.,Jim
"Why are surveys important? Okay, hypothetical: A man wants to buy 500 reams of....carrots. And, so he's like 'What do I do? Where do I go? Do I go to the insensitive carrot supplier, the insensitive carrot salesman? Or do I go to the nice carrot salesman, who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot, but guarantee next-day delivery on your carrots? Most companies need their carrots the next day. Now, substitute paper for carrots, and that is why surveys are important.'",Michael
"Great marks, Phyllis. [Phyllis walks out of Michael's office smiling]",Michael
"[to Stanley] Hey, I did good too!",Phyllis
I knew it. Haha! [they high five],Stanley
"[hand up, seeking a high five] Up! Don't leave me hangin'! [they do]",Andy
"What do I do with my bonus check? [scoffs] Simple. Purchase paper from myself. Boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus. Last year I bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger. Eventually, I'll get a bonus so big I can retire on it. And I'll use the paper to write my memoirs.",Dwight
"I taught Jim and Dwight everything I know about sales. But there are certain things that cannot be taught, and it is these things that I now must teach them.",Michael
"Attention, all problem sales persons. Jim Halpert... Dwight Schrute...",Michael
[raises hand] Here.,Dwight
Intensive one-on-one retraining will begin after lunch. That is all.,Michael
"I am no longer the worst salesman in the office. Yes! [Andy gestures excitedly, knocking over his coffee mug] Ow! Dammit!",Andy
"Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles.",Jim
"My job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper. In return, they give me money. I am the predator and they are the prey. Would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk? Should the hawk even care? [sighs heavily, nearly starts to cry] Excuse me, I've got work to do.",Dwight
[laughs heartily and passes a newspaper to Phyllis],Stanley
[laughing] It's good!,Phyllis
"Hey, what are you laughing at?",Dwight
[continue to laugh],Stanley & Phyllis
Are you laughing at me?,Dwight
We're laughing at this cartoon! [passes newspaper to Dwight],Phyllis
"Perfect, isn't it?",Stanley
[looks at cartoon] How is that funny? What are you really laughing at? Huh?,Dwight
Haven't you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.,Phyllis
[laughing louder] And he really nailed them on it. Somebody's finally holding them accountable!,Stanley
[looking at cartoon] There's no way you're laughing at this.,Dwight
"[peering nervously through conference room window] Oh, I don't have anything to say. I'm just hiding from Dwight.",Jim
[is seen taking apart his phone receiver to check for listening devices],Dwight
"It's good to be paranoid. People need to be more paranoid. Case in point, JFK. If I had been JFK, I would have seen all three gunmen. I would have pulled out my concealed Luger and fired first. Man in book depository, BOOM! Grassy knoll, BOOM! Fake Jackie, BOOM! [pretends to kiss, then shoot imaginary person to his left] Then I shoot myself, so I don't change history and create a paradox. BOOM! But right at the last minute, [contorts head sideways] I twist out of the way of the bullet. Nice try, history. Better luck next year.",Dwight
"So, as it turns out, Dwight is right. How bizarre.",Jim
[in Jim's ear] I wonder what else Dwight's been right about....,Pam
Major pharmaceuticals do not want you to know that beet juice has medicinal value both as an aphrodisiac and a laxative.,Dwight
The Scranton Zoning Board has a strong bias against beet farmers. The mayor is in the pocket of Big Lettuce.,Dwight
Battlestar Galactica isn't a documentary exactly.,Dwight
"The book All The President's Men is about a conspiracy, just not the one people think.",Dwight
"Jesus had a daughter, and she was the Mona Lisa.",Dwight
"What we have come to know as fake crab meat is in fact real crab meat, and real crab meat is lobster.",Dwight
Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time? In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment. In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom. This is considered to be polite.,Michael
Why are you telling us this?,Jim
I am jetting off on an international business trip.,Michael
Where are you going?,Jim
To Can-A-da.,Michael
Where is it?,Jim
Canada.,Michael
Okay.,Jim
"My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international. The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery...",Michael
"Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi.",Michael
[British accent] Hello.,Meredith
I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket. [covers Meredith's face with his jacket] You are now sexy in your culture.,Michael
T minus...,Kevin
Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back],Jim
[walks up behind Jim and puts his hands on his shoulders] One more week.,Creed
Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.,Jim
On more week. [chuckles],Phyllis
Heh heh. [Jim gives camera an odd look],Stanley
[on speakerphone] Do you have your passport?,David Wallace
I have my passport. [pats jacket pocket],Michael
Got your per diem?,David Wallace
I have my per diem. [holds up money] I already know what I am going to spend this on. I am going to buy a sweater.,Michael
"Michael, the... that's for your food.",David Wallace
Well I'll just... I'll use different money for that.,Michael
I was happy to send Michael on this trip. He's been feeling pretty down since we had to transfer Holly up to New Hampshire. But this little perk really seemed to turn him around. [chuckling] And it's pretty tough to find somebody who wants to go up to Winnipeg mid-November.,David Wallace
"And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best. Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine. I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.",Michael
"Well, I'm just glad to know you're happy because you know I felt bad.",David Wallace
Well that is all in the past.,Michael
"And in terms of nightlife, when you get there just ask the concierge.",David Wallace
They have one of those?,Michael
[in a singsong voice] Lets do this!,Michael
"Wait, why do you need three suitcases?",Dwight
Two are for souvenirs.,Michael
Do you have your money belt?,Dwight
I do. It's right here. [indicates to waist],Michael
"No, no, no, no, no. You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. [demonstrates]",Dwight
"No, I don't want to wear a bra.",Michael
"Here, let me help you. [reaches for Michael's money belt]",Dwight
Stop it! Stop it!,Michael
Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.,Dwight
Okay. Where is my translator?,Michael
Monsieur.,Andy
There he is.,Michael
I'm just bidding a bon voyage a La Mon Petit fiancee. Translation: Goodbye my petite fiancee. [chuckles],Andy
Be good.,Angela
I will try.,Andy
Meaning what?,Angela
Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid.,Andy
Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you [points at Jim] if you hadn't forgotten French. Where is my numbers man?,Michael
Here.,Oscar
There we go. Our town car awaits.,Michael
It's just a van.,Meredith
Its not just a van.,Michael
"Look, I know my way around a van. That is just a van.",Meredith
"Dwight, can you get those please?",Michael
[sighs and picks up Michael's empty suitcases],Dwight
[on airplane] Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa.,Michael
Ah... sweet!,Andy
Handed to me as I sat down. This was my hot towel. It is still wet.,Michael
Michael Gary Scott rolling like a pimp!,Andy
Take a sip of that. [hands Andy his mimosa],Michael
Mmmhmmm...,Andy
That good?,Michael
Mmmm...,Andy
Don't drink all of it. Give some to Oscar.,Michael
That's really good. [offers mimosa to Oscar],Andy
I'm good.,Oscar
You want one of your own? I can hook you up.,Michael
I'm sorry. You'll need to keep moving.,Stewardess
"Yes, this is Beth. This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.",Michael
We need to keep the isle clear.,Beth
Yes...,Michael
Oh...,Andy
"Get back, get back. Come on, get back to the slums.",Michael
Oh boy. [follows Oscar back to coach],Andy
"[whisper] Hey... guys, check it out. My own personal DVD player and 20 movies.",Michael
[whispers] Andy brought one too.,Oscar
[loudly] Harry and the Henderson's,Andy
Shhhh! Keep it down.,Michael
I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich],Oscar
"Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane? [Andy laughs] My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.",Michael
[to stewardess] Hi.,Michael
Hi.,Beth
Um. I'd like to see a menu please.,Michael
"Oh, I'm sorry. There are no meals on flights less than two hours.",Beth
"Oh... okay. [looks back at Andy and Oscar] Doesn't matter, because I am going to take a nap. I think I am going to use my complimentary blindfold. I will don it... and oh! Look at that. I can't see because I am in a-- [cart crashes into Michael's leg] GAH!",Michael
What would you like to drink?,Beth
[walks into Kelly's cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon. When Pam gets back. Gonna be close quarters. Gonna be a lot of tension.,Ryan
For you. I'm with Darryl.,Kelly
This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups],Ryan
Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups],Kelly
"[talking head] No. Not going to happen. He has hurt me too much and too often. And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.",Kelly
[making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing? This is so wrong.,Kelly
Yeah... Mmmmm...,Ryan
[going up escalator in the hotel] This is nice. This is nice. Move in here. Very sweet... ah.,Michael
I'll check us in.,Oscar
Alright.,Michael
Very cool.,Andy
Very cool.,Michael
"We are going to find out where the action is, my friend.",Andy
Okay.,Michael
Where's the concierge?,Andy
Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.,Michael
"Mmm... bingo! [indicates towards concierge desk] Follow moi, bro-sieur.",Andy
Wow!,Michael
[to concierge] What about a nice sushi place? Maybe a place with a view?,Andy
"Tsk... Oh. Matsuki. That's a good one. Uh, you may walk there if you wish or you man take the number seventeen bus until 9:00. Other than that you can take the taxi and the number is right there.",Concierge
"Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you!",Michael
One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight?,Andy
"Oh, the Huntsman is good.",Concierge
[nodding towards Michael] The Huntsman.,Andy
Down here... the financial district.,Concierge
"A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha. This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure. And when you meet one, it is intoxicating. Just what the doctor ordered.",Michael
[at school in NYC] Can't believe this. [pulls out cell phone... sighs],Pam
[in office] Are you sure?,Jim
[over the phone] I just talked to my advisor. Failing.,Pam
Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.,Jim
"I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark. I hate computers.",Pam
"Okay, okay, it's no big deal. So you're not a computer geek.",Jim
I have to stay and retake it.,Pam
[looks shocked] W---Wow. Um. Well... okay.,Jim
That means another twelve weeks. [pause] Can you do this for another three months?,Pam
"It's not--- It's not about me. I mean, this your dream.",Jim
[over phone] I know.,Pam
And you went to New York to do this. So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?,Jim
[starting to cry] Right.,Pam
[concerned look on face] You okay?,Jim
"[over phone] Yeah I'm fine. Um... my cell phone battery's low, so I have to let you go.",Pam
Okay.,Jim
Alright.,Pam
Alright.,Jim
[over phone] Love you. Bye.,Pam
"Love you too. [hangs up phone, Pam sits on a bench crying]",Jim
"Guys, she's in there.",Michael
Engaging wings [imitates mechanical sound],Andy
I'm probably going to leave after one drink.,Oscar
Let's do this.,Michael
Yeah with a hot slab of Canadian bacon in your hand.,Andy
"[goes up to concierge from the hotel] Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott. Good to see you again.",Michael
Good to see you.,Marie
"Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez.",Michael
Nice to meet you. [shakes Marie's hand],Oscar

"Works in accounting. This is uh, concierge Marie...",Michael
Yes.,Oscar
"...who works at our hotel. You look, how do you say, radiant tonight.",Michael
Thank you.,Marie
"And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night---",Michael
"Michael, why?",Oscar
She's foreign. I am--,Michael
For Madame et monsieur. [hands Michael and Marie a glass of wine],Andy
"Oh, thank you.",Michael
You're welcome.,Andy
"Thank you, Andy.",Michael
Thank you?,Marie
Let me get a picture of you guys.,Andy
"Everyone is going to end up dying someday. And I think it's better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that there's somebody out there that you love that you're not with.",Michael
"Alright, I've scoped out the joint. Those two dudes are as good as naked.",Andy
How do you even know they're gay?,Oscar
Come on! It's Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there. [turns to bartender] Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island iced teas s'ill vous plait. [to Oscar] Bad decision in a glass.,Andy
"I don't care if you're gay, straight, engaged... whatever. A guy needs intercourse.",Andy
You'll thank me when they spank thee.,Andy
Don't do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table],Oscar
Do you guys like apples?,Andy
What?,Guy at table
Do you like apples?,Andy
"Uh, sorry... what?",Guy at table
"Well, how do you like these apples? [sets drinks on table] Alright, on a scale of 1 - 10, how hot is that dude? [indicates towards Oscar who waves slightly]",Andy
Is he your boyfriend or something?,Guy at table
"No, but he could be yours if you play your cards right.",Andy
"Dude, leave us alone alright?",Guy
Gentleman. [walks away],Andy
What are you doing?,Oscar
"Dude, you struck out. They're totally stuck up. Here... drink up.",Andy
How about this one? It's Christmas eve---,Michael
Mmm-hmmm...,Concierge Marie
---and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12:00 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do? What do you do? Come on! What do you do?,Michael
Uh...A stro cleaners on St. Johns place is the only place open on that day.,Marie
Unbelievable! Unbelievable.,Michael
If you don't mind me asking---,Oscar
Anything. You can ask me anything.,Andy
Okay.,Oscar
I'm your wingman.,Andy
"Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.",Oscar
Right-o.,Andy
How could anyone stand that woman?,Oscar
What?,Andy
What do you see in her? Wh -- what do you see in Angela?,Oscar
What do I see in Angela?,Andy
I want to know.,Oscar
I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle. She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that. And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have sex with her.,Andy
You haven't had sex?,Oscar
No.,Andy
"Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?",Oscar
"Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for.",Andy
"Andy, something is wrong with that woman.",Oscar
What is wrong with her?,Andy
I'd like to know. You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her.,Oscar
I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her?,Andy
"Do it! It's a--- Call her! [Andy holds up phone] Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don't call her!",Oscar
"Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing. [Oscar laughs] Shh...",Andy
[on phone] Hello? Hello?,Angela
What is wrong with you?,Andy
Why won't you do Andy?,Oscar
What?,Angela
That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won't do me and I think it's a valid question.,Andy
Are you drunk?,Angela
This is Andy Bernard!,Andy
I know who this is!,Angela
I wanna take you to sex school.,Andy
What?,Angela
[over phone] Who is that monkey?,Dwight
Is somebody there?,Andy
Are you drunk?,Angela
I have needs.,Andy
We will discuss this later.,Angela
Naked.,Andy
What?,Angela
We'll discuss it later naked. I want to see you naked.,Andy
[standing outside hotel room... whispering] Do you want to get some breakfast or something?,Michael
I am so tired.,Concierge Marie
Okay.,Michael
[noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already?,Jim
Know what?,Dwight
Pam failed art school.,Meredith
"Oh, well, doesn't surprise me.",Dwight
Excuse me?,Jim
"Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.",Dwight
"Dwight, stop it.",Phyllis
Dwight.,Stanley
What? Are there two suns?,Dwight
Come on.,Meredith
Oh my God.,Stanley
"Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.",Dwight
I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.,Jim
It's totally unrealistic. There are no lines in the parking lot.,Dwight
Oscar,Andy
Hey.,Oscar
That was fun last night.,Andy
"Yeah, it was.",Oscar
"You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada.",Andy
"Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up.",Oscar
You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards. [Oscar laughs],Andy
I can't believe we called her up. [both laugh],Oscar
Totally. [continues laughing] What--- Who?,Andy
I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.,Oscar
We called Angela?,Andy
You--- you call--- you called her.,Oscar
"That was real?! I thought I dreamed that. Oh, God!",Andy
Alright.,Oscar
"Oh, God!",Andy
Okay.,Oscar
So bad!,Andy
"Good morning, Michael. [Michael approaches table] Are you ready for the meeting?",Oscar
Slept like a baby.,Michael
Mmmm.... mmm. This can't happen again.,Kelly
This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?,Ryan
Yeah.,Kelly
Okay. You have to break up with Darryl. I already typed out a text message for you. All you have to do is press 'send'.,Ryan
"I don't know. I mean, it's well-written and all, I just---",Kelly
Has to be done. We'll press send together. [phone beeps],Ryan
Oh my God. He's going to kill us.,Kelly
I'd like to see him try. [kisses Kelly... cell phone beeps],Ryan
"Oh! He says it's cool. [laughs] He said, 'It's cool'.",Kelly
That's all he wrote?,Ryan
That's all he wrote.,Kelly
Can I see it?,Ryan
Mmm hmm.,Kelly
Didn't you two date for like a long time?,Ryan
Mmm hmm. It's like a fairy tale! [grabs Ryan and kisses him] Mmmm...,Kelly
I'll be honest with you--- we've been talking with Catalyst Paper. Their prices are better than yours.,Client
"Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here. They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter. They are treated like human beings. [sighs]",Michael
Everything okay?,Client
Yes.,Michael
"Oh man, she is so pissed. [sitting down by Oscar]",Andy
Mmm...,Oscar
She's taking us back to first base.,Andy
What is first base with Angela?,Oscar
I get to kiss her forehead. [looks at Oscar] I had a good time hanging out this weekend.,Andy
I had a good time too.,Oscar
Wingman for life. W.M.F.L,Andy
Thank you.,Oscar
You up for a chest bump?,Andy
No.,Oscar
Bro hug? [Oscar shakes head... then sticks his hand out and Andy shakes it] Back to basics. I like it.,Andy
I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me. And he's delightful! [laughs],Andy
[on phone] Hey! I just heard you guys made the sale.,David Wallace
"Yeah, we locked him up for two years.",Michael
"Good, very good. See, told you. Sounds like somebody had a good trip.",David Wallace
No. Actually the trip sucked.,Michael
Excuse me?,David Wallace
"The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.",Michael
What are you talking about?,David Wallace
"I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.",Michael
Okay.,David Wallace
And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.,Michael
"The hotel? What, M--- okay.",David Wallace
"It was not, it sucked.",Michael
I'm sorry to hear the hotel was bad.,David Wallace
Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige. That was great. That was great. That was--- that was a---,Michael
"Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey.",Dacvid Walalce
That was a really good choice.,Michael
"Michael, please lets listen for a second.",David Wallcve
"No, David. You listen to me. Why did you send her away? That--- God. You knew I liked her and you just sent her away. And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man.",Michael
"Michael, sometimes---",Dacvid Wallace
That was a really sucky thing to do.,Michael
"Sometimes, we-- [Michael hangs up phone]",David Wallace
"Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck. 'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete. I think it's because they respect me. A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone. That's respect.",Michael
"You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats.",Kevin
Thanks man.,Jim
"I'm coming back the wrong way. [smiles at Jim across the parking lot] It's not because of you. I don't like graphic design. That's it. [laughs] Stop smiling. I really didn't like it. It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton. But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it?",Pam
I missed you.,Jim
I missed you too. [Jim kisses her],Pam
You're back.,Dwight
"Uh, yeah.",Pam
Good. I need you to make five copies of these. [hands Pam papers],Dwight
I'm not going inside.,Pam
Alright. First thing in the morning then.,Dwight
Welcome back.,Jim
We're back together again baby.,Kelly
We're back.,Ryan
"They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny.",Kelly
I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.,Ryan
Oh!,Kelly
[whispers] Yeah.,Ryan
"Are you swallowing them whole? You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?",Angela
[with mouth full] Yes.,Kevin
"Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.",Dwight
So why did you come in here?,Jim
To socialize. And inform.,Dwight
"Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.",Michael
You're taking two?,Ryan
"Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.",Kelly
Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica?,Michael
"Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now.",Kelly
"Heh, okay, weirdo.",Michael
"Why is that, why is that weird?",Jim
She said she was going to give it to him right now. [starts laughing],Michael
"[laughing] She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.",Jim
"Yeah, they used to.",Michael
Toby works here again.,Jim
"Oh, can you imagine?",Michael
Oh no.,Jim
Uhhgh.,Michael
You don't know.,Jim
I don't know. What?,Michael
"You should probably just meander back there; take a look. See if he's, see if he's back.",Jim
"Hmmm, dare I? [laughs] You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake. [walks to the annex, standing in Toby's cubicle] Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex. [turns around and sees Toby]",Michael
"Hi, Micha-",Toby
"NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!",Michael
[watching Toby at Phyllis' desk through his office blinds] Look at him. With his stupid face. Stupid... tan. No.,Michael
He looks great.,Dwight
No.,Michael
Well rested.,Dwight
He looks worse.,Michael
"Michael, is everyone okay?",David
"Uh, well I'm afraid not. Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance.",Michael
"I don't understand, is anyone hurt?",David
"Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.",Michael
"Michael, you texted me, 911 CALL ME.",David
Yes.,Michael
All in caps. Do you know what 911 means?,David
"I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls. Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.",Michael
Now what I'm curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.,David
I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.,Michael
"Also, it's icky back there.",Dwight
That's true. People say it's icky.,Michael
"Okay, I have to go.",David
"David, wait.",Michael
No.,David
Is there no way we can get rid of him?,Michael
"Not without cause, Michael.",David
I have cause. It is be-cause I hate him.,Michael
You have to get along with Toby.,David
No.,Michael
Yep.,David
I don't.,Michael
"Goodbye, Michael. [hangs up]",David
"[Dwight comes over, starts to massage Michael's shoulders] Don't do that.",Michael
"[pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this? Disgusting.",Pam
"So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place?",Andy
"Yeah, I am. Wait, how do you know that? I didn't tell you that.",Jim
"Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk. I saw some email. I got peepers of an eagle.",Andy
That's really not cool.,Jim
Kaaw!,Andy
"So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?",Kevin
"Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right.",Jim
"Today's a big day. Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom. It's got shag carpets. I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's. And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting] She's gonna love it. Right?",Jim
Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?,Jim
"Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle? You're in for a spanking my friend. Myself and my lady? - no secrets.",Andy
"Jim, don't listen to Andy. I think it's so romantic.",Phyllis
"Oh thanks, Phyllis.",Jim
Where's your place?,Phyllis
"Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave? By the quarry?",Jim
Ohhh...,Phyllis
"Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry. We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there.",Creed
Definitely we should.,Jim
"[reading from a note on the microwave] 'To whoever made the microwave mess: the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance. By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter. Sincerely, disappointed.'",Oscar
That is just obnoxious.,Andy
No kidding.,Oscar
"Yeah. Wait, what, the mess or the note?",Pam
The note. So 'holier than thou'.,Oscar
"Hmm, I liked it.",Angela
Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?,Pam
"No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess.",Andy
"Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.",Meredith
"Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich.",Pam
"Yeh, they're rich.",Meredith
"You want to see some really high caliber acting? Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. [walks to the annex] Hey Toby, great to have you back, man. Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.",Michael
Well thanks Michael.,Toby
You're welcome. Missed you. Missed you as part of our family.,Michael
"Well that's sweet, I missed you guys too.",Toby
So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun? That must have been fun.,Michael
"Well, um, it was amazing. It really was, thanks for asking. Um the beaches were pristine...",Toby
"Nice beaches, pristine beaches?",Michael
"...and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic.",Toby
Why'd you come back? Why didn't you stay?,Michael
It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.,Toby
"I bet, for you.",Michael
"And uh, yeah, plus it was hot.",Toby
"[shifting uncomfortably and sweating] Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.",Michael
"Are you all right, Michael?",Toby
"Yeah, I am. I am.",Michael
"I tried, I tried. I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail. I feel like I'm dying inside. I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II. She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends. I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.",Michael
"Okay, just summarize.",Michael
"Okay, fireable offenses include: workplace violence and sexual harassment.",Dwight
"That's it, that's it, perfect. We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.",Michael
I love catching people in the act. That's why I always whip open doors.,Dwight
"Mm. Me too. Okay, let's get this started.",Michael
Okay [stands up removes jacket and starts loosening his tie],Dwight
What are you doing?,Michael
[removes glasses] I am the bait.,Dwight
For what?,Michael
Men find me desirable.,Dwight
"No, no, no.",Michael
"Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.",Dwight
You're the bait for Toby?,Michael
Mmhmm.,Dwight
"No, for one thing, he's not gay. And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim. Or Ryan. Or me.",Michael
Men find me desirable.,Dwight
"Yes, sure they do, Dwight.",Michael
"When it comes down to it, it's a health issue. I should have written that.",Pam
"Mmhmm, yeah.",Jim
[looks up] Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?,Pam
"Oh totally. Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?",Jim
Are you inching away from me?,Pam
No.,Jim
Reach your arms out.,Pam
[laughs and swings his arm out which doesn't come close to touching the reception desk] I'm always this close.,Jim
"Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah. Hello, Pam. Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.",Michael
"Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...",Jim
"Oh, oooh his mistress. No. I'm kidding. No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.",Michael
"What do you need, Michael?",Pam
"Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson? I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits. Do not read it beforehand. Can you do that for me?",Michael
"Good. [Pam stands up and starts reading note] N-no no no, don't.",Michael
"Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle. I'm too shy to tell you that I love you.'",Pam
"Pam. Pam, you gave me your word.",Michael
[kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me?,Ryan
Mmhmm.,Kelly
Are you happy you did?,Ryan
Hey guys that's really inappropriate.,Toby
[kisses for a little longer] What's up?,Ryan
"Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?",Michael
"Yeah, yeah I'll see them.",Ryan
Toby can I see those? Ooh. [takes photos and throws them on the floor] What's the matter? What's the matter? You scared?,Michael
Those are fighting words.,Dwight
You mad? You mad at me?,Michael
I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.,Dwight
"Do you want to do that? You want to hit me, you want to punch me?",Michael
Hmmm?,Dwight
Huh? He might do it...,Michael
"Punch him, Toby!",Kelly
I dare you to. Come on.,Michael
Come on. [making karate moves] Baaah!,Dwight
What's the matter... haaaww!,Michael
"Hit him! Hit him, Chicken.",Dwight
"Yeah, punch him.",Ryan
"Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?",Michael
"Ryan. Come on, man?",Dwight
"No do it, do it. I dare you.",Michael
Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.,Dwight
"Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch. Come on! Come oooon...",Michael
"I'm not going to punch you, Michael.",Toby
Are you really not going to punch him?,Dwight
"No, why would I punch you?",Toby
Son of a bitch.,Michael
"[as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it. Once in a lifetime, man.",Ryan
I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day,Dwight
[mouth full of brownie] Just stop it. You haven't done anything helpful all day.,Michael
There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.,Dwight
What's that?,Michael
"[goes over and closes office door] Frame him, for using drugs.",Dwight
Frame him?,Michael
"Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.",Dwight
"I've never framed a man before, have you?",Michael
Oh I've framed animals before. I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present. And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.,Dwight
Just seems awfully mean. But sometimes the ends justify the mean.,Michael
"Hello. I've seen you guys around. I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. How you doing? [they stare at him] Uhghh, so I guess you know why I'm here? I need to purchase something.",Michael
A fridge?,Vance Refrigeration guy
"No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...",Michael
What?,Vance Refrigeration guy
"Grass, weed?",Michael
What makes you think we'd have weed?,Leo
I heard you drug--- I heard you dealt.,Michael
"[whispers in Leo's ear] Hey, just hold on one second.",Vance Refrigeration Guy
"I'm not wearing a wire, so...",Michael
Why would you even say that?,Leo
"[comes back up to Michael] Hey, that's gonna be 500 dollars.",Vance Refrigeration Guy
How much? How many pounds is it?,Michael
"It's- it's two pounds. I'm losing money on this man just, give me the money. Alright, walk away.",Vance Refrigeration Guy
Walk away.,Leo
Walk away.,Vance Refrigeration Guy
"Hey, Pam? I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.",Ryan
Thank you.,Pam
"I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.",Ryan
"I know, can you believe it?",Pam
"Yeah, it's crazy. But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up.",Ryan
"I guess that's why we have a temp, huh?",Pam
"Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me. I would just make it worse.",Ryan
How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?,Pam
I--- I would find a way.,Ryan
"You've seen things cleaned before though, right?",Pam
"I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...",Ryan
"Hi, Michael.",Kelly
"Hey, hey, hey. Hey. I forgot... I forgot...",Michael
"[on a cell phone in the hallway] Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin. His name is Toby Flenderson [Michael opens Toby's desk drawer and puts something in it] and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America. I have risked a great deal to tell you this information. My name is Andy Bernard. Andrew Bernard, that's my name. See you soon.",Dwight
"Hi, we received a call?",Police Officer 1
I don't know anything about that.,Pam
We were tipped off about a possible narcotics situation.,Police Officer 1
Here?,Pam
"Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay? Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office. [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears]",Dwight
Just pretend like we're talking until the cops leave.,Creed
"Those are real cops, real guns. I wonder what's going on. [follows them]",Michael
"Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.",Dwight
"Hey, what is this?",Toby
Search his things.,Dwight
"Sir, can you step away from your desk please?",Police Officer 2
Why?,Toby
"Sir, please step away from your desk.",Police Officer 2
"Hey, what's going on? You don't have my permission to do this.",Toby
"They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.",Dwight
"Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?",Toby
"Uh, you know what? I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.",Michael
Don't search my stuff.,Toby
Sir?,Police Officer 1
I have a reasonable right to privacy.,Toby
"Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.",Dwight
Michael!,Toby
"Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay?",Michael
"Sir, did you recently return from a trip to Central America?",Police Officer 1
Oh my God!,Toby
"No, no no no... No, no.",Michael
That was... I went to Costa Rica for a few months. What is going on?,Toby
"No, that was... that was legitimate. That was totally legitimate.",Michael
Really?,Police Officer 1
Check this out.,Police Officer 2
Oh God!,Michael
That is not mine. I have never seen that before.,Toby
"No, no no no no.",Michael
Turn around.,Police Officer 1
What is going on here?,Toby
"God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is. And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!",Michael
Do you have any weapons?,Police Officer 1
Of course not!,Toby
"Ahh, that's mine.",Michael
"No! Michael, no!",Dwight
"Yes, it's mine.",Michael
"Some basil. Salad dressing, I think.",Police Officer 2
Salad dressing?,Police Officer 1
"Yeah it's, uh, a caprese salad. There's a little bit of, uh, mozerella right there.",Police Officer 2
Are you kidding me? That's my salad.,Michael
"So wait a minute, there's no drugs?",Dwight
No.,Police Officer 2
"Gahh, dammit! [punches file cabinet] Come on!",Dwight
We got a fake tip.,Police Officer 1
"Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?",Dwight
No.,Police Officer 1
[following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation. Why don't you use them?,Dwight
You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.,Michael
"I didn't put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.",Toby
Hmm.,Michael
Did you?,Toby
Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.,Michael
"You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.",Toby
"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about? You're... you're worried about the cop's time? You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer? Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.",Michael
You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us. So...,Michael
I did leave.,Toby
"Yes, you did. And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.",Michael
"Well, I don't see it that way.",Toby
Do you want to hear a lie?,Michael
What?,Toby
I think you're great. You're my best friend.,Michael
[stops kissing Kelly] I can't do this.,Ryan
Can't do what?,Kelly
It's not fair to you. And it's really not fair to me.,Ryan
"Wait, what are you saying? I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.",Kelly
That was your choice; don't put that on me. I'm just going on a little trip.,Ryan
"Oh, can I come?",Kelly
"It's not that kind of trip. I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school. And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go. And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?",Ryan
So you're dumping me?,Kelly
"Let's be adults about this. Let's have sex one more time. And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.",Ryan
Okay?,Kelly
"[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?",Jim
Sure.,Pam
Cool.,Jim
[getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house?,Pam
"I have a surprise for you. All right, ready? Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes. Tadah!",Jim
I don't get it.,Pam
"I bought it. It's ours. Let's go inside, I'll show you inside. [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor. Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet. Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall] Yeah, I am really sorry about this. I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there. Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood. [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door]",Jim
"[outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage. It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio. [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that. And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---",Jim
I love it.,Pam
You do?,Jim
"Yeah, I love it!",Pam
Really?,Jim
"I mean, you bought me a house!",Pam
Oh my God...,Jim
You bought me a house!,Pam
"Yeah, I did. [they kiss]",Jim
"Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom?",Pam
"No, No, we'll just board that up. It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.",Jim
And the clown?,Pam
"Yeah, I can't... really can't move him.",Jim
"What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover. I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.",Dwight
Here are our final actual costs for this year.,Oscar
Mmm... okay.,Michael
"As you can see, we did pretty well, so...",Oscar
"Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.",Michael
"Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...",Oscar
Yes.,Michael
Right there.,Oscar
There's the x-ax...icks.,Michael
You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.,Oscar
"Mmhmm, okay.",Michael
But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.,Oscar
Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.,Michael
Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.,Oscar
Ho-oh!,Michael
So you have an extra dollar.,Oscar
Yeah.,Michael
"So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...",Oscar
I'll be six.,Michael
"And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.",Oscar
So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.,Michael
We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.,Oscar
[whistles poorly] Whoo.,Michael
"We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.",Oscar
"Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you...",Michael
"Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please... [imitates drum roll] Can anybody guess?",Michael
New chairs?,Pam
"No, a new copier! [only Oscar applauds] Unless everybody can agree on something better?",Michael
"No, no, please. Please do not do this.",Oscar
"Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.",Pam
So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?,Michael
"[over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good...",Pam
"Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?",Oscar
"Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.",Pam
"Pam, you make more copies than anyone.",Oscar
Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.,Pam
"Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one.",Michael
I'm with Pam. Chairs.,Stanley
"Alright, so, teams forming.",Michael
"We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.",Toby
You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.,Michael
You'll see.,Toby
Michael?,Pam
Yes.,Michael
"I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.",Pam
"Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier.",Jim
What? Jim.,Pam
"Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.",Jim
"Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.",Meredith
"The balls on you, man.",Creed
"So Michael, what do you think?",Oscar
Why me?,Michael
You have to make the decision.,Jim
"Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.",Michael
"Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms...",Andy
"Yeah, do tell.",Dwight
"I mean, like, '156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left.'",Andy
Mmhmm.,Dwight
Walk until you hear the beehive.',Andy
How could it be more clear?,Dwight
I think Andy makes an excellent point.,Angela
Okay.,Dwight
But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.,Angela
"We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.",Dwight
Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench.,Angela
"Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.",Dwight
"Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan?",Andy
"We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit.",Andy
Hey.,Pam
Hey.,Jim
"So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...",Pam
Mmhmm.,Jim
I really think you should reconsider.,Pam
"Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.",Jim
"Yeah, I know.",Pam
Yeah.,Jim
But I really think you should reconsider.,Pam
"Beesly, are you threatening me?",Jim
"Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right.",Pam
Okay.,Jim
[shudders] Whew.,Jim
This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.,Dwight
"Hmm... mm, what's that smell?",Andy
You're gonna need to be more specific.,Dwight
Manure. Get rid of it.,Angela
Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.,Dwight
Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?,Angela
"You wanna eat, don't you?",Dwight
"Honey, say something!",Angela
"Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?",Andy
...I'll consider it.,Dwight
"See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. [steps in manure, trying to laugh it off] ...Darn! Heh.",Andy
There's a hose out back.,Dwight
Okay.,Andy
"Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?",Pam
Yes.,Michael
Well that never happened.,Pam
Michael?,Oscar
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.,Michael
I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?,Oscar
"Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.",Michael
"Woah, you guys going to lunch?",Jim
Yes.,Michael
Mind if I join?,Jim
"Ohh, God!",Michael
All right.,Jim
Yeah!,Michael
Let's go.,Jim
Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!,Michael
Let's do it.,Jim
All right! Cool!,Michael
Where we going?,Jim
I have no idea.,Michael
"So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. [very serious] It is so on.",Pam
"Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?",Pam
[laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.,Oscar
"Michael, that is hilarious.",Jim
"[through the laughter] Oh, is somebody making fun of me?",Michael
"The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]",Oscar
Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.,Jim
Aww.,Pam
Yeah.,Jim
"That's cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage]",Pam
You look really pretty.,Jim
Thank you. [goes to Michael's office and knocks on the door],Pam
Yeah.,Michael
Michael?,Pam
Yeah?,Michael
Hey!,Pam
"Oh, hey.",Michael
You got a second?,Pam
I do.,Michael
"Oh, good.",Pam
"Oh, that must've been so fun.",Pam
it was fun. We had a good time.,Michael
"Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?",Pam
"Oh, thank you.",Michael
"Yeah, is that a new tie?",Pam
"Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.",Michael
That is amazing!,Pam
You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.,Michael
What?,Pam
Nine dollars. The boys' department.,Michael
No.,Pam
Look at the ass. Check out the ass.,Michael
[applauding] No way!,Pam
Look at that. [begins dancing] Unh. Unh-unh.,Michael
"Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.",Pam
Yes they were.,Michael
Yeah.,Pam
They were.,Michael
Here's what I was thinking: everyone sits on a chair every day...,Pam
Mmhmm.,Michael
But not everyone...,Pam
Sits on a copier.,Michael
Or even uses the copier every day.,Pam
Yeah.,Michael
"Yeah, right?",Pam
Very valid.,Michael
...That's it. [giggles],Pam
All right.,Michael
"All right, see you later...",Pam
See ya.,Michael
Hot tie guy.,Pam
[laughs] Hahaha!... well...,Michael
Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?,Dwight
No. I haven't thought of it.,Angela
"Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.",Dwight
I would like cat.,Angela
Cats don't make butter.,Dwight
I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.,Angela
It doesn't make any sense.,Dwight
Yes it does!,Angela
"Okay, guys!",Andy
I want a butter sculpture of a cat!,Angela
"Cow, goat or sheep.",Dwight
"What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it- [steps in manure] Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!",Andy
"[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.",Jim
"No, copier's great.",Pam
Yeah?,Jim
Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies],Pam
There they are.,Jim
"And I have my original. [holds up original paper, ripped in half]",Pam
You got it.,Jim
So suck it.,Pam
Okay.,Jim
Okay.,Michael
"Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.",Kevin
"Oh, thank you my dear.",Michael
"Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.",Kelly
"Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay...",Michael
There he is!,Stanley
"There he is! Hello, hello!",Michael
Hello.,Phyllis
Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.,Michael
Oh!,Jim
Mm! [gives Jim a high five] Yeah!,Michael
There's that ass!,Pam
Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!,Michael
"Woo! Yeah. Aw, don't take it away!",Pam
"Oh... ah, I almost choked.",Michael
Here's another place.,Dwight
It's beautiful.,Angela
Hey-o!,Andy
"So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.",Dwight
[whistling Pachelbel's 'Canon in D;' switches to singing then back to whistling],Andy
"[to minister] Hello, I'm Angela Martin, and-",Angela
I'm Andy.,Andy
I work with Dwight.,Angela
He doesn't understand a word you're saying.,Dwight
What?,Andy
"Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister; minister begins speaking in German] And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, 'I do.' [Andy mouths, 'I do' silently] And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply...",Dwight
I do.,Angela
"And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.",Dwight
Got a call about a problem up here.,Hank
Did somebody call Hank?,Pam
"Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads.",Michael
"So, there's no security problem? You know, I hustled up the stairs.",Hank
"Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. [Hank takes some jellybeans from Pam's jar] Yeah, take as many as you want.",Michael
"Thank you. Thank you. You know, it's nice and warm up here.",Hank
Yes.,Michael
So what are we talking about?,Hank
"Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-",Michael
I know what a surplus is.,Hank
"Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.",Michael
Is that the copier?,Hank
"It is, yes.",Michael
[inspects the copier] Hmm.,Hank
What?,Michael
I was just thinking. Let me see a chair.,Hank
Okay.,Michael
You can try mine.,Pam
"Oh, there we go.",Michael
"Hmm, not much lumbar support.",Hank
"Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.",Michael
"On the one hand, this copier is very old. You should see some of the new copiers they have. You would not believe what they do.",Hank
"So, the copier.",Michael
"Well, let me finish.",Hank
"All right, yes.",Michael
Now the chairs. The chairs are very weak. Very weak chairs. I could not sit all day in this chair.,Hank
"Well, what should I do?",Michael
...Let me see the copier again.,Hank
"All right, get out. Get out.",Michael
"Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.",Angela
I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.,Dwight
What do you mean?,Angela
"Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, 'I do.' And I said, 'I do.' And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.",Dwight
Dwight! That doesn't count!,Angela
"Yes, of course it does.",Dwight
"No, it doesn't!",Angela
It does in the state of Pennsylvania.,Dwight
I didn't-,Angela
"Haha, Mrs. Schrute.",Dwight
We are not married.,Angela
Wha...,Dwight
Take this thing. [takes off twine ring],Angela
My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!,Dwight
"Are we, uh... are we leaving or what? [Mose hits Andy in the head with a deflated ball] Ow!",Andy
[on speakerphone] Michael.,David
Hey David- [begins coughing violently] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.,Michael
Is this why you're calling me?,David
"No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling- [coughs again] I'm sorry.",Michael
Okay.,David
"Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.",Michael
You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?,David
"No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.",Michael
"Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus.",David
The what now?,Michael
Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.,David
...Like a tip? [calculates amount] $645?!,Michael
"I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.",Michael
"[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.",Jim
"All right, attention everyone.",Michael
Let me call you right back. Okay.,Jim
"I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is... [puts paper on glass and makes a copy, then takes paper from glass] working perfectly.",Michael
That's the original.,Oscar
"Pam, would you stand up for a sec? [sits in Pam's chair] Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. [slowly sinking into the chair] Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers? [the chair has slowly lowered itself almost to where Michael is not visible over the desk] They don't have copiers. They don't even- [struggles to get up from Pam's chair] Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.",Michael
Do you know?,Oscar
Do I know what?,Michael
I think you know.,Oscar
"Mm, no...",Michael
Know what?,Phyllis
"Yeah, know what?",Pam
Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?,Oscar
$645.00 ,Michael
Michael's a genius.,Kevin
Right.,Michael
Why'd you say dollars?,Oscar
Because that is how my mind works.,Michael
"What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.",Oscar
"Wait, what?",Jim
You can do that?,Pam
"Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912?",Kevin
Let's see...,Michael
You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?,Pam
"I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less.",Michael
You're gonna get us a copier then?,Oscar
This is so stupid.,Michael
Or chairs?,Pam
"This is so, so stupid. And, God... [looks at his watch] that's my phone.",Michael
I didn't hear a phone.,Stanley
To be continued!,Michael
"No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.",Michael
"Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. [Angela walks over to Andy] What-",Andy
"[kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.",Angela
Was that hot or what?,Andy
So what's it gonna be?,Pam
"Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.",Oscar
"Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.",Pam
You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.,Oscar
[groans in frustration] You think it's easy?,Michael
It's your job.,Stanley
"Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?",Michael
"It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just- [Pam and Oscar come to the door of kitchen] Hey.",Michael
Hey.,Pam
"Hey, we're going with the chairs.",Oscar
What?,Michael
I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.,Oscar
Thanks Michael.,Pam
Good work. I'm proud of you. [Pam and Oscar leave] Mother-,Michael
"[wearing a fur coat] What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, [camera zooms out to see fake blood is splattered on the fur coat] you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.",Michael
Truce?,Jim
"Yeah, I guess, since I won.",Pam
"Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]",Jim
What is this?,Dwight
"Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.",Jim
You're so pathetic. How long did this take you? Three hours?,Dwight
Five minutes actually. I am a black belt in gift wrapping.,Jim
"Yeah, no such thing. They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs] Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.",Dwight
I think it'll take you a little longer than that.,Jim
"Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]",Dwight
Eh...,Stanley
I'm sorry. It's the largest one I have.,Phyllis
I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat],Stanley
"This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee. The theme is 'Nights in Morocco'. This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party. Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.",Phyllis
"Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?",Michael
Yes.,Phyllis
Awesome. I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.,Michael
Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.,Phyllis
It's the nativity scene.,Angela
"Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay. Everything else goes in the drawer.",Phyllis
I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas. There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.,Angela
I need you to get rid of the tree.,Phyllis
But--,Angela
Thank you.,Phyllis
"Oh, I don't think it's blackmail. Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight. I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.",Phyllis
Ah. You brought in your doll collection.,Jim
"These are not dolls, Jim. These are commodities. Same as gold or oil.",Dwight
"Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season. This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn. Catchphrase: 'My horn can pierce the sky'. Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks. And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit. Isn't that right princess? [makes doll nod]",Dwight
That's the Christmas spirit.,Jim
I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift. And such a genetically improbable one. Look at that. How does that happen? King has sex with a unicorn? Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?,Dwight
Yes.,Jim
"Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn? I thought they were all sold out.",Michael
They are now.,Dwight
Cool. [sings] My horn can pierce the sky.,Michael
"This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.",Michael
[drinks] Oh... my... GOD!!! [laughs] Hit me again.,Meredith
Alright... One more time around the block.,Michael
I will grant you one wish.,Jim
I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.,Pam
Stupid. Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.,Jim
"[sitting on floor playing the sitar] Hey, hey... Ange... check it out. [sings] There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance. [laughs]",Andy
Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.,Angela
[sings] There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.,Andy
"Jim, Jim....",Michael
What is it?,Jim
That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice. I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.,Michael
"Wow, that is delicious.",Jim
Yeah.,Michael
Can't believe no ones thought of that.,Jim
I know.,Michael
[dancing drunkenly] Ahh yeah!!,Meredith
"[continuing to dance, lifting her shirt] Belly dancing!",Meredith
"120, 180... 200.",Guy buying doll
All right.,Dwight
Thank you so much. My daughter is going to love this.,Guy
"Oh, so glad I could help.",Dwight
Thanks.,Guy
Merry Christmas.,Dwight
You too.,Guy
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.,Dwight
"[sighs] Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India.",Michael
"[Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!",Jim
We got a live one! On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith],Dwight
I'm all right. I'm all right.,Meredith
Sorry.,Andy
"We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?",Oscar
"Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth",Michael
What about February 2nd?,Oscar
Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?,Jim
"No, no. I celebrate privately.",Michael
That's cool.,Jim
Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.,Michael
Now? It's our Christmas party.,Oscar
We'll do it quickly.,Michael
Well what if we can't do it quickly.,Jim
[mimicking] What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--,Michael
Do you know how to do an intervention?,Oscar
"Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.",Michael
"An intervention. It's sort of hard to describe, but really its-- it's a coming together... it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions. And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves. And then they stop.",Michael
"It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone. Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.",Phyllis
I don't--,Angela
And napkins... fanned.,Phyllis
"Okay, how do you feel?",Michael
A little better. I threw up.,Meredith
Uck... T.M.I.,Michael
Fire girl. [looks around] Too soon?,Kevin
Yeah.,Jim
"Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.",Michael
"Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith's work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.",Toby
I am not asking her to stop drinking. I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.,Michael
I'm not an alcoholic.,Meredith
"Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand]",Michael
Aye.,Dwight
The aye's have it.,Michael
I don't care what everyone thinks. I know I am not an alcoholic.,Meredith
"Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we? [pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket]",Michael
"When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke. I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class. Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses. They called me Ace. It was totally awesome. Got straight B's. They called me Buzz.",Andy
"Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?",Michael
Sure.,Meredith
Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?,Michael
Obviously.,Meredith
Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?,Michael
Where did you get this?,Oscar
"I got it on a website, that's not important.",Michael
"Michael, We should contact some experts. You don't know what your doing.",Toby
"Okay, you know what Toby? One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this. I'm doing your job man. Hey, are you texting?",Michael
"Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag.",Kelly
"Alcohol is a drag. Yes. Here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us. I'll begin. This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this. That's how your drinking affected me. Anybody else? Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you? Come on people. If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better. [Kevin raises his hand] Yes, Kevin.",Michael
"Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me. And that was really cool.",Kevin
That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.,Michael
"Yeah, you said affected by it. Thanks again, Meredith.",Kevin
You're welcome.,Meredith
"Okay, no, that's not what we're going for. Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking? It has to bother you. It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you? Dwight, don't you have anything?",Michael
"No, I like Meredith.",Dwight
"Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing. In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.",Dwight
Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke? Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?,Michael
I am fine.,Meredith
"Was John Belushi fine? Was Bob Hope fine? Hey-- come here. If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.",Michael
I know I drink. I like to party,Meredith
I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.,Michael
I am not an alcoholic!,Meredith
"You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you.",Michael
I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore.,Phyllis
Please stop making me do these things.,Angela
"Oh, sorry, it's your job.",Phyllis
But it's the season of mercy.,Angela
You never showed me mercy when you were in charge. Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?,Phyllis
I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on],Angela
Ok... nice.,Phyllis
I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction. I do. To porn.,Meredith
"[amid groans from the rest of the office] Alright, no, no, no. No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting. But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today. What about tomorrow.? What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?",Michael
I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.,Dwight
"There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.",Dwight
"Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore. The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.",Michael
"Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.",Dwight
Dwight--,Michael
She is a hazard to the other people of the office.,Dwight
[sighs]...okay.,Michael
I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.,Dwight
"Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.",Jim
"Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.",Dwight
I can get you one in an hour.,Creed
Really?,Dwight
"Okay you know, this-- this is over.",Toby
I agree.,Stanley
"Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.",Jim
"Enabler! Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler. It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.",Michael
"You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better. That's my only wish. But you know what? My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.",Michael
[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.,Jim
"I know. If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]",Pam
That's a halwa shabkia cookie. They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out],Phyllis
Mmmm... chewy.,Stanley
[Andy playing the sitar] Hey.,Jim
What's up?,Andy
Do you take requests?,Jim
Sure.,Andy
Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.,Jim
[whispers to Meredith] I'll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?,Michael
Sure. Wow. [Michael throws a pen at his head] Ow...,Toby
We just missed Poor Richards.,Meredith
We did?,Michael
"Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?",Meredith
"Oh, shoot. Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess.",Michael
"The Bog? Cooper's, Kelly's...",Meredith
"We could go there, sure.",Michael
"...Brixx's, Carmen's...",Meredith
"Yes, yes.",Michael
"...The Fort, Andy Gavin's.",Meredith
I have a new place.,Michael
"Well, it must have just opened up.",Meredith
"It-- yep, recently.",Michael
Yeah... all right.,Meredith
All right.,Michael
Enough of this Christmas crap. Let's get some party music. [changes radio station] Yeah!,Meredith
"Yeah, oh there you go.",Michael
Yeah!,Meredith
That's good.,Michael
Yeah that's better.,Meredith
We're party girls.,Michael
"[on phone] Hey Sasha, it's daddy. Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?",Toby
"[shouting excitedly over the phone] Daddy, daddy, daddy!!",Sasha
"No, No, No. No, I'm just curious if you've heard of it.",Toby
This is great. My ex-wife's going to be so pissed. [chuckles] For once daddy's gonna be a hero.,Toby
$200.00 ,Dwight
Yo.,Darryl
"Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls.",Toby
"Oh, that's my last one.",Dwight
"Oh, no, I-- no, no, I was gonna buy that doll.",Toby
Thanks man.,Darryl
I was-- I was gonna get the doll.,Toby
Not my problem.,Dwight
"But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll. I-- I'm-- I'm begging you. I just-- I need it more than anything in this world. I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll.",Toby
"All right man, don't cry. It's cool. I'll let you get it for $400.",Darryl
I only have $200.,Toby
You can owe me.,Darryl
"[laughs] Oh man, thanks, thank you, [tearing up] thank you, thank you.",Toby
"I know, right. Merry Christmas.",Darryl
Oh thanks. She's gonna... [notices the doll is black] oh...,Toby
Something wrong with the doll?,Darryl
No. It's even-- it's even better than the one I wanted.,Toby
Sunrise Rehab? No! No! No! I told you no! There is no way!,Meredith
It's okay. It's all right.,Michael
No way! There is no way! No way!,Meredith
"Meredith, we are doing this for your own good. Okay. Come on--",Michael
No way! No way! There is no way!,Meredith
Here we go. This is gonna be good.,Michael
No! No way! I told you. We talked about this. There is absolutely no way. No! No! There is no way! No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!,Meredith
Yes you are. [tries to pull Meredith from the car],Michael
I am not going in there! NO!!,Meredith
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!,Meredith
Shhh... just calm down.,Michael
[runs away] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! No! No!,Meredith
[chasing Meredith] Come on. Shh...,Michael
No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!,Meredith
Here's the door. Here's the door.,Michael
There is no way! There is no way! No! No!,Meredith
[dragging Meredith on the floor into the rehab center] Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you?,Michael
This man is crazy! This man is crazy!,Meredith
Can I help you?,Rehab Nurse
I have a deposit. Alcoholic.,Michael
No! No! No! No! No!,Meredith
So do I sign?,Michael
NO!!!,Meredith
I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.,Phyllis
It's outside.,Angela
I didn't ask you where it was. I told you where it needs to be.,Phyllis
Shut up.,Angela
Excuse me?,Phyllis
"I'm not moving the tree. Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell. And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.",Angela
"Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight. I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.",Phyllis
Well don't look so surprised.,Dwight
I knew it.,Pam
You did not know it.,Jim
I knew some of it.,Pam
Everyone knew some of it.,Jim
It's Christmas.,Pam
You knew it.,Jim
Thank you. I knew it.,Pam
She knew it.,Jim
As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will. They have to do it voluntarily. They have to hit rock bottom. So I think I know what I need to do at this point. I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom. Um... I think I can do it. I did it with Jan.,Michael
"All right, everybody's still here. Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on. Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer. [sings] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA. Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo. [laughs]",Andy
I think I'd like to go home now.,Angela
"Sure. Dooo. Tough room. [chuckles] Come on. I just learned it. Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.",Andy
"[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?",Pam
"[heard yelling from the street] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!",Michael
"Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.",Pam
[yelling as he runs past the radar gun] Aah!,Dwight
"Wow, thirteen!",Phyllis
Yes!,Dwight
"No. No, no. There was wind.",Michael
I was just jogging.,Dwight
"Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.",Michael
"No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.",Jim
I want another try. Here we go! [Michael runs past the radar as a car passes] Thirty-one! Thirty-one!,Michael
There was a car.,Stanley
I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.,Michael
Thirty-one is humanly impossible.,Oscar
"Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number.",Michael
That's impossible.,Oscar
Beat it!,Michael
"Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by [in an authoritative voice] Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. [in normal voice] He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.",Michael
"Quick announcement: new year, new candy.",Pam
Whoo-hoo!,Kevin
"Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.",Pam
Hot tamales.,Kevin
Yeah.,Pam
Uh oh.,Kevin
"So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more...",Pam
"[entering the office] Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just... [sighs] No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.",Andy
"Wait, you still don't know...",Michael
"[getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.",Jim
Hmm?,Andy
Nothing.,Jim
You still don't know.,Michael
Why don't... Let's...,Jim
[to Jim] What are you doing?,Michael
How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...,Jim
Andy.,Michael
Ahh! [ushers Michael into his office],Jim
"No, no one has RSVP'ed, and I don't understand it, and now, you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you.",Andy
"[from inside his office] No, what I'm saying is...",Michael
"No, no.",Jim
"No, that's not it.",Michael
I know.,Jim
"Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.",Jim
[sighs] How can he still not know?,Michael
We can't figure that out.,Jim
I can't take it anymore.,Michael
"Wait, what? You can't take what?",Dwight
I am telling Andy.,Michael
No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.,Dwight
"Who should it come from, then?",Michael
[simultaneously] Angela.,Everyone
[to Dwight] Are you still having intercourse with her? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes'],Michael
What is wrong with you? She is engaged.,Oscar
Did you ever have intercourse in this office? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes'],Michael
"Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight?",Oscar
[coolly] Seems like you already know where.,Dwight
"Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.",Angela
"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away.",Kevin
That's enough.,Angela
"Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What?",Kevin
"That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form.",Oscar
"How about, 'I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?'",Kevin
There you go.,Oscar
"[on the phone] That cannot be true! [Dwight jumps] You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself...",Andy
[whispering to Jim] Trade seats with me.,Dwight
No.,Jim
I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.,Dwight
Please stop.,Jim
[grabs a spoon from Jim's coffee cup and checks behind him with it] I need a soup spoon.,Dwight
"Rule 17: don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. [sings] Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep. [makes chomping sound]",Dwight
[moves his bobblehead from one side of his nameplate to the other and clears his throat to get Angela's attention],Dwight
What is it?,Angela
You've got to tell Andy about us.,Dwight
That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.,Angela
Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.,Dwight
You're expanding on your worst idea.,Angela
Do you love me or not?,Dwight
I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?,Angela
Because you're engaged to Andy.,Dwight
[sighs],Angela
Well?,Michael
Not yet.,Dwight
When?,Jim
When what? [clears throat] When what?,Andy
You know this can't go on.,Michael
What can't go on?,Andy
We have to put an end to this.,Michael
Seems like...,Andy
Come on. [Dwight and Jim follow into Michael's office],Michael
You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying.,Andy
This is really not how this is supposed to happen.,Jim
Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.,Dwight
When will she be ready?,Michael
I don't know.,Dwight
Is she crazy in bed?,Michael
[boastfully] Yes.,Dwight
Stop. What?,Jim
"How so, specifically?",Michael
"Okay, listen.",Jim
Eager.,Dwight
This shouldn't happen at work.,Jim
And flexible.,Dwight
And!,Jim
Really?,Michael
This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.,Jim
It's too late.,Michael
"Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.",Jim
I am already walking.,Michael
"Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down.",Dwight
"Okay, what does that mean?",Michael
Might get ugly.,Dwight
"[sighs] Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.",Michael
But you're leaving...,Jim
"[to Michael, who opens the door to leave] Have a good trip.",Dwight
Thanks. [to Andy] Andy?,Michael
Yeah.,Andy
Walk with me.,Michael
"Will do, boss-man.",Andy
"Ohh, I do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn't want to hear...",Michael
You're not making any sense.,Andy
"Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day.",Michael
All righty.,Andy
Which will be fine. I am off!,Michael
Have a good meeting!,Andy
Thank you! [gets into his car],Michael
[through the car window] Kick Wallace's ass!,Andy
"[through the car window] Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...",Michael
I can't hear you through the glass,Andy
[rolls down car window] Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.,Michael
What?,Andy
All right. See you later. [backs out of the parking space] Ahh.,Michael
Are you serious?,Andy
Yep. [drives off],Michael
I knew something bad was gonna happen today.,Meredith
You said that yesterday.,Oscar
"Yeah, my neighbor got murdered.",Meredith
[to Dwight] What are you standing for?,Jim
"If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin.",Dwight
You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.,Jim
"If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to.",Dwight
"Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit...",Jim
[enters the office and walks to Angela] I need to talk to you.,Andy
We can talk right here.,Angela
I need to talk to you in private.,Andy
We're not listening.,Kevin
Let's go to the conference room.,Andy
Is it true?,Andy
What have you heard?,Angela
That you're sleeping with Dwight.,Andy
That doesn't sound like me.,Angela
Is it true?,Andy
"Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake...",Angela
Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?,Andy
A little bit.,Angela
How long has it been going on?,Andy
"I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again.",Angela
Who else knows about it?,Andy
Michael.,Angela
Who else?,Andy
"[quietly] Let me think about it... I, um... there... [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them]",Angela
Oh God. Come on!,Andy
"So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don't know exactly how to put this, but... what are you doing right?",David
Right what?,Michael
"Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers. [Michael smiles] Look, you're not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing... is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is.",David
"David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever.",Michael
"Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.",Michael
"This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler.",Michael
"Here's the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It's not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It's Hail Mary time.",David
"[pokes his head in] Hey, what say we order up some pasta?",Michael
What say we do.,David
"Standard, you know? Nothing fancy.",Angela
"So like, missionary...",Andy
I said nothing fancy.,Angela
Do you love him?,Andy
I love you.,Angela
Why should I believe that?,Andy
"Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together.",Angela
Who says that?,Andy
"Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong.",Angela
Where's Dwight?,Andy
"You okay, man?",Jim
"No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time.",Andy
You are welcome.,Creed
[Dwight enters] Dwight.,Andy
Andy.,Dwight
It's over.,Andy
Oh good. She broke up with you.,Dwight
No. It's over between you two.,Andy
"Uh, no way. I am not giving up.",Dwight
You have to.,Andy
No I don't.,Dwight
[forcefully] She doesn't love you. She's marrying me.,Andy
"[angrier] Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.",Dwight
Angela Bernard.,Andy
Will never be her name.,Dwight
It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!,Andy
I don't think so.,Dwight
"Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?",Jim
I'm telling you to back down.,Andy
And I'm telling you that I will never back down.,Dwight
Then I'll make you.,Andy
Oh really? How are you gonna do that?,Dwight
Through the use of force.,Andy
"That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.",Dwight
I will fight you.,Andy
Nope.,Jim
"Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.",Dwight
Fine!,Andy
Fine!,Dwight
This is nuts.,Oscar
What is your weapon?,Dwight
"Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because...",Jim
"Hey, this is none of your business.",Dwight
Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.,Jim
Guess what? Not happening at work.,Andy
Yes!,Dwight
We're gonna do it outside.,Andy
Outside of work.,Dwight
None of your business.,Andy
None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what weapon?,Dwight
My bare hands.,Andy
That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.,Dwight
Then I'll get something too.,Andy
I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder.,Meredith
"Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.",Pam
[thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel.,Angela
Of course you will.,Pam
I call loser!,Meredith
I will be taking my break at 4:00 in the parking lot.,Andy
I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.,Dwight
[softly] What a coincidence.,Andy
Mm.,Dwight
"So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.",Jim
[collects Dwight's weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe],Jim
[innocently] How'd that get there?,Dwight
There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.,Meredith
Thanks Meredith.,Jim
"So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, 'Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?' And he looks at me and he says, 'Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket.' And I look back at him and I say, 'I feel the need!... The need for tweed.'",Michael
"It's hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying. [gets up] And thanks for coming in.",David
"[rises] Oh, thank you.",Michael
Yes.,David
"I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.",Michael
Yeah.,David
Okay. [sits back down to continue eating],Michael
"[opens his office door] Yeah, finish up.",David
[shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!,Dwight
[watching from the conference room] I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.,Angela
I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.,Kelly
Come on!,Dwight
"Hey, has anything happened yet?",Meredith
Where are you?,Dwight
"Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show.",Oscar
"Oh come on, man! Believe in something.",Kevin
"Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... [spots a note attached to the bushes; goes to read it] 'From the desk of Andrew Bernard.' [scoffs] A note. Pathetic. 'Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested.' True. 'The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly...' [as Dwight continues to read, Andy drives around the corner very slowly]",Dwight
"There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?",Kelly
Why isn't Dwight turning around?,Phyllis
The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.,Oscar
Yeah.,Creed
"[still reading] Alas, after much consideration and deliberation...",Dwight
Oh my God!,Pam
What's happening?,Stanley
Andy's running over Dwight with his car.,Phyllis
Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey!,Dwight
Yeah.,Andy
Oh!,Everyone watching
Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah!,Dwight
You give up?,Andy
Never! [hits Andy's car with his bike chain] Get out and face me like a man!,Dwight
I am a man! I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiance!,Andy
You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] 'La la la la la la la la la la!' What does that mean? You can't even protect her!,Dwight
"Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?",Andy
"Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain]",Dwight
Dwight! Are your legs broken?,Jim
No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.,Dwight
"Andy, are you all right?",Jim
"Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this!",Andy
"Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain]",Dwight
"What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.",Andy
I sa- [Andy honks his horn],Dwight
"What? You stupid idiot! [Andy honks his horn] You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods...",Andy
"Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!",Dwight
I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?,Andy
What?,Dwight
What!,Andy
She's sleeping with you?,Dwight
I'm her fiance.,Andy
She said she was only sleeping with me.,Dwight
"[enters, followed by Dwight, and makes a call] Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat... Yep, that's the one.",Andy
[picks up his bobblehead and throws it in the trash can],Dwight
Thank you. [hangs up],Andy
"Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. [sighs] Ahh!",Michael
"[as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow; Jim catches him and he hands it over]",Dwight
What's this?,Dwight
Looks like a red wire.,Jim
Hmm. It wasn't here before.,Dwight
"Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.",Jim
Yours doesn't.,Dwight
Doesn't it?,Jim
"No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.",Dwight
"Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore. [Dwight follows red cord through office past Phyllis' and Stanley's desks]",Jim
"Dwight, get out of here!",Phyllis
What are you doing?,Stanley
"I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. [behind Jim, Dwight climbs telephone pole] Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there.",Jim
"What you talking bout, Wallace? [imitating What you talking bout Willis]",Michael
Hi Michael how are you?,David
"Hi, I am well, how are you?",Michael
"So listen, as you know, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job.",David
"Oh, have you not?",Michael
"Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor [Michael makes exaggerated oh-my-gosh face at camera]. There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business.",David
Yeah.,Michael
"There is a small company there, Prince Paper. I can't get a report on it because it's not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me.",David
Okay.,Michael
I'll fax over some of the things we're looking for.,David
"Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?",Michael
"Look, this is important, Michael.",David
"Oh, well, then, email it to me.",Michael
You've got no taste Stanley Hudson.,Phyllis
"Oh, I do.",Stanley
What are you guys talking about?,Andy
"Some actress, whether shes hot.",Stanley
Who is the gal in question?,Andy
Hillary Swank.,Phyllis
"Ah, Hillary Swank.",Creed
"[most of office huddles around print out of Hillary Swank, judging her hotness] Not at all.",Kevin
She's got mean eyes.,Meredith
Have you seen her with her bangs?,Pam
She looks like a monster.,Kevin
"Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.",Jim
She is an amazing actress.,Meredith
That is not the question.,Kevin
She's not hot.,Phyllis
"Yeah, thank you Phyllis.",Kevin
"Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.",Jim
I'm not voting.,Angela
"[snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. [half of office raises hand] Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. [other half of office raises hand]",Jim
[counting votes] Five. Five to five.,Kevin
"Thank you, accounting department.",Jim
So what do we do now?,Kevin
[riding in car with Michael] What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?,Dwight
I will seduce her.,Michael
"No, I wanna seduce her.",Dwight
"No, I will seduce her.",Michael
"Please Michael, please.",Dwight
"No, I got it.",Michael
You'll fall in love with her.,Dwight
"Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.",Michael
"Okay, let's go over the plan again.",Dwight
"Alright, I am a local business owner. [Dwight nods along] I need to buy paper. I find out everything about their prices and policies",Michael
Your fictitious name?,Dwight
Michael Scarn.,Michael
I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.,Dwight
Okay.,Michael
Then we meet at the Denny's...,Dwight
[interrupting] No.,Michael
...and then we compare notes.,Dwight
"No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP.",Michael
No! [arguing over each other],Dwight
You know how I feel about IHOP.,Dwight
"Oh, don't start,",Michael
Are you socialist?,Dwight
You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.,Michael
I'll have a cup of a coffee.,Dwight
You will have pancakes and you'll like it.,Michael
Store only has three employees.,Dwight
So what?,Michael
It means they are not expanding.,Dwight
Maybe they are shrinking.,Michael
No.,Dwight
They could be shrinking.,Michael
No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.,Dwight
Ah ha [popping something in his mouth] Yup.,Michael
"[spying through binoculars] Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.",Dwight
Mm hmm .,Michael
Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.,Dwight
"And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.",Michael
"Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.",Dwight
"Argh, why are you all...",Michael
Get your clouds right.,Dwight
Shut up.,Michael
"So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. [Michael licks lips] No, no like this. [Dwight starts and Michael follows passionately licking their lips] Good.",Dwight
Ready to do this?,Michael
Yeah.,Dwight
Good. Here come the sharks. [they imitate jaws theme sounds and Dwight makes shark fin on his forehead],Michael
"In nature, there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.",Michael
Hello.,Michael
"Hello, hi.",Entire Prince family
My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.,Michael
"Oh, please come in",Prince Grandfather
Thank you.,Michael
What kind of business are you in.,Prince Grandfather
We are a law firm.,Michael
"I assume your primary paper needs are stationary, general office.",Prince Grandfather
"You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question [reaches for paper in his pocket with questions on it] for you would be [reading off sheet] how many clients do you have?",Michael
About 80.,Prince Grandfather
Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation.,Michael
"It's just me, my wife and my son.",Prince Grandfather
"Ah, so when did you set up shop?",Michael
I opened this place after I came back from Vietnam.,Prince Grandfather
"Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely .",Michael
[muted] Mmhmm. [shrugs],Prince Grandfather
Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic: Hillary Swank is attractive.,Andy
Hot!,Entire office
The debate is whether she is hot.,Kevin
"What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here.",Stanley
"Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting.",Kevin
"Okay, TMI.",Andy
"So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?",Michael
You sure know a lot about paper for a lawyer.,Prince Grandfather
Well that is... because... I am a genius.,Michael
Oh really?,Prince Grandfather
"Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? [picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion] Is this the cup? [picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion] Is this what I drink out of? [glug noise, both laugh] Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.",Michael
"Hello, I would like to apply for a job.",Dwight
"Hi, I'm afraid we're not hiring right now.",Prince Grandfather
Why don't you just get rid of this guy? [points to Prince Son],Dwight
That's my son.,Prince Grandfather
"I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin. I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?",Dwight
Try 80.,Michael
"Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.",Dwight
I sure hope not.,Prince Grandfather
Me too. [smirking],Dwight
"I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.",Jim
"Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.",Kevin
"Kevin, c'mon.",Oscar
"Yeah, shut up Kevin.",Kelly
"He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing.",Kevin
"Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the 'hot' team to their great joy] Does that end the debate?",Jim
"[Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to 'not hot' team] No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.",Kevin
Oh my God.,Angela
[fingers opened an inch] This close.,Jim
Grandfather: So why are you considering leaving Dunder Mifflin?,Prince
"My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. [Michael takes offense and charges over]",Dwight
"Hey, hey, how is your interview going?",Michael
It's going very well.,Dwight
"Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?",Michael
You want a picture of me?,Linda
"I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great [positioning her towards sign of Prince Family Paper customers] Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left [positions Linda to get better picture]",Michael
Can I get a copy of that?,Linda
"Grandma, I can't do this.",Prince Granddaughter
"What's going on? Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?",Michael
Right.,Prince Granddaughter
"Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?",Michael
8,Prince Granddaughter
Excellent! Way to go! Nice! [Michael and granddaughter Prince exchange high fives],Michael
Don't put that. [granddaughter Prince erases and corrects answer],Prince Grandmother
"Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.",Kevin
[disapprovingly] Kevin!,Pam
"Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker.",Angela
OH! [the 'yes she's hot team' claps],Jim
"Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. It's going to be an incredibly hard decision.",Michael
"Wait; let me get something for you. Here is some, some references. Here is a list of references, our top clients. You call any of them; I trust you will hear some good things.",Prince Grandfather
"I... Okay, okay, okay, [in disbelief] alright, thank you. [heads towards Dwight, makes make out lips signal]",Michael
"[both making make out lips at each other] Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.",Dwight
Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.,Michael
Thank you very much.,Dwight
I cannot wait to contact your clients.,Michael
Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. [hurrying out door],Dwight
Bye bye now. So long.,Prince Grandfather
"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. [running out door]",Dwight and Michael
"Haha, we struck the mother load!",Michael
Cmon.,Dwight
Wallace is going to freak.,Michael
All their top clients I can't believe it.,Dwight
He's going to absolutely freak.,Michael
"Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. [car hits front divider, screeching]",Dwight
Oh shoot.,Michael
"You drove over that. Go back [car hits divider, screeching]",Dwight
"Oh God, what was that?",Michael
That's not good.,Dwight
"No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears]",Kelly
Oh my God.,Dwight
"Aw, it's alright.",Michael
"Oh man,",Dwight
"Aw, my car.",Michael
Not good.,Dwight
Is everyone okay?,Prince Grandfather
It sounded bad.,Prince Grandmother
Yeah.,Dwight
"No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.",Michael
You've done more then you can possibly know.,Dwight
"Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so...",Michael
A tow truck is going to charge you one hundred bucks to take you a mile. Let me take a look.,Prince Grandfather
"No, no, really not necessary.",Michael
He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..,Dwight
I'll be right back I'm just going to grab my tool box.,Prince Grandfather
"Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access.",Pam
"[surprised] Wait, what?",Kevin
"See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.",Oscar
How much longer is this going to take?,Dwight
You know let me give you some money for this.,Michael
"No, I work at a desk all day, its nice working with my hands.",Prince Son
"Oh coffee, that's too much. [Dwight drinks it]",Michael
"This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?",Dwight
Well that outta do it. [bumper is heavily duct taped to the car],Prince Grandfather
Its all better.,Prince Granddaughter
Thank you.,Michael
"Gosh, well so long. [they exchange byes]",Prince Grandfather
I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.,Dwight
"Ok, goodbye Prince Family.",Michael
"Goodbye prince family, [to Michael] should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. [Dwight laughs evilly, Michael seems remorseful] Bye bye.",Dwight
"[punches Michael on the arm, beckons to Michael for high five, does not get it, high fives himself, smiles contently]",Dwight
"[entire office is chatting] I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying.",Jim
"No, because... [Dwight and Michael walk in and march into Michael's office, silencing the conversation]",Pam
"Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?",Michael
"Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.",Dwight
"Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine.",Michael
They could do better.,Dwight
"Why don't we just, live and let live?",Michael
What?,Dwight
Live and let live.,Michael
"I'm not familiar with that expression,",Dwight
It's from James Bond.,Michael
"It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive.",Dwight
I'm not going to make this call.,Michael
"Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate? Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?",Dwight
My heart says...,Michael
"Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.",Dwight
That is true.,Michael
Yes.,Dwight
That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.,Michael
Yeah.,Dwight
Jan... Ryan.,Michael
"Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.",Dwight
"I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot.",Stanley
"There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.",Dwight
You're right.,Michael
Yeah.,Dwight
You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.,Michael
"Good, so, [Michael takes client list and heads out of office] where are you going?",Dwight
Just something I have to do first.,Michael
Where are you taking the client list?,Dwight
"Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone [starts running, Dwight follows]",Michael
"Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No. [chasing Michael out of the office into parking lot]",Dwight
Oh shoot! [gets to his car turns around],Michael
"Freeze, give me the list! [still chasing him back into office where Michael grabs his car keys from his desk and heads back to parking lot]",Dwight
"No no no, I can't let you do this!",Dwight
Those people will be ruined. [runs out back door],Michael
"Its business, not personal. [they run back outside, where Dwight gets paper from Michael]",Dwight
"Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people.",Michael
"Its over, Michael, its over. [holding list of clients up]",Dwight
Im not a shark.,Michael
"Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot? [half of office raises hand] Okay. And all those opposed? [he skips back and joins other half of office in raising hand]",Andy
This is ridiculous.,Kevin
"That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. [two sides of the debate start arguing]",Oscar
This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal.,David
[pained] Mpfh.,Michael
Good work.,David
Thank you.,Michael
"Look I'll be in touch, thanks buddy.",David
"Okay, bye bye.",Michael
"Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?",Dwight
I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?,Michael
"Oh, hey what is this?",Michael
Hillary swank.,Pam
"Oh, she is hot. ['Hillary Swank is hot' supporters cheer]",Michael
"Last week I gave a fire safety talk. [clears throat] And nobody paid any attention. It's my own fault for using PowerPoint. PowerPoint is boring. People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher. [lights a cigarette] Today, smoking is gonna save lives. [throws cigarette into garbage can filled with paper and lighter fluid]",Dwight
[looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke] Does anyone smell anything smoky?,Dwight
Did you bring your jerky in again?,Angela
[clears throat],Dwight
"[points to smoke] Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!",Pam
What--,Phyllis
"Whoa, fire!",Andy
"Oh, fire! Oh my goodness! What's the procedure? What do we do, people?",Dwight
The phones are dead.,Pam
"Oh, how did that happen?",Dwight
It's out in the hall.,Kevin
"No, we don't know that. The smoke could be coming through an air duct.",Dwight
"Oh my God! Okay, it happening. Everybody stay calm.",Michael
"What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?",Dwight
Stay [bleep] calm!,Michael
"Wait, wait, wait.",Dwight
"Everyone, now [bleep] calm down!",Michael
"No! No, Michael! No! Touch the handle. If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.",Dwight
What does warm mean?,Michael
[groaning] Oh my God.,Everyone
Not a viable option.,Dwight
Try a different door.,Pam
"Okay, what's next?",Dwight
Don't run.,Michael
Oh! Here's a door. Check that one out. How's the handle?,Dwight
It-- it's warm.,Andy
"Well, uh, another option. [everyone chattering at once]",Dwight
Back door.,Jim
Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone. No bunching!,Dwight
Oh! I forgot my purse.,Phyllis
Leave it woman!,Stanley
"Get out of the way! Go, go, go!",Michael
"Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...",Dwight
Ah! My hand! That's hot!,Oscar
Aah! This ones hot too!,Andy
"Okay, we're trapped. Everyone for himself.",Michael
"Okay, let's go.",Dwight
[shouting] Out of my way! Let's go. Get out of my way!,Everyone
"Calm, please",Dwight
Get out of the way!,Andy
Have you ever seen a burn victim?,Dwight
Move it!,Andy
"Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options. Where do we go folks? Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?",Dwight
[pulling cat out of filing drawer] It's okay. Shh shhh.,Angela
"A what? A rag. A damp rag, perhaps. Let's remember those procedures. What are the options? Okay, that's the wrong way. We've already tried that. Remember your exit points. Exit points people.",Dwight
Oscar.,Angela
What's next?,Dwight
Oscar!,Angela
Stay alive! I'm getting help!,Oscar
Pull me up!,Angela
You're too heavy!,Oscar
I only weigh 82 pounds! Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh!,Angela
"How about 911? Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.]",Dwight
What do we do?,Pam
Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.,Dwight
"Okay, I am not dying here. Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]",Jim
What is that? What is that?,Angela
The fire's shooting at us!,Andy
What in the name of God is going on?!,Phyllis
"Yes! [Dwight pulls fire alarm] Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!",Andy
Ahhhh!!! [Oscar's leg crashes through the ceiling],Phyllis and Creed
"Go, go, go, go, go!! [Andy and Jim ram the door with the copy machine]",Andy
[throws the projector out the window] Help!! Help!!,Michael
I'm about to die!,Stanley
[blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin! This has been a test of our emergency preparedness. There is no fire. It was only a simulation.,Dwight
What?!,Jim
"Fire not real. This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor] Oh come on. It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.",Dwight
"No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president! You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth.",Michael
"No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!",Jim
He's going to swallow is tongue.,Michael
No. Michael. Michael.,Jim
Open your mouth. Come on. Don't swallow it.,Michael
[everyone shouting at once] Michael! Michael!,Jim
Leave me al--,Michael
You're choking him!,Andy
Saving him!,Michael
How could you possibly think this is a good idea?,David Wallace
A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.,Dwight
Electricity.,Michael
Shampoo.,Dwight
You could have burned down the whole building.,David Wallace
"I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone. Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.",Dwight
"Did you shout, 'Fire!', causing a panic?",Lawyer
"Yes I shouted 'fire!'. I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--",Dwight
Hed. Hedded,Michael
When no one hedded--,Dwight
Take hedded of.,Michael
N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.,Dwight
Heed. Heed.,Michael
"So, you--",Dwight
Take heed of.,Michael
"And, well, I don't see my co-workers--",Dwight
Take heed of.,Michael
Hee-heeding this right now.,Dwight
Wh--what?,Lawyer
"Okay. [walks to the window, sighs] This city. Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed.",Michael
"No, we are mad.",David Wallace
Yes. We are. We are livid. But we are going to let this one slide.,Michael
"No, we're not.",David Wallace
"I am not a mind reader, David.",Michael
"Look, this is very serious offense. We have cause to fire you.",David
"Can you shove down? Instead... shove down, please. Instead, what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer.",Michel
No.,Dwight
And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice. Something that Dwight doesn't like.,Michael
PETA.,Dwight
"Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack. He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run. Do you want that on your conscious?",David Wallace
Do you?,Michael
Michael?,David Wallace
You talking to me?,Michael
Yeah.,David Wallace
What?,Michael
Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?,Dwight
"[sighs] No, Dwight. I am worried. A man's life is in my hands.",Michael
Don't you worry about that. I got it covered. Okay?,Dwight
Yeah.,Michael
I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.,Dwight
That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man.,Michael
What? You?,Dwight
Yes.,Michael
Come on.,Dwight
I'm a smart guy. I'll figure it out.,Michael
That's preposterous.,Dwight
"No, I will.",Michael
"Nobody should have to go to work thinking, 'Oh, this is the place that I might die today.' That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying. An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true.",Michael
"Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable. [whispering] Welcome back, Stanley.",Michael
"Thank you, Michael.",Stanley
"It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people...",Stanley
[flashback] Not maybe. Yes or no.,Stanley
[flashback] No way. Uh-uh.,Stanley
[flashback] Are you from another planet?,Stanley
"[flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it.",Stanley
[flashback] Did I stutter?,Stanley
[flashback] I'm done. Goodbye.,Stanley
But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die.,Stanley
Andy.,Michael
[in a British accent] A throne for your highness.,Andy
I'm not sitting in a wheelchair.,Stanley
"No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.",Michael
I'm going to die.,Stanley
"A-B-C. Okay? And hat stands for... airway, breathing and circulation.",CPR trainer
"Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means 'always be closing.'",Michael
This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.,Dwight
Shut it. Shut it.,Michael
"We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do. So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket.",Michael
[giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I can't keep doing this forever.,Kevin
It's been 20 seconds.,CPR Trainer
Call it.,Kevin
Would you like to try next?,CPR Trainer
Absolutely I would not.,Dwight
You know who I really think should go? Stanley.,Michael
"Oh, I don't know.",Stanley
"That's not a good idea, Michael.",Phyllis
Come on.,Michael
He needs to rest.,Phyllis
No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working. What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?,Michael
I would die.,Stanley
And you're okay with that?,Michael
I'm okay with the logic of it.,Stanley
"Uh-uh. No, no, no. Come on. Get up. Let's do this.",Michael
"Yes. I had a heart attack. I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire. I feel like I'm working in my own casket.",Stanley
Come on Stanley. You're losing you. You're losing you. Do it!,Michael
Michael!,Angela
This is you we're talking about.,Michael
Michael.,Angela
"Okay, okay. I'll show them. Here we go. [whispers] Stanley. All right.",Michael
"So, assessing the situation. Are they breathing?",CPR Trainer
"No, Rose. They are not breathing. And they have no arms or legs.",Michael
"No, that's not part of it.",Rose
"Where are they? You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?",Michael
I would want to live with no legs.,Kevin
"How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.",Michael
"All right, well, lets get back to it. 'Cause you're losing him. Okay, too fast. Everyone, we need to pump at a pace of a 100 beats per minute .",Rose
"okay, that's uh, hard to keep track. How many is that per hour?",Michael
How's that gonna help you?,Jim
I will divide and then count to it.,Michael
Right.,Jim
"Okay. Well, a good trick is to pump to the tune of 'Staying Alive' by the Bee Gees. Do you know that song?",Rose
"Yes, yes I do. I love that song. [clears throat, begins to sing] First I was afraid, I was petrified.",Michael
"No, it's--Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.",Rose
"Okay, I got it.",Michael
[to Rose] You were in the parking lot earlier. That's how I know you.,Creed
"Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive [Andy joins in] Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.",Michael
"Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah...",Michael
"Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay, [Michael and Kelly join in] you can look the other way. Loo do do!",Andy
Okay!,Rose
"Da, da, da, da, da, da, da",Andy
Okay!,Rose
"[muttering] Stayin' alive, stayin' alive.",Everyone
"Yeah, okay. You didn't maintain 100 beats per minute, and the ambulance didn't arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him.",Rose
"Okay, he's dead. Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?",Dwight
I have no idea.,Rose
Anyone else?,Dwight
We bury him?,Phyllis
"Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card. If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.",Dwight
"He has no wallet, I checked.",Creed
He is an organ donor.,Michael
He is.,Dwight
Yeah.,Michael
Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out knife from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go.,Dwight
Oh my God! Dwight!,Angela
Dwight!,Kelly
What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing?,Angela
We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.,Dwight
I'm not feeling well. I need to sit down.,Stanley
"Hey, Stanley.",Michael
Stanley.,Andy
Are you okay?,Michael
Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own],Angela
Oh my God!,Stanley
Dwight!,Angela
Clarice?,Dwight
Oh my God!,Stanley
Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?,David Wallace
"I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.",Dwight
We had to pay for it. Cost us thirty five hundred dollars.,David Wallace
Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?,Michael
Wow.,Dwight
"Okay, look. David, this is why we have training. We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.",Michael
"Hope you brought your appetitos. My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. [dumps popcorn in bowl, it's almost all seeds] Uh, damn it. This movie, a lot of buzz. Not coming out for another six months. Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges.",Andy
"We don't normally download films illegally. Because we're honest, hardworking people.",Pam
And we don't know how.,Jim
"But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.",Pam
Punishment fits the crime.,Jim
[movie] I want you to meet my nana. Nana...,Jessica Alba
Mmmhmm...,Lily
This is Sam.,Jessica Alba
Hi. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hannaday.,Sam
Please-- Call me Lily. [light chuckle] Let's play Bridge. You can be my partner.,Lily
Alright... Lily.,Sam
[after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on?,Jim
"Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.",Jim
My dad spent the night at our place last night. My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks. Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe.,Pam
He's not saying what he needs to say.,Pam
Hmm? Who? Sam?,Andy
Yeah.,Pam
"I mean, they just need to communicate, you know? If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--",Jim
Hmm.,Andy
"Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head.",Andy
"Hi, everyone. Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?",Michael
I have.,Dwight
Let's hear it.,Michael
[clears throat] 'I state my regret.',Dwight
You couldn't of memorized that?,Jim
"I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it. Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.",Dwight
It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.,Phyllis
"Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay? Make a line. Just form a line right here. Sign it! Sign it now!",Dwight
"Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.",Pam
[movie] I'm in here.,Lily
"I uh, I'm sorry I didn't uh, realize you were in a bath. Do you want me to go?",Sam
I want you to stay.,Lily
Gimme a break.,Jim
"I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie's mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite.",Andy
[movie] Get that in there. Oh yeah.,Sam
Get that done already.,Lily
I know but if I get it in deeper...,Sam
[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.,Jim
"Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?",Andy
So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?,Pam
"You guys, they're making out.",Andy
Hey.,Pam
Hey.,Jim
"Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?",Pam
"Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.",Jim
[sighs],Pam
What?,Jim
"I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it.",Pam
Mmm...,Jim
You're good to talk to.,Pam
"[laughs] I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um... [nods]",Jim
[in a monk-impression tone] Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me. [Meredtih sits Indian style in a dress exposing herself right in front of Michael] Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm...,Michael
My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds. [a couple of sounds play on the computer] That one makes me think... of death. It's kinda nice...,Michael
"[everyone is lying on the floor in the conference room with the light off, Michael is walking around with a candle in his hand] It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.",Michael
Don't open your eyes.,Jim
"What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh...",Pam
"And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.",Michael
Chunky monkey.,Meredith
Too expensive.,Michael
Chocolate.,Stanley
"Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want? [beeping starts] What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.",Michael
It's my bio-feedback machine..,Stanley
"Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?",Michael
It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.,Stanley
You have stress?,Michael
Yes...,Stanley
During our relaxation exercise?,Michael
Let me get you some water.,Phyllis
"No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go.",Michael
"No, Michael, No. [beeping speeds up]",Stanley
Let me getcha.,Michael
"Would ya, would ya step back please",Stanley
"Ok, alright.",Michael
Please. A little further.,Stanley
Ok. [beeping slows down],Michael
That's better. [Michael walks back towards Stanley and the beeping goes up again],Stanley
"Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay? [Oscar has Stanley's monitor now] Let's give this a shot.",Michael
Hellloo... [beeping speeds up as Michael gets closer],Michael
"Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.",Kevin
So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer... it's uh... great twist. Great twist.,Michael
"Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?",Pam
What did you say to my dad?,Pam
What?,Jim
"After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.",Pam
"Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away]",Jim
"Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...",Jim
What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?,Pam
I don't get it. Do I stress you out?,Michael
Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.,Dwight
Oh...,Michael
Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology],Dwight
"Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.",Michael
"Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think. [Jim shakes his head at the camera] You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short...",Michael
A vacation.,Kelly
"What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other...",Michael
Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?,Oscar
Si senor.,Michael
That's offensive.,Oscar
"It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.",Michael
[giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...,Kevin
I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.,Oscar
I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.,Michael
"May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.",Dwight
"Hey, this is your apology letter.",Phyllis
That was the last signature I needed.,Dwight
"Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left. [Creed looks around] So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may. [Angela jumps up] Ok... lower the mic for the midget.",Michael
"If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter]",Angela
I normally don't enjoy making people laugh. [grin],Angela
If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...,Angela
Michael Scott! [laughter],Group
"Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!",Michael
"I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.",Kelly
You're so lucky! Good one... [clapping],Michael
Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said 'Gross'...,Meredith
Well...,Michael
"Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.",Meredith
"Pow pow pow... [hands making gunshot impression, sporadic clapping]",Michael
[yelling at Michael in Spanish],Oscar
"[Toby tries to come on stage] NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY. [Toby shrugs and sits back down]",Michael
"Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.",Jim
I know where this is goin'.,Michael
Do ya?,Jim
No...,Michael
Ok. Remember Spider face?,Jim
No.,Michael
"OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.",Jim
Spite her - ok [laughter],Michael
Yeah... yep.,Jim
How dare you all attack him like this.,Dwight
"Oh, stop it Dwight.",Michael
Michael is your superior.,Dwight
No no no no no no!,Michael
"Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.",Dwight
Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way.,Michael
"Ok, no, they don't understand who they have...",Dwight
"That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot.",Michael
You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.,Dwight
Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.,Michael
Are you calling me an idiot?,Dwight
Idiot.,Michael
"Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land. [clapping and whooing]",Dwight
"Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. [laughter] He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.",Pam
"Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?",Michael
"Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]",Pam
"Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.",Michael
"Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?",Darryl
"We are, we are a family.",Michael
"Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.",Darryl
Oh very funny.,Michael
What's his name?,Darryl
Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy?,Michael
Roy left years ago. What's his name?,Darryl
I don't believe I have had the pleasure.,Michael
"Michael I gave you a ride home last week, we spent an hour in traffic...",Warehouse Michael
What's,Darryl
Jefferson.,Michael
Nope. His name is Michael. [Michael makes the da dum ksch on the drumset again],Darryl
"[singing and playing the guitar] What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, you're the laziest, jerkiest and you're dumber than applesauce. We're stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well it's true. That's what I hate about you. That's what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott.",Andy
"Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. [clears throat] Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight. [clears throat again] So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought [choking up, clears throat again] sorry. [laughs nervously] I think I have a frog in my throat. Um... [sigh] I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um... [Michael walks off stage, knocking over the snare drum]",Michael
"Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.",Pam
"It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.",Dwight
"[in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles]",Kevin
Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.,Oscar
I'm almost done.,Kevin
"That reeks, and I'm trying to eat.",Oscar
Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?,Dwight
Yep. You're being replaced.,Jim
I think he meant personal day.,Pam
"Oh, that's quite a leap Pam.",Dwight
"I hope he's ok, I feel bad.",Phyllis
"Give it up, he's dead.",Creed
He just sent a text...,Jim
What's a text?,Creed
[at a park throwing whole pieces of bread] Caw... caw... caw caw... caw...,Michael
"You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face. [looks towards the sky] I'm okay. No, I'm not.",Michael
Phyllis there's a package for you.,Pam
"Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box]",Phyllis
[after snatching the clipboard with her signature] Got it.,Dwight
"[movie] Sam, Sam Sam. It's not that you dumped my granddaughter, and its not that you want children. It, it's that you lied to me. Can't you see that? Can't you see? Oh, I can never trust you. [Andy looks like he's going to cry]",Lily
"Lilly no. Lilly! Lilly please! Lilly STOP! I don't care how much time we have left. I don't care what my friends say! And I don't care what your mom thinks! Frankly I'm pretty sure she's not makin any sense. Please. Move back to my apartment. [Andy's crying, 'I'm All Out of Love' starts playing] Lilly. I'm not giving up. I'm not giving up. Lilly... Lilly! Push the reverse button! Reverse the button!",Sam
[through tears] Sam! Sam!,Andy
"Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then.",Pam
So what did he say? Was it my fault?,Jim
"Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.",Pam
You ok?,Jim
Yeah. [they hug],Pam
"When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous]",Pam
"I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad.",Andy
Michael! It's really good to see you.,Pam
Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?,Dwight
Are you alright?,Jim
"Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement]",Oscar
"I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.",Michael
What?,Pam
"Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela? [Angela raises her hand] Whoa there you are, I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are... [Stanley is laughing] Oscar, you're gay.",Michael
Wow.,Oscar
"Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted. [Stanley is still laughing] Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid. You guys are the reason I went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, God bless, God bless America, and get home safe. [clapping and murmurs of appreciation]",Michael
"They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should... better hold onto them pills, just in case.",Michael
"[breathing heavy over intercom, starts laughing]",Michael
"This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.",Jim
"[over PA] This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration. [snickering] I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me. [wheezing laughing, starts coughing] Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it.",Michael
[disgusted groan],Jim
Could I stick it with a pin?,Michael
Ugh.,Pam
"[still talking over PA] Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets [Jim stands up, puts scissors in back pocket] because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine.",Michael
[sighs and knocks on Michaels door],Jim
"You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert.",Michael
"That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...",Jim
What?,Michael
"What the heck? Is that, uh... [bends down, cuts phone cords with scissors]",Jim
You find it?,Michael
"I didn't, I'll look somewhere else.",Jim
All right.,Michael
All right.,Jim
Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.,Michael
"[knocks on Pam's hotel door] Hello, good morning.",Michael
Good morning.,Pam
"You ready? And we're off, like a herd of turtles.",Michael
"Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam. [laughs] No, uh, seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter. [looks at Pam] Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy.",Michael
He brought a sled.,Pam
"No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.",Michael
"Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.",Pam
"Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go! [gets in backseat] Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.",Michael
Separate rooms.,Pam
Well that goes without saying.,Michael
I'm going to say it anyway.,Pam
"Hey! Look at what you're wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magician's assistant? That's...",Michael
This is a new cardigan.,Pam
...kind of [retches] Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.,Michael
No.,Pam
"No. Oh, all right.",Michael
"[front door slams, Kelly walks by] Hey, Kelly.",Jim
Screw you.,Kelly
"Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.",Dwight
Oh yeah? Screw you too.,Kelly
Whoa! What was that all about.,Jim
"You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday.",Phyllis
[Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead.,Jim
"Go ahead, you do it.",Dwight
Okay.,Jim
I insist.,Dwight
"Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.",Jim
What he said was... [puts finger toward Jim's face],Dwight
"[pushes Dwight's finger away] Just, easy.",Jim
"...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.",Dwight
Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.,Jim
"[at the same time as Jim] I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. [shoves Jim's arm away] That's on my side.",Dwight
So this is fun.,Jim
"My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.",Kelly
Can I turn on the radio?,Pam
No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.,Michael
But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do.,Pam
"Then listen to your iPod, Pam.",Michael
That's dangerous.,Pam
Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk.,Michael
That's okay I can... I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head.,Pam
"You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so...",Michael
"No, that was a long time ago.",Pam
Is that why your wearing makeup today?,Michael
"No, I'm not even wearing that much.",Pam
"I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so...",Pam
"Oh, this is a nice office.",Julia
[laughs] You don't have to lie. Through here.,Stanley
"Um Phyllis, who's that?",Andy
She's out of your league Andy.,Phyllis
"For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women.",Andy
Sexually?,Phyllis
This conversation is over.,Andy
"I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win.",Andy
We just wanted to say we are very sorry.,Jim
Screw you guys. You're dead to me.,Kelly
If you say screw you one more time...,Dwight
"Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that.",Kelly
"Hey, HEY.",Dwight
[while Dwight and Kelly are arguing] Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?,Jim
"I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.",Kelly
Oh God.,Dwight
Okay.,Jim
"In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.",Kelly
What kind of cake do you want imbecile.,Dwight
Ice Cream.,Kelly
"[taking Michael's picture] Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.",Pam
"Hello, Rolando, how are you?",Michael
Hi.,Rolando
"Rolando, [clears throat] I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.",Michael
"[sarcastically chuckles] Uh, your late, everyone's already in the conference room. Karen will be right here to take you over.",Rolando
"Okay, don't be nervous, just picture her naked.",Michael
"Stop it, please.",Pam
"That's what I do, steal my trick.",Michael
Please cut it out.,Pam
"Hey. Hi, guys.",Karen
[notices Karen's pregnant] Oh my God. Is that Jim's?,Michael
What!,Karen
Michael!,Pam
Of course not!,Karen
"Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, you're huge! That's incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... I'm just, I'm trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had sex, and...",Michael
"Let's just get this over with, shall we?",Karen
"Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months?",Michael
[partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding?,Jim
"Well, I'm not done yet.",Dwight
"Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?",Jim
They match the carpet,Dwight
What is that? [looks at sign that says 'IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.'] It is your birthday period.,Jim
It's a statement of fact.,Dwight
Not even an exclamation point?,Jim
This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.,Dwight
I can't believe how bad this looks.,Jim
"Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.",Dwight
"Okay, good then.",Jim
Have you collected the money from everyone?,Dwight
I am working on it.,Jim
How much do you have?,Dwight
Six dollars.,Jim
[yelling] That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!,Dwight
I said I was working on it.,Jim
[sighs],Dwight
"[looking into Julia's car] Trying to see what CD's she got. It's good to know the deets about the girl you're wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes! [bangs on car and alarm goes off] Whoa! Aah, Aah! [backs up and runs into another car starting another alarm]",Andy
"[on cell phone] NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you... [hangs up phone, sighs] This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No you can't. [Karen raises her hand] Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?",Michael
"Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?",Karen
"I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died.",Michael
But now we think you're a liar.,Karen
Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars? [Pam tosses a handful of Mounds bars at everyone],Michael
"I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald. [starts singing] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it.",Michael
"I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. 'M' your name is Mark.",Michael
Yes.,Mark
Got it. It works.,Michael
"Uh, it's very insulting.",Karen
But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?,Michael
But we already know each other's names.,Mark
"Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it's worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.",Michael
"Okay. All right everyone, meeting's over.",Karen
"Oh, I still have more.",Michael
"Can I please see you in my office, please?",Karen
"She is pregnant. She is knocked up. 'K' Karen. Pam, let's go.",Michael
"I can't accept these prices, Stanley. They just cut our budget.",Julia
"Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Let's see. How many did I put in there? [starts singing to the tune of Feist's 1234] One, Two, Three, Four Splenda's in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I don't know how you take it. But if you'd rather...",Andy
Four Splenda. Are you crazy?,Stanley
"Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that's not how the songs goes.",Andy
Are you out of your damn mind?,Stanley
"Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don't even set me up with her.",Andy
We're not friends. I didn't think about it.,Stanley
"We are friends. Stanley, we're friends. And you let me down.",Andy
"You really like her, huh?",Stanley
Yeah. I really like her with all my heart.,Andy
[thinks for a moment] Give me two clients for her.,Stanley
"I grab this [grabs a chain saw], and I turn it on and I say, 'Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre.'",Michael
"No that's, that is incredibly dangerous.",Karen
"No, don't worry, the chain is off.",Michael
No it's not.,Pam
"You know, I think I'm just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team.",Karen
"Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. Don't, don't blow it.",Michael
So when are you due?,Pam
"Uh, in about a month.",Karen
"Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations.",Pam
Thank you. It just all happened so fast.,Karen
"It's really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?",Michael
"Yes, Michael. My husband impregnated me.",Karen
"Oh, great.",Michael
"His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky.",Karen
"Oh, he's cute.",Pam
"Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that?",Karen
What is happening there? [points at picture],Pam
"Oh, yeah. Don't even. That's really dorky.",Karen
It's really sweet.,Pam
"No, it's really dorky. You were right the first time.",Michael
"So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim?",Karen
"Uh, they're good. Uh, Jim's good. We're engaged.",Pam
That's so great. That's great.,Karen
Thank you.,Pam
"Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you. [hugs pam]",Karen
Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment.,Michael
"I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother.",Stanley
"So Julia, um, let's see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend's house or?",Andy
"No, it could go straight to our business address.",Julia
"Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?",Andy
"Actually, I, I don't have a boyfriend.",Julia
"[stammers] Really? Is that... wow, that's so weird.",Andy
"Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking.",Andy
"[quietly] Oh, my desk is over... [quickly walks away]",Oscar
"This gal, she's really into you?",Creed
"Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up.",Andy
"All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her.",Creed
"Okay, it sounds risky.",Andy
"Have I ever steered you wrong, Jim?",Creed
"Wait, what?",Andy
"I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean.",Michael
I like her.,Pam
"Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.",Michael
"I'm serious. Um, I'm really glad I came.",Pam
Why?,Michael
"Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good.",Pam
Thanks for walking me out.,Julia
"Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there's all kinds of weirdo's out here, so...",Andy
You must be freezing.,Julia
I am about to die. [laughs] Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?,Andy
"Oh, no, it's okay. This is my car.",Julia
"Okay, Okay. Well listen, you're a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee.",Andy
What's a 'Nard-Dog'?,Julia
[points to self] This is the Nard-Dog.,Andy
[Andy leans in to kiss her] Whoa. What the hell?,Julia
"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I'm a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You're, like, incredibly pretty.",Andy
I just got out of a relationship too. It's really hard.,Julia
"Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?",Andy
"No, I, I don't think so.",Julia
"Sure, yeah that's... your right. It's too soon for... definitely too soon for me. So I'm glad we go that out of the way. I'm gonna be in touch with you. In three months. I'm gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk.",Andy
[chuckles] Okay.,Julia
Take care Julia.,Andy
Thank you.,Julia
[as Julia is pulling out] Sorry I tried to kiss y...,Andy
We lost the account.,Andy
[struggling to blow up a balloon as his desk phone rings] Damn it! [answers phone] Dwight Schrute.,Dwight
[over the phone] How old's Kelly?,Jim
Who is this?,Dwight
It's Mose. Who do you think it is?,Jim
Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you.,Dwight
"Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?",Jim
"Uh, 24. 37.",Dwight
Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?,Jim
[sighs] I'll call you back. [goes to a filling cabinet takes out a file and looks around],Dwight
"I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share. [opens file] 'Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center.' Juvie. 'According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor...' Blah, Blah, Blah. [closes file]",Dwight
Are you asleep?,Pam
"No. I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?",Michael
"No, remind me.",Pam
"Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.",Michael
"Perfect boobs, [gives a look at the camera] of course I remember Holly.",Pam
"She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didn't... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that.",Michael
"Okay, lets go.",Pam
[scoofs] I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester.,Michael
"Yeah, screw 'em. Let's do this.",Pam
[chuckles] Okay.,Michael
[leaning against Creed's desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.,Jim
I'd like to contribute.,Creed
"Oh, great.",Jim
[opens wallet and hands Jim a single bill] There you go.,Creed
[looks at a three dollar bill],Jim
"I am on a lecture circuit. I'm goin' around to all the branches, and I'm telling them my secret recipe for success.",Michael
"I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty, Mole, Lazy Eye, Mexico, Baldy.",Michael
[holding a chainsaw] And I turn it on and I say 'Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.',Michael
How's Jim?,Karen
We're engaged.,Pam
"Oh my God, I'm so happy for you!",Karen
"Oh, wow, thank you!",Pam
You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? She's the love of my life. She just left... and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.,Michael
"... Okay, let's go.",Pam
[Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two?,Oscar
I didn't eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn't eat all my lunch.,Kevin
"[enters smiling and waving] Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.",Angela
It... yeah.,Kevin
"Angela, you're more chipper than usual.",Oscar
"I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. [takes a breath, excitedly] She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.",Angela
How much?,Meredith
Seven thousand dollars.,Angela
For a cat? I could get you a kid for that.,Creed
Where'd you get that kind of money?,Oscar
I sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay.,Angela
"Wait, you didn't give it back?",Kevin
He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!,Angela
Seven grand?,Meredith
Mm-hmm.,Angela
I gotta see that little bitch.,Meredith
I have something better than a picture. Come on.,Angela
You have your cats on Nanny-Cam?,Oscar
"Yeah. [cats meowing] I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.",Angela
She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.,Meredith
Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.,Angela
"Any cat, you mean.",Kevin
And person.,Angela
"So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! [laughs] [whispers] I've been driving too long.",Pam
[shouts from another room] What did you do?,Dwight
Stop yelling at me!,Kelly
What did you do?,Dwight
I didn't do anything!,Kelly
"What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?",Dwight
Hey! What the hell's goin' on?,Jim
Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.,Dwight
I was kickin' it.,Kelly
In juvie.,Dwight
What?,Jim
Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!,Dwight
Yep.,Jim
For reha-,Dwight
Got it.,Jim
What did you do? Huh?,Dwight
"Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.",Jim
"Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law. [to Kelly] What did you do?",Dwight
"My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!",Kelly
I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!,Dwight
"Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.",Jim
You did? I wanna see the cake.,Kelly
And... ta da.,Jim
I hate it.,Kelly
How do you hate it? It's a cake.,Jim
"Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!",Kelly
Right.,Jim
I forgot if there was an 'e' between the 'l' and the 'y.' I still don't know.,Jim
"I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?!",Kelly
Birthday.,Jim
Frosting.,Dwight
Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme. [walks out],Kelly
There's always a theme.,Phyllis
"Nice job on the cake, Bozo!",Dwight
"Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.",Jim
"[taking Michael's picture] Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.",Pam
Do I look okay?,Michael
You look good.,Pam
Hi.,Michael
"Hi, can I help you?",Receptionist
"Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch.",Michael
"Yes, we were expecting you. Have a seat.",Receptionist
"Thank you. ... Um... is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here?",Michael
"Actually, she's on an HR retreat for the next three days.",Receptionist
Oh- She's not here?,Michael
"But, if you need to get in touch with her immediately, you could talk to A.J. He's a salesman here.",Receptionist
A.J.,Michael
"Yeah, he's her boyfriend. He's just over there.",Receptionist
She has a boyfriend.,Michael
"I'm so sorry, Michael.",Pam
"How could she do this to me, Pam?",Michael
She's not doing it to hurt you.,Pam
"I can't do the presentation, I can't- [voice cracks] ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God! [starts crying, covers his face]",Michael
"Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-",Pam
"I know, just... uh, please, I'm going through something, okay? [exhales]",Michael
"You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing.",Pam
And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.,Michael
"Yeah, maybe.",Pam
[laughs],Michael
Maybe. One step at a time.,Pam
[sighs],Michael
You can do this.,Pam
I can do this.,Michael
"It could be snacks, or-",Oscar
"Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela's computer, sounds like crying]",Kevin
Wha-,Oscar
Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela's computer],Kevin
Good God!,Oscar
[gasps],Kevin
[laughs],Oscar
[gasps],Angela
That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!,Kevin
No!,Angela
Awesome!,Meredith
"Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.",Angela
"Yeah, I know fixed; that ain't fixed.",Meredith
No way.,Kevin
"No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. [all laugh] I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!",Angela
"Oh, the other one's watching.",Kevin
"Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.",Jim
Busy!,Dwight
"Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?",Jim
"Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.",Dwight
You know what? I could use a little help.,Jim
You know what? I'm a little busy.,Dwight
"We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?",Jim
It's not effeminate. It's festive.,Dwight
"You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!",Jim
"I know, I just read it on the sign.",Stanley
"Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn... about paper' and get them to 'Show us the money!' Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let's see the salesmen. [some raise their hands] Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, you're a salesman. What's, uh, what's your name?",Michael
A.J.,A.J.
A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?,Michael
[laughs],A.J.
What do you race cars?,Michael
[laughs] I'm a salesman. That's why I raised my hand.,A.J.
"Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?",Michael
"Yeah. Why, are you interested? [all laugh]",A.J.
I have a question about discounts from distributors.,Woman
"Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious?",Michael
"It's pretty serious, yes.",A.J.
Huh- [pauses] Does she ever talk about me? [voice cracking],Michael
"Oh, God.",Pam
Excuse me?,A.J.
What does this have to do with sales?,Man
It's all connected. Shut up. [to A.J.] Does she ever mention 'Michael Scott?',Michael
"No, what are you talking about?",A.J.
[sighs loudly] Does it feel good?,Michael
Does what feel good?,A.J.
"[grunts] Your life. [sits down, upset] Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let's just- We'll just continue. [sighs, falls to floor, gets more upset] Oh, wow. [takes deep breath] Ooh, okay.",Michael
"Michael, get off the floor!",Pam
"Yeah, yeah... uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards.",Michael
"[whispering] No, no, no, you have to do it-",Pam
"No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right. [sighs heavily] Okay... okay.",Michael
"That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. [pauses] I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation. [reading from the cards, in Forrest Gump voice] Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump.",Pam
"[pointing to staff members] Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! [holds up chainsaw, makes a wimpy chain saw noise] Cutting down the competition.",Pam
"[cats meowing in background][on Nanny-Cam] Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now.",Angela
[chuckles],Oscar
[snickers],Kevin
"[meows like a cat, then hisses]",Angela
This is getting weird.,Kevin
"Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows]",Oscar
Ohhh...,Kevin
"[sighs, touches Holly's sweater, cuts off sleeve, chuckles, sees Word document on Holly's computer named 'Dear Michael,' plugs in USB flash drive to copy file from computer]",Michael
[shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time?,Angela
I have no idea.,Oscar
I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.,Kevin
"[sigh of relief] Well, sorry I'm late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth]",Angela
"I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.",Oscar
[loading up car with Michael] Don't look up. Don't look up. [sighs as office workers all looking from window],Pam
Want some pie?,Michael
No.,Pam
I went through Holly's things.,Michael
What?,Pam
I stole a sleeve of her sweater.,Michael
"Oh, Michael...",Pam
I also stole something off of her computer. A document called 'Dear Michael.',Michael
You did what?,Pam
I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it.,Michael
She never sent it to you?,Pam
"No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it.",Michael
No.,Pam
Yes.,Michael
"No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust.",Pam
How?,Michael
"Because, she didn't send it to you!",Pam
"I know, I know. You're right, you're right.",Michael
I could read it.,Pam
"No, that wouldn't-",Michael
"Yeah, I could read it.",Pam
"No, you don't have to do that.",Michael
Go get your laptop.,Pam
Okay. [leaves to get laptop],Michael
[to camera] What? I'm not in love with her.,Pam
"[blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too.",Dwight
"I'm not writing, 'Horse Hunt.' I don't even know what that means.",Jim
It's in the name.,Dwight
"[grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.",Jim
"You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid.",Dwight
"Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?",Jim
"Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite]",Dwight
"Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.",Jim
"Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you?",Dwight
"Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.",Jim
"That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.",Dwight
[to camera] Didn't see that one coming.,Jim
[closes laptop] It's deleted.,Pam
Well?,Michael
She still has feelings for you.,Pam
She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?,Michael
"I can't tell you specifically, but... it's not over.",Pam
You're sure?,Michael
[nods and smiles],Pam
"[smiles, sighs, chuckles] Okay.",Michael
[enters conference room],Kelly
Happy Birthday!,All
Surprise!,Meredith
"Hey, it's not a surprise.",Dwight
Not a surprise.,Jim
This doesn't look good.,Kelly
"What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?",Jim
[shakes her head no],Kelly
Told you.,Dwight
"You haven't heard our theme, though.",Jim
"You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?",Kelly
"That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.",Jim
"Our theme, if you will.",Dwight
"Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.",Jim
That's our theme.,Dwight
Cool.,Kelly
Yeah?,Jim
I love it.,Kelly
"[high-fives Jim] Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?",Dwight
Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?,Kevin

No.,Jim
"Oh, then pick TV.",Kevin
Take a nap!,Meredith

"[turns off lights] Okay, you've got one hour. [shuts door]",Dwight
I'm too excited to sleep.,Kelly
"Mm, great cake.",Dwight
Thanks. [both eat cake],Jim
"[opens door to wake Kelly, bangs together two trash can covers loudly] Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. [slaps Kelly's butt] Many happy returns. [slams door]",Dwight
I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.,Michael
"No, we don't need to do that.",Pam
"Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!",Michael
You mean Tony?,Pam
"Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!",Michael
"Oh, Michael.",Pam
"Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.",Michael
"As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. It's been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of God's most perfect creations...a beautiful new cat! It's tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars!",Angela
[holds up cell phone showing video of Angela talking to her cats] For a rainy day. [laughs],Kevin
Hi.,Phone Salesman
"Good morning, can I help you?",Pam
"Yes, I'm from Techstar about a new phone system for you. I was wondering if I could talk to Michael Scott.",Phone Salesman
"I'm sorry, he's not in right now.",Pam
Really? He's never around when I come by.,Phone Salesman
Shoot.,Pam
"They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job. But I'd like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. [realizing] Vending machine.",Pam
"How about I make an appointment to come back? That way, I know he'll be here.",Phone Salesman
That is a great idea.,Pam
Great.,Phone Salesman
"[while leafing through Michael's appointment book and seeing nothing but free time] Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really...",Pam
"[approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager. Hi, how are ya?",Jim
There he is!,Pam
"Oh, hi! Great.",Phone Salesman
"Nice to meet you, yeah. Whew! I can assure you we don't need a new system though. Happy with ours.",Jim

"Really, Jim? On Cupid's birthday?",Pam
Yeah. [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away] She's fine.,Jim
"So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer. [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.",Kelly
"Oh, wow look at those. How nice for you. Up there, front and center, beautiful. I think they would look better right here. [Michael takes the flowers from Pam's desk and puts them on the ground off to the side] They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall. [Kevin groans]",Michael
"Just about everyone in this office is single right now. Including me. And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain. Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine's Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.",Michael
"Pam, really, they're back?",Michael
I can't see them when they're on the floor,Pam
"They're for her to look at, Michael.",Jim
"Can I have a word with you, Jim?",Michael
"Yes, let's have a word.",Jim
"Yes, um, Jim. Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.",Michael
"Oh, I'm sorry.",Jim
"Yeah. And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment.",Michael
I understand that.,Jim
So sexy it becomes hostile.,Dwight
Mm-hmm.,Michael
"Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.",Jim
"Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--",Michael
We do.,Jim
--that none of us can be a part of--,Michael
"You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael.",Pam
"[gesturing Pam to be quiet] --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party.",Michael
That sounds fun.,Jim
"So suck it. Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only.",Michael
"Yeah, deal with it Pam!",Dwight
"So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.",Michael
Having trouble finding a vein?,Dwight
"Yup, a little.",Blood Drive Worker
How about now? [Dwight untenses his arm],Dwight
"I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command. Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]",Dwight
"I am about to give blood. The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that's a big needle, that --",Michael
You're gonna need to lie down right over here.,Blood Drive Worker
Okay. Hello.,Michael
"Hi, I cant talk right now. I'm sorry.",Blood Girl
"Oh, OK.",Michael
"Whew, I'm really nervous.",Blood Girl
"Yeah, me too.",Michael
"Yeah, when I get nervous I sort of clam up.",Blood Girl
"Oh, well, that's fine.",Michael
"Whew, it's better for me just to be quiet, yeah.",Blood Girl
"Yeah, can I point something out to you?",Michael
Sure.,Blood Girl
You're actually talking a lot.,Michael
"Sorry, it's the other thing I do when I get really nervous.",Blood Girl
"Okay, here we go.",Michael
"Alright, here we go.",Blood Drive Worker
"Oh, God. [Michael clears his throat]",Michael
Just relax.,Blood Drive Worker
"Yup, I'm good, whew. Wow, I feel like a human juicebox. [Blood Girl laughs] Hawaiian blood punch.",Michael
"Oh, that's gross.",Blood Girl
Type O-Ocean Spray.,Michael
"God, stop. Stop it.",Blood Girl
"Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me? We'll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob.",Phyllis
What do you think?,Pam
I have a lot of work to do this afternoon. Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.,Jim
We're in.,Pam
Yick.,Michael
What?,Blood Girl
I looked at the bag.,Michael
Ew.,Blood Girl
I looked straight at the bag.,Michael
That's not good.,Blood Girl
"Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them?",Michael
"Well, ok... bags! [Michael is taken aback] Alright, that was bad.",Blood Girl
That was mean.,Michael
"Um, a hat.",Blood Girl
A hat.,Michael
A hat with no blood in it?,Blood Girl
That is full of soup.,Michael
You're cute.,Blood Girl
What?,Michael
You're done.,Blood Drive Worker
"Oh, already.",Michael
"Ah, we did it!",Blood Girl
"Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days. [Michael passes out]",Michael
Is he OK?,Blood Girl
"[ccming to] Oh my God, how long was I out? [Michael looks over where Blood Girl was and sees Hank]",Michael
What?,Hank
"Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?",Michael
Oh. She left.,Blood Drive Worker
"OK. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers. This is hers, she left her glove. I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove.",Michael
I'm sorry sir we can't give out that information. [Michael sighs],Blood Drive Worker
[seeing Kelly tear a paper heart in half] What are you doing?,Meredith
Decorating.,Kelly
I'll help. [Meredith tears the wings off of a Cupid] Now it's just a stupid baby.,Meredith
"Yeah, thanks.",Kelly
It is so nice to go out with another couple.,Phyllis
Anything to get out of that office.,Pam
I know,Phyllis
"I honestly don't know how you can work with that jackass, that other jackass, and that new jackass.",Bob
"He's talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy.",Phyllis
"Oh yeah, I understood.",Jim
"Well here we all are. Alone but together. No flowers for us. [in a Mexican accent] Relationships, we don't need no stinking relationships. I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan? He treated you pretty terribly, yeah?",Michael
"Well, his heart was in the right place.",Kelly
"Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex. [Kelly looks hurt] Okay, sorry, let's, who else? Oscar.",Michael
I don't think so.,Oscar
"Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest.",Michael
I can't.,Oscar
"If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure? I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault. OK well, who else?",Michael
Everyone here who's bowled a 280 please raise your hand. [Bob does so],Bob
"No way, a 280?",Jim
"Wow, that's impressive.",Pam
Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand.,Phyllis
Yikes.,Jim
"Come on, Bob. Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly]",Phyllis
"No. Bob, no. No!",Jim
What?,Pam
"One time. You love bringing up that one time, don't you?",Bob
Yes I do.,Phyllis
Jim uses a 6 pound ball.,Pam
"That is a lie, that is a lie.",Jim
"Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.",Pam
But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.,Jim
"No, you just have little dainty fingers.",Pam
Oh yeah. You can always model ladies' jewelry.,Bob
"Nobody asked, Bob!",Jim
Do you risk telling him how you feel? Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?,Oscar
"Oh God, what did you do? I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...",Angela
"I was stupid, I told him.",Oscar
Was he in to you in like a gay way?,Kevin
"Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story.",Michael
He told me he wasn't gay. [everyone groans],Oscar
Really sad.,Michael
I'm not done yet.,Oscar
Oh my God.,Michael
"A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says 'I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.' [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised]",Kevin
"Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!",Michael
My worst breakup was actually two breakups. Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.,Angela
"Yeah, Dwight and Andy. We were here.",Oscar
"No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio. John Mark and John David.",Angela
"Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?",Oscar
I guess I have. Huh.,Angela
Alright who's next? Where's Andy?,Michael
He's on one of his honeymoons.,Oscar
What?,Michael
"He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time. I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.",Oscar
"My worst breakup was with Stacy. It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said 'Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!' and she said that we're done.",Kevin
You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.,Michael
"You're right. OK everyone, back to work.",Dwight
"No, no, no, no. I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too. We just need to find them. There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park. There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.",Michael
A net? a giant net?,Dwight
No. Not a giant net.,Michael
What do you have in mind?,Dwight
I was thinking maybe like a mixer.,Michael
"Oh God, that's a terrible idea.",Dwight
Old fashioned meet market --,Michael
No.,Dwight
-- I don't think it is.,Michael
"Lonely people mixing with one another? Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation? Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work. Pssh. You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.",Dwight
"These people need love and I am going to get it for them Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today? A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else. I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say 'I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow.' Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.",Michael
Hey.,Michael
Hey. No movement.,Dwight
"Ah, still early.",Michael
"Eh, its not that early.",Dwight
[sighs] So how you holding up?,Michael
I'm ok. Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.,Dwight
"No. No, I meant about being single today.",Michael
Oh. Meh.,Dwight
"Meh, exactly. Eh.",Michael
Eh.,Dwight
"Oh, here we go.",Michael
Hello.,Dwight
"Hello. [two women, a blonde and a redhead, enter the office. Michael and Dwight walk towards them and Dwight extends his hand to the redhead]",Michael
"Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde] Hi, Dwight.",Dwight
"Babe alert! [to the redhead] Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.",Michael
"Oh, hi! I'm Lynn.",Lynn
"Lynn, follow me, come on in. For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone. Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.",Michael
Hello.,Kevin
Hi.,Lynn
"[after a short pause] So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev. [after another pause] Where you from?",Michael
I'm from here!,Kevin
"Yeah, OK. Well, he only gets better.",Michael
"Thank you, Michael.",Kevin
"I can untie any knot. I'm serious. Name a knot, any knot. Go ahead.",Dwight
I- I- believe you.,Blonde
"You shouldn't believe everything you hear. In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie. So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.",Dwight
"Um, I work at a place that does catalogs for community colleges and small businesses.",Blonde
You must use a lot of paper.,Dwight
Oh God tons of it .,Blonde
What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?,Pam
I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.,Jim
"Oh, damn. [Pam looks down at her salad] They've been in there for like ten minutes.",Pam
Look at that. Bob ordered hot food.,Jim
Yes. And I think they gave him too many fries.,Pam
"We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]",Jim
At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies. It's really cool.,Kevin
That does sound cool.,Lynn
"I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity]. No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused]. She left me. [Kevin walks away dejected]",Kevin
I think I blew it. It all happened so fast. So... fast.,Kevin
"So, Eric. You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.",Michael
I am.,Eric
"Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair. Alright, I'll let you guys talk.",Michael
"It's going very well. People are mixing, a lot of hope. Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. [Michael suddenly turns to look at the open entrance door] Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in. Um, so [looking at his watch] it's not too late.",Michael
"...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?",Dwight
No reason.,Michael
Is somebody after you?,Dwight
Why do you always go to that? Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?,Oscar
"Hey, it just takes one!",Dwight
"Nobody's after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.",Michael
You met a woman when you were giving blood? That is so romantic.,Kelly
"It's not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.",Michael
"Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic. This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale.",Kelly
She could be your soul mate.,Meredith
"Oh, not likely. 3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.",Dwight
It's possible.,Oscar
She could be.,Kelly
"Believe me its nothing. I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.",Michael
Aww. [Michael grins sheepishly],Kelly
Here they come.,Jim
[looking up from her pilfering of Bob's food] What?,Pam
"No, just kidding. Seriously though, that's enough.",Jim
"Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.",Pam
"Oh great, I have to cover?",Jim
Do you think they dined and dashed?,Pam
"Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.",Jim
I thought we were having a nice time.,Pam
We were.,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
[emerging from the Men's room] Empty.,Jim
[exiting the Ladies' room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it. Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate],Pam
Oh boy.,Jim
My God.,Pam
OK.,Jim
Is this the party? [everyone turns to Michael wanting to know if this is Blood Girl],Girl
Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.,Michael
OK then.,Bob
So...,Jim
Where were we?,Bob
[out of breath] Bowling.,Phyllis
"Yep, that, yeah.",Pam
You didn't eat much there Jimbo.,Bob
Oh initially I did.,Jim
Want some meat?,Bob
"Oh sure, a little piece. Ooh, no mushroom though.",Phyllis
Forgot.,Bob
"Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]",Phyllis
"Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more. I get very nervous talking to pretty girls. Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.",Kevin
That's really sweaty.,Lynn
Are you on email?,Kevin
"Oh, yeah. [gives Kevin her card]",Lynn
Cool. Bye.,Kevin
"Bye, Kevin.",Lynn
Good Valentine's.,Kevin
"So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.",Dwight
OK. [Blonde stands up to leave],Blonde
"OK, what's up?",Dwight
"Look, I'm gonna go...",Blonde
"Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this. You know maybe sign--",Dwight
"Look, we already have a paper supplier.",Blonde
"OK. Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot. God!",Dwight
"Hey, you don't deserve her.",Michael
"Thanks, Michael.",Dwight
"Hey, if anybody wants to go...",Michael
We can stay a little longer.,Oscar
"Really? [everybody signifies their agreement, and Kelly gives Michael a piece of cake] Oh, thanks.",Michael
"Michael, it's time.",Kelly
"You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit.",Michael
"Come on, we'll all go.",Oscar
[after some encouragement] OK.,Michael
"Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I've even considered getting back into that arena again. You know what, sometimes it's not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all. There's a lot of princesses out there. You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.",Michael
"Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie? I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy.",Stanley
Of course. [noticing Stanley's arm] That's weird. You got a cotton ball and tape and we've been using Band-Aids.,Blood Drive Worker
"[backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids.",Stanley
Damn.,Phyllis
"[on the phone] Yeah, that's no problem.",Pam
Pam?,Michael
[on the phone] Sure. Uh huh.,Pam
"Pam? Knock, knock.",Michael
I'm on the phone.,Pam
"I know you are. Knock, knock.",Michael
"[on the phone] You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--",Pam
[at same time as Pam] 4-9-1-7-4-5-1,Michael
"0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. [to Michael] It really makes us look unprofessional.",Pam
"They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock. [Dwight walks over]",Michael
[sighs] Who's there?,Pam
Buddha.,Michael
Buddha who?,Pam
"[puts a slice of bread and stick of butter on Pam's desk] Buddha this bread for me, won't you? [Michael and Dwight laugh]",Michael
Great.,Pam
"I, I need something to wipe my hand.",Michael
"Now there's, there's butter on my desk.",Pam
That was helping. It was classic.,Michael
I got a knock-knock joke.,Dwight
No... God.,Michael
"OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.",Dwight
Alright.,Michael
"[clears throat] Knock, knock.",Dwight
Who's there?,Michael
KGB.,Dwight
KGB - [Dwight slaps Michael on the face],Michael
[in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!,Dwight
What the hell was that? [Michael starts to fight with Dwight],Michael
What are you doing?,Dwight
What are you doing?,Michael
Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!,Dwight
"You, you like that?",Michael
C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.,Dwight
Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it.,Michael
Ding Dong.,Jim
[to Jim] Who's there?,Michael
KGB.,Jim
"Dwight, get the door.",Michael
I'm not answering it.,Dwight
Answer the door.,Michael
Ding dong.,Jim
"No way, it's the KGB.",Dwight
Ding dong.,Jim
I'm not answering that. You answer it.,Dwight
I'm not gonna answer it,Michael
"I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight]",Dwight
The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs],Jim
It's true.,Dwight
"[Michael walks in dressed as Willy Wonka] Good morning, Michael.",Pam
"Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.",Michael
"Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.",Pam
"Why thank you very much. [notices jelly beans] Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!",Michael
Jelly beans.,Pam
"No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!",Michael
"The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.",Michael
"I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. [Jim raises hand] Umm hmm.",Michael
We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --,Jim
Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.',Michael
Free paper.',Jim
No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.,Michael
"Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...",Andy
"No, you don't. No, it - [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?",Michael
I think I should call her.,Kevin
No! No! No!,Andy
Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?,Kevin
"[sighs] You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'",Andy
But I do like her just the way she is.,Kevin
Well that's not what we agreed on.,Andy
What are you doing?,Jim
Huh?,Andy
"[to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.",Jim
No.,Andy
"You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.",Pam
You're asking him to give up all of his power.,Andy
What power?,Jim
"Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker.",Kevin
"You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.'",Andy
That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that?,Pam
Well guys with girlfriends don't.,Jim
"That's low, Tuna.",Andy
"[on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]",Jim
Woo hoo.,Michael
[on phone] I'll take that down right now.,Jim
Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...,Michael
I'm on the phone.,Jim
...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?,Michael
[on phone] Hold on one second.,Jim
Invite them on the tour.,Michael
[to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.,Jim
"Really? That's kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?",Michael
Ten percent?,Oscar
Yeah?,Michael
They're our largest client.,Oscar
Yeah.,Michael
It's gonna hurt.,Oscar
"[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.",Jim
How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?,Jim
I thought I did. So...,Michael
OK...,Jim
Well no harm no foul.,Michael
...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.,Jim
"You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.",Michael
Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.,Michael
Start over.,Darryl
Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?,Michael
Were the boxes near each other?,Darryl
Irrelevant.,Michael
I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.,Darryl
"OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?",Michael
My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. [sighs] That... [sighs],Michael
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.",Pam
"When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one.",Pam
"Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right?",Michael
They can.,Oscar
"No, they can't.",Michael
"Yes, they can.",Oscar
"Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.",Michael
"Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?",Oscar
"Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -",Michael
"So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.",Jim
"Thank you, Jim is with me.",Michael
"Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.",Jim
Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.,Michael
That's not why.,Creed
"OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. [Pam raises hand] Yes.",Michael
Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings],Pam
Good one.,Jim
"OK, don't get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]",Michael
I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?,Stanley
That is not constructive.,Michael
"[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet.",Pam
"[on phone] Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--",Michael
"[on speaker phone] Michael, what the hell is going on here?",David
How are you doing?,Michael
Fine. What is going on?,David
[reading from computer] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.,Michael
"Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?",David
"Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know.",Michael
How could you not know Michael?,David
I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.,Michael
"Might have hi--- OK, what firm?",David
You're breaking up.,Michael
Michael?,David
"OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.",Michael
Was it the sales department?,David
Yes.,Michael
Was it Jim?,David
No.,Michael
"OK, was it Dwight?",David
[long pause] Yes.,Michael
"[Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.",Michael
That was your idea.,Dwight
"Woah, wow, who told you that?",Michael
You did. Several times. Over and over again.,Dwight
"[same time as Dwight] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.",Michael
[same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...,Dwight
I'm not taking... I'm not taking...,Michael
Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.,Dwight
"Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.",Michael
You don't keep a diary.,Dwight
Yes I do. You've just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.,Michael
Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.,Dwight
Why do you have a diary?,Michael
To keep secrets from my computer.,Dwight
"OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.",Michael
Impossible.,Dwight
"Yes, you did.",Michael
"I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.",Dwight
What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary],Michael
Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.,Dwight
Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?,Michael
With all my heart.,Dwight
You guys are throwing a lot at me.,Kevin
"All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.",Jim
Right.,Kevin
I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.,Pam
"No, that is what I mean.",Jim
"[to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic.",Pam
[puts hand on Jim's hand] Like that?,Kevin
"No, stop it.",Jim
Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.,Andy
"[Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.",Andy
We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--,Michael
"OK, what am I thinking right now?",Dwight
"Umm, nacho chips.",Michael
No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.,Dwight
"Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.",Michael
"Oh, not gonna happen.",Dwight
I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.,Dwight
"Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.",Michael
What about Shoe La La?,Dwight
[sighs] It's not ready yet.,Michael
"I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.",Michael
"May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.",Michael
These aren't announcements.,Oscar
"Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.",Michael
I love working here and I do not want to leave.,Dwight
He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.,Michael
Well...,Dwight
"I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...",Michael
We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.,Dwight
Right.,Michael
No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.,Dwight
That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.,Michael
Try me.,Dwight
That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...,Michael
I haven't made a decision yet.,Dwight
You kind of have.,Michael
No.,Dwight
Yes.,Michael
You cannot take the fall for him.,Jim
He said he would do the same for me.,Dwight
He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?,Jim
I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.,Dwight
There it is.,Jim
"[seeing David Wallace come into the office] Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do? [Dwight runs into Michael's office] What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? [David knocks on Michael's door and opens door] Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.",Michael
That's too bad.,David
"Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?",Michael
"Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight. [holds out hand for handshake]",David
David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations],Dwight
I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute? [everyone starts clapping],David
Alright Dwight. This is huge.,David
That's what she said! [David laughs],Dwight
"Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?",Michael
Inspiration.,Dwight
Really? How did-- how are you inspired? How did it pop into your head Dwight?,Michael
[same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.,Dwight
Give me the details of how that happened.,Michael
"You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.",Jim
What?,Michael
And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.,Jim
Apology rejected.,Dwight
"[going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.",Pam
Oh Pam.,Dwight
"Good work, kid.",Creed
Thanks old man.,Dwight
"This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.",David
Yeah.,Dwight
"Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?",David
Sure.,Pam
David? David?,Michael
[same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea...,Dwight
David?,Michael
Yeah?,David
Could I be a part of the meeting also?,Michael
"You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting.",David
"Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs]",Jim
Alright.,Dwight
"[on speakerphone] Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away.",David
"OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.",Dwight
"Wait, do you guys hear that? There's not a dog listening in, is there? [cut to show Michael on the other line] I hear panting.",Man on phone
No. No dogs.,David
So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].,Dwight
There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.,Michael
It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.,Pam
Pam...,Dwight
I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.,Michael
That is my idea.,Dwight
[on phone] We are gonna call you back guys. [to Michael] What is going on here?,David
"OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?",Michael
"No, no.",David
It is my idea.,Dwight
Oh how dare you.,Michael
It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.,Dwight
"You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?",Michael
Horse Boat.,Dwight
Oh please.,Michael
A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!,Dwight
Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...,Michael
Oh give me a break.,Dwight
"...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.",Michael
That's because they're easy!,Dwight
They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.,Michael
[same time as Michael] Women's urinals... uh...,Dwight
"[same time as Michael and Dwight] Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true?",David
"Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.",Dwight
Thank You!,Michael
"What, I don't -- what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now?",David
"Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.",Michael
"OK, uhh... I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes.",David
OK.,Pam
I am gone.,David
When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.,Michael
Oh I am. In my own words.,Dwight
I want to see it.,Michael
No.,Dwight
I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight's diary],Michael
"No, Michael.",Dwight
Give me... Give me the diary.,Michael
No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand],Dwight
Hi.,Lynn
"Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.",Kevin
OK.,Lynn
I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.,Kevin
OK.,Lynn
Nice. [Both laugh] Boobs. [Lynn blushes],Kevin
"Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh!",Andy
Ding dong.,Dwight
Who is it?,Jim
KGB.,Dwight
"Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.",Jim
"[in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?",Dwight
"Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.",Jim
We have more houses to visit.,Dwight
"If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.",Jim
We will come back at... how is [looks at watch] 4:45?,Dwight
I get back from work around 6.,Jim
How about 5:15?,Dwight
"You can try. That, that might work.",Jim
"Very well, we will come back at 5:15.",Dwight
Alright.,Jim
"Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.",Dwight
I like it.,Michael
Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.,Dwight
[wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough?,Jim
"Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?",Dwight
"I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.",Jim
"I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.",Michael
"And of course, classy.",Jim
"And classy, yeah.",Michael
"Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?",Dwight
"Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.",Jim
"Oh, here's one: a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. [Jim grimaces]",Dwight
"[watches Jim grimace, copies him] You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.",Michael
That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.,Jim
Yes.,Michael
Mr. Peanut is not classy.,Dwight
He is.,Michael
"He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.",Dwight
That's what makes him classy.,Michael
"Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.",Dwight
"Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.",Jim
"Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.",Dwight
"Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head: an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.",Jim
Strawberries?,Michael
That's inspired.,Jim
"I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him]",Dwight
Not classy.,Pam
Not classy at all.,Michael
De class???.,Jim
French. Classy.,Michael
"Hi, can I help you?",Pam
"Yeah, I'm Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott.",Charles
Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.,Pam
[on speakerphone] Yes?,Michael
"Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you.",Pam
Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?,Michael
"Yeah, are you coming out now?",Pam
"Uh-huh. [comes out of office] Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner. [shakes Charles' hand] At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up. [leads round of applause] Here he is.",Michael
I-I was-,Charles
"Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us . [whispers] Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.",Michael
Hey.,Jim
Yes.,Michael
Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.,Jim
"What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous.",Michael
"Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-",Jim
"You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.",Michael
"Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.",Dwight
"Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go! [swings arm above head for everyone to come, hits doorframe] Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!",Michael
"We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...",Dwight
"Surprise! [unveils bagels sitting on table] As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles.",Michael
Thank you.,Charles
Took me all night.,Michael
This is what you did last night?,Pam
"I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do. [in British cockney accent] It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental.",Michael
"My god, he's like a black George Clooney.",Kelly
"Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . .",Angela
"Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.",Jim
Why are you wearing a tuxedo?,Charles
"I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.",Jim
Uh.,Charles
"Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.",Jim
Your name is Jim?,Charles
"Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam]",Jim
He just had to wear his tux today.,Pam
I thought it'd be funny.,Jim
Took him 40 minutes to get ready.,Pam
"All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department.",Michael
"Hey, I come from accounting, too.",Charles
"Oh, nerd alert!",Michael
Ni-,Kevin
"This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that.",Michael
"Hey, Oscar, it's good to meet you.",Charles
"This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange [points to Andy]",Michael
Hey-o!,Andy
There you go! Where's the other?,Michael
"You know, Michael, I don't need to know everyone's sexual history.",Charles
"Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history.",Michael
Hey!,Kevin
How about I just say hi to everyone at one time?,Charles
"Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner. [claps]",Michael
"Thank you, Michael. Thank you for the C-shaped bagels.",Charles
Oh! Well...,Michael
That's great.,Charles
Above and beyond.,Michael
"Hey, you know we're in tough times and we're not immune to this economy.",Charles
That's true.,Michael
"But the goal is to, you know, fight our way through this.",Charles
"[clears throat, raises his hand] Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?",Stanley
No. Absolutely not.,Michael
"Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we can't make any promises, but we'll try everything in our power to avoid that.",Charles
Do you have specifics?,Oscar
"Sp-Well, um, Michael should have filled you in last week.",Charles
"Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people.",Michael
You didn't tell them.,Charles
"Well, why don't-",Michael
"Yeah, I will. What I told Michael last week-",Charles
Charles is going to tell you.,Michael
"Is that we are cutting three percent across the board, which means we will no longer be matching 401k contributions. All overtime requests will need to come through the corporate office.",Charles
Fantastic.,Stanley
"Well, it's not official.",Michael
"It is official. It is official. And actually, guys, I'm encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending.",Charles
"Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance.",Michael
"No, no, not salaries. Petty cash, supplies, and uh, you know, parties.",Charles
Well-,Michael
What about your party?,Dwight
"Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen. [starts round of applause] He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work.",Michael
"Michael, I'm going to stay for the day.",Charles
"Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet.",Michael
"No, it's a little bit more than that. I'm going to set up in here, ok?",Charles
I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled.,Michael
"[on speakerphone] David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed.",Michael
What gave you that idea?,David
It was my understanding.,Michael
I see.,David
"Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.",Michael
"Look, Michael, Charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are going to make a great team.",David
But the branch is still mine?,Michael
"You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know.",David
Ask him about the party.,Dwight
"Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?",Michael
"I'll give it my best shot, Michael.",David
No the other thing.,Dwight
"Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? [several seconds of silence]",Michael
He hung up?,Dwight
No.,David
"I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before.",Michael
No.,Charles
Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here?,Michael
Saticoy Steel.,Charles
"Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names.",Michael
"No, I worked at a company called Saticoy Steel.",Charles
You're not from paper?,Michael
No.,Charles
Does David know this?,Michael
"Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager.",Charles
"Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-",Michael
And what is that?,Charles
"And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?",Michael
That's not how I plan on doing things.,Charles
"Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back.",Michael
I'll tell David what he needs to know. Sorry. David wants it this way.,Charles
Whatever David wants.,Michael
Ok.,Charles
"[on phone] Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.",Michael
"Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em. [calls back on speakerphone]",Dwight
David Wallace's office.,Stephanie
"Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today?",Dwight
Good. Thank you.,Stephanie
How's it hanging?,Dwight
Alright. . .,Stephanie
"Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-",Dwight
"No! You idiot! [hangs up] Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god. [redials]",Michael
David Wallace's office.,Stephanie
"Hi Stephanie, it's Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine.",Michael
Michael...,Stephanie
And I really really need to talk to David.,Michael
Please hold.,Stephanie
"[on cell phone] Charles Miner. Hello? Hello, who is this? Who is this?",Charles
"I was never given a name. [hangs up, he and Dwight sigh in relief]",Michael
"[to delivery men] Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here-",Pam
"Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today.",Charles
That is so unnecessary!,Angela
Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?,Michael
It's no big deal.,Charles
"I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.",Michael
You still have that option. [Michael sighs],Charles
"Thanks again, Charles.",Angela
Thank you.,Kelly
Nobody thanked me.,Michael
"Thanks, Charles.",Jim
"For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical.",Michael
"I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning.",Charles
"[on phone] Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!",Michael
Should I seduce him?,Kelly
No. No one wants to see that. [both smile at David],Angela
Michael?,Kevin
Yep.,Michael
I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.,Kevin
"Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.",Michael
"Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? We're going to need you to do that during office hours.",Charles
Ok.,Kevin
Ok.,Charles
"Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved.",Michael
That's not the way it's gonna work.,Charles
Yes it is!,Michael
"No, it is not.",Charles
"No, it is not.",Michael
"Ok, so we're on the same page, great.",Charles
"Ok, so we're on the same page, great.",Michael
"Ok, Michael, what are you doing?",Charles
"Ok, Michael, what are you doing?",Michael
"No, seriously.",Charles
"No, seriously.",Michael
How old are you?,Charles
How old are you?,Michael
Oh no.,Pam
"I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad.",Pam
Five years old?,Charles
Five years old?,Michael
"Duuudes, stop.",Andy
"[as Michael continues imitating Charles] Not a good idea, Michael. Michael, stop. Stop doing that. Stop it. You're going to get all of us in trouble.",Employees
I will walk away.,Charles
I'm gonna walk away.,Michael
Stop doing that!,Andy
"I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room.",Michael
"And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.",Pam
What is that smaller stripper holding?,Michael
Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.,Pam
Ok.,Michael
What exactly is the PPC?,Charles
"Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.",Phyllis
"Excuse me, guys. What's going on in here?",Charles
"Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles.",Michael
This doesn't seem like a good way to spend company time.,Charles
Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead.,Michael
"No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.",Jim
"Whatcha got, Jim?... What is a two-way petting zoo?",Charles
You pet the animals and they pet you back.,Jim
It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.,Michael
It's really just a regular shaped cake.,Pam
"But it's cool, and it's-",Michael
"This isn't a good use of company time, Michael.",Charles
"Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .",Michael
"Everyone, except for Michael, go back to your desks.",Charles
"Yeah, why don't you do that?",Michael
"[Dwight, Jim and Pam leave] Thank you very much.",Charles
"Yeah, here we go. Ok.",Michael
"Ok, Michael, I'm dissolving this committee.",Charles
What?,Michael
"Yeah, I mean, come on. This is a work place. It isn't designed for your vanity.",Charles
Newsflash: I've been here for fifteen years. Headline: You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!,Michael
"I don't know if I have hurt your feelings or you do not disagree with my methods, but it is over.",Charles
"Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace. [gets jacket] I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it. [pushes chair as he leaves]",Michael
[Jim knocks on door] Come in.,Charles
Hey.,Jim
Hey.,Charles
"Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker. And a great number two for the office.",Jim
Number two?,Charles
Second-in-command to Michael.,Jim
"Oh, I didn't know that position existed.",Charles
"Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.",Jim
So you're the assistant to the regional manager?,Charles
"Assistant regional manager, yeah.",Jim
Any responsibilities come with it?,Charles
"No, not exactly.",Jim
So you keep this made up position? It's important to you?,Charles
"Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.",Jim
"Yeah, would you, uh?",Charles
Yep. [shuts door behind him],Jim
"Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he? [looks into empty office]",Michael
[coming out from bathroom] Michael.,David
[points to bathroom door] So is this the meeting you've been in all day?,Michael
"How did you get here, Michael?",David
I drove.,Michael
Ok.,David
"Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned.",Michael
Michael. Listen-,David
"Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?",Michael
"Well, I didn't know about the figs, specifically. . .",David
"Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.",Michael
That's not exactly-,David
Clearly that's what you wanted.,Michael
No.,David
Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.,Michael
Yes.,David
I've put having a family on hold.,Michael
We didn't ask you to do that.,David
And I've never gone hang-gliding. And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.,Michael
Ok. Nice meeting everyone. I'll see you in a couple of weeks.,Charles
Cool.,Andy
Excellent.,Dwight
"It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner.",Angela
See ya. See ya. [Charles leaves] Bye!,Jim
"And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.",Jim
"I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys.",Kelly
It's just me here.,Phyllis
I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight.,Kelly
I think he left.,Phyllis
What?! Move! [pushes cameraman out of the way],Kelly
"[Kelly runs to parking lot in the rain] Hello, Charles? Charles!",Angela
Hey! Is that his scarf?,Kelly
No! [Kelly chases Angela through parking lot],Angela
"[out of breath and wet] Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?",Angela
"I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you. That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that.",Michael
"Yeah. You're right. Yes. I get it. I get it, Michael. Here's what I'm going to do-",David
Ok.,Michael
"We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great. How's that?",David
[gets up to shake David's hand] I quit.,Michael
What?,David
You have no idea how high I can fly.,Michael
"I'm telling you, when corporate sends somebody, it is big trouble, or, really good news. And then sometimes it means business as usual.",Andy
"Ok, what do you think?",Meredith
"Well, it's-",Oscar
Why are you asking him? I just told you why he's here.,Andy
The real question here is who's this guy work for?,Creed
Dunder Mifflin.,Oscar
"Ah, it's all starting to make sense now.",Creed
"I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit. I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go. Feeling good. Listen to some tunes. Should've peed before I left.",Michael
Michael get to the good part.,Kelly
"Okay, so. I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken! So I have to take the normal door.",Michael
At least he is in the building.,Oscar
"No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!",Michael
[groans],Everyone
He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.,Pam
"Okay focus. Focus. You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?",Pam
I looked at Wallace and I said 'I quit!' and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said 'You have no idea how high I can fly.',Michael
Did you tell him how sick of him you were?,Stanley
Why would I do that?,Michael
"Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?",Angela
That he's wasted 15 years of your life?,Kevin
Did you spit in his face?,Meredith
You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.,Michael
I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life. Gives me hope. Maybe I will have one of own someday. [laughs] But I dream... so...,Oscar
"[Michael has a 'sticky-hand' toy and snags a paper off Jim's desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.",Jim
Michael is that scotch?,Kevin
"Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch. [in Oscar's ear] Clinky, clinky-clink. Come-on... come on, come on.",Michael
"[slightly drunk] What am I gonna do? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that. I gonna stay up all day. Gonna sleep it up all night. I'm gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO! And I'm going to stop worrying about calories.",Michael
"Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?",Stanley
I have a job.,Michael
For four more days.,Andy
Do you have any leads on a job?,Pam
"Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job. You are head-hunted.",Michael
You called any headhunters?,Jim
Any good headhunter knows I am available.,Michael
"Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,",Dwight
"Right, cause that's what we are talking about.",Jim
"Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data.",Charles
You're 'I need you to' is my command.,Michael
Okay.,Charles
Hey Michael...,Andy
Hey.,Michael
Can I talk to you a minute?,Andy
You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world. [eats some spaghetti] Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!,Michael
I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What? [takes a present out from behind his back] What's that?,Andy
Oh! Hey. What is this about?,Michael
"Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it's a farewell...",Andy
Oh.,Michael
I hope I get to work with you someday again.,Andy
"Me too, me too. Is this wine?",Michael
Ah... busted. Yes,Andy
I already have wine.,Michael
Oh.,Andy
[interviewee enters office] Hello.,Isaac
Hi.,Pam
Isaac Silby here for the interview,Isaac
"Uh, yes. Please have a seat. It'll be a few minutes.",Pam
Thank you. [to Michael] You interviewing too?,Isaac
Hmm?,Michael
Interviewing?,Isaac
For?,Michael
Regional manager.,Isaac
Yes I am.,Michael
For regional manager I've decided to go with an outside hire. For obvious reasons.,Charles
Where you from?,Michael
Philly.,Isaac
That's a drive!,Michael
"Yeah, well this is one of the few places that's hiring. It's uh, its brutal out there.",Isaac
[sighs],Michael
Pam?,Kevin
Hmm?,Pam
When will the new copier be ready?,Kevin
I'm working on it Kev.,Pam
You said it would be ready by today. And it is today.,Kevin
It'll be ready soon.,Pam
Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.,Kevin
Is that what 'soon' means to you?,Pam
Sometimes.,Kevin
Then come back soon.,Pam
"During the course of business, a copier goes though something called 'Normal wear and tear.'",Pam
[feeding coins into a vent] I think it's 75 cents.,Creed
That's a lot.,Oscar
"[Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no!",Angela
[dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!,Kevin
"Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. [holds up a huge manual]",Pam
[overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com. Singular.,Jim
Thank you. [groaning ceases],Michael
"You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players. [dials phone]",Michael
"Hi, you've reached Prince Paper. We are sad to inform you that after 40 years of serving the community we are no longer in business. Thank you for your support. May God bless you. [girl's voice] Bye!",Phone
[sighs] What am I gong to do? Uh... [chuckles].,Michael
PSST! PSST!,Michael
Yeah... .you want me to come in your office? Oh.,Jim
"Okay, oh okay, okay. Close your eyes.",Michael
I would prefer not to.,Jim
Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company.,Michael
You're starting your own paper company?,Jim
yeah!,Michael
Why?,Jim
Can you believe... cause I know paper. I know everything there is to know about paper.,Michael
Do you know the industry is in decline?,Jim
Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.,Michael
Right.,Jim
"Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes.",Michael
"No, I did that before, it added nothing.",Jim
Close them.,Michael
Okay. [keeps eyes open],Jim
"Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?",Michael
I am not gonna do this.,Jim
Obviously.,Michael
"And you are not going to, either.",Jim
"Oh, agreed, mmm, except...",Michael
"Here's the thing. What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary. Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.",Jim
Hey hey... what's up Chuck?,Michael
Jim.,Charles
Hey.,Jim
what are you doing?,Charles
"Nothing, just talking.",Jim
"Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week?",Charles
I didn't... no.,Jim
Okay. After you.,Charles
No I'm staying.,Michael
Okay.,Charles
[examining the copier manual] Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?,Dwight
"No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions.",Pam
Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in. World War II.,Dwight
"That's a really... well fine, Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?",Pam
"Deutsch... let me see here. That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.",Dwight
Hmm...,Pam
My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.,Dwight
"Pam, listen. This order form. Instead of saying 'Dunder Mifflin' at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?",Michael
Like Michael Scott Paper Company?,Pam
You... oh. Somebody has been talking in bed. Pillow talk.,Michael
Hmm... yeah. Listen Michael. Have you really thought this through? 'Cause it's a pretty big risk.,Pam
"This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.",Michael
Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.,Pam
"Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients. Half of them, at least. I can do it again. I know the market, I know the price points. I'm on it, don't worry. So, how do I do that?",Michael
"Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.",Pam
Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?,Michael
Yeah. Good.,Pam
Thank you very much.,Michael
Mmm-hmm,Pam
"So that is why I have to leave at 5: 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school. We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians..",Kelly
"You know, you can run this stuff by Toby.",Charles
Yeah I don't like talking... [knock on door],Kelly
Come in...,Charles
"I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone. I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about. Earlier.",Angela
"Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just...",Kelly
"Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar. I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim.",Angela
Did Michael just let anybody in his office?,Charles
"Yep! Yeah. He just loved having people, communicating all the time. He was like 'Come on in!'",Angela and Kelly
I am aware of the effect I have on woman.,Charles
So you should be heading back to your desk.,Kelly
Okay. Bye Charles. Well you'll let me know. Good bye.,Angela
She's such a special person. And she's turning 50 this year.,Kelly
I'm starting my own paper company.,Michael
No way!?,Andy
Yeah.,Michael
In this climate?,Andy
Yeah. In all climates. It's going to be worldwide. And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me. That's where you come in.,Michael
"Ehh... [in accent] well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it? Um... hmmm..[makes weird noises to stall, Dwight enters] Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?",Andy
Your own paper company.,Dwight
"Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so",Michael
Right...,Dwight
"Potential, lots of potential. yes.",Michael
What a courageous venture.,Dwight
"It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um...",Michael
"Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...",Dwight
"That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing.",Michael
Okay. So yeah.,Dwight
So think about it. Lets put a pin in it for now.,Michael
"You know, I would love to put a pin in that.",Dwight
"Everyone, can I have your attention. This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right? [drum roll on copier]",Pam
Little Ms. Thing wants attention.,Meredith
Meredith... [copier has an error] Oh... so uh... G-44. It's not ready Kevin!,Pam
"I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.",Pam
[bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it],Oscar
You put a note in my food?,Oscar
I made it sterile.,Michael
Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so.,Oscar
"I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.",Michael
"Do you have a business plan? A funding request? Market research, financials?",Oscar
"No, no no.",Michael
"You need those things. Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years. And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years. Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?",Oscar
Okay.,Michael
Five years?,Oscar
"Okay, hey, you already have the job. You don't have to convince me.",Michael
It's just not prudent Michael.,Oscar
[from inside the restroom] Stanley?,Michael
Can't you see I'm urinating?,Stanley
"Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don't have to answer me now.",Michael
No.,Stanley
"Just... I want you to think about it, I'm starting my own company.",Michael
No.,Stanley
"Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.",Michael
No I didn't.,Stanley
You know what. I had a great time at prom. And no one said 'Yes' to that either.,Michael
How's it working?,Pam
"Um, let's see... it's fine.",Phyllis
Good.,Pam
"I did it. I learned everything about this machine. I know all the buttons, even the inside ones. I know all the error messages. I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors. Which feels...",Pam
"Hey Hank, You ready?",Charles
Yeah.,Hank
"Okay, Michael?",Charles
Hmm?,Michael
"I can't pretend I haven't seen that. So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk out. And you can't take anything.",Charles
"Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks...",Michael
"not if you're starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank...",Charles
Okay Michael.,Hank
"Hank? You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you? Hank, please escort Charles from the building.",Michael
"Come on man, let's, let's go.",Hank
"I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy. And he's super funny. Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes. He's all the way over there.",Kevin
[to everyone] Well here we are... I would just like to...,Michael
"No, no no no. You're done, Michael.",Charles
"[yelling from Parking lot] Alright then everybody, I'm outta here!",Michael
[from behind the upstairs window] What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something.,Andy
I think he's singing.,Kevin
I can't believe this is really happening.,Oscar
... and I feel free!,Michael
"And just like that. As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building]",Oscar
"The whole office feels darker, you know? It's just a sad dark day.",Andy
Andy He's gone.,Phyllis
I know.,Andy
You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.,Phyllis
"Michael is like a movie on a plane. You know, it's not great, but it's something to watch. And when it's over you're like... how much time is left on this flight? Now what?",Toby
[Michael is Army crawling around the office] Michael?,Pam
"Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please!",Michael
These are for employees only.,Angela
"Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.",Michael
"Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?",Kevin
"I was going to, I wanted to. But I had to start somewhere.",Michael
But you didn't want to start with us?,Kevin
"No, of course not. But now I want everybody. Jim! Jim? Buddy, Hey! Buddy, Jimbo? Did you have time to think about my offer?",Michael
"I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.",Jim
So which way are you leaning?,Michael
Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.,Jim
Thanks Jim.,Michael
"Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on.",Charles
No.,Dwight
"Okay, let me know if you find it.",Charles
"Okay, Okay, we don't have much time. Just act normal. Don't look at me people. Stop. Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me. Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height. Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future. Hello, I am your future. You're older, and you are very happy now. Because you went with Michael Scott. Right. So everybody come on down. Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright? Come on! Are you, are you doing your best here? Are you being the best that you can be? [Pam is thinking hard] Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot. Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me. Come on Phyllis. Here we go, here we go!",Michael
Michael get up!,Charles
"Oh God... okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on!",Michael
"Michael, what are you doing?",Charles
I think maybe Hank should be here.,Michael
"Hank? No, I don't need Hank Michael.",Charles
"You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose. [Charles steps towards Michael] Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it.",Michael
Oh no.,Pam
What?,Jim
I'm going with him.,Pam
What? Pam!,Jim
I'm going.,Pam
Pam! You can't be serious.,Jim
"Michael, wait! I'm coming with you.",Pam
You are?,Michael
Yeah.,Pam
Okay. It's going to be great.,Michael
"Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore.",Pam
Right... Executive assistant.,Michael
Salesman.,Pam
"Alright, okay. Deal! Okay, well... Jim?",Michael
Still no.,Jim
"Well, okay, lets go.",Michael
"Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so...",Pam
Are people watching?,Michael
Probably.,Pam
"Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...",Jim
Jim Jim Jim... we're having a company meeting here.,Michael
"I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.",Jim
"Okay, see you later.",Pam
Bye.,Michael
"So, we had a personnel change today. Shouldn't effect our day to day. But, until we get a new receptionist I want Kevin on the phones.",Charles
Phones?,Kevin
"Also, there has been too much wasted time. So Stanley.",Charles
[holding a crossword puzzle] Yes.,Stanley
"Yeah, I want you to be on top of that okay? I want you to be my productivity czar. Okay, good. Uh, okay that it on my list. So uh, you know, no excuses guys. Lets get going okay? [everyone leaves except Kevin and Stanley, who are sitting stunned in their chairs]",Charles
"[phone ringing] You gonna answer that, Kev?",Jim
"Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom!",Kevin
Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.,Jim
Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call.,Kevin
"No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.",Jim
"Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.",Kevin
"It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.",Jim
"Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer.",Kevin
Here we go. [Meredith's phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.],Jim
"Oh, man!",Kevin
"It is 1-3-4, Kev! [Kevin runs to the phone]",Andy
"Kev, c'mon.",Jim
Hustle!,Dwight
Hold it.,Kevin
You are murdering the Nard-dog!,Andy

Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings],Kevin
Hey-o! [applauding and cheering],Andy
Way to go.,Dwight
My maid died.,Andy
"Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. [picks up piece of mail] Look, it's official! [door opens, Michael is in a bath robe]",Pam
"Oh, good. My hooker's here. [laughs] Hi.",Michael
"Michael, you were expecting me, right?",Pam
Yes I was. Yes I was.,Michael
Are you wearing anything under the robe?,Pam
"That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.",Michael
"This looks great, Michael.",Pam
Thank you. Would you like some french toast?,Michael
"Yes, please.",Pam
What shape?,Michael
... Square is fine.,Pam
Alright.,Michael
"Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael's replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns. [Kelly raises hand] Yeah.",Charles
Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton?,Kelly
"Eh, uh, in a hotel.",Charles
"Charles, where were you born?",Angela
"Actually, I meant questions more about the day-to-day operations of the company. Kay. [Andy raises hand] Yeah.",Charles
"How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day.",Andy
"Okay, let's go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? [Charles sees Stanley with his crossword, Charles stares and he puts it away] Thank you. So, umm...",Charles
[whispering] Would you please stop that?,Jim
What?,Dwight
You're breathing very heavily.,Jim
This is how I breathe.,Dwight
No it's not.,Jim
If you want to tell me -,Dwight
"Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front.",Charles
Oh no. I was just -,Jim
"No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear 'yes'.",Charles
... Yes.,Jim
Good. As I was saying...,Charles
Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! [smiles],Dwight
"So, what do you say we get started?",Pam
After breakfast.,Michael
I'm full.,Pam
So how you feeling about the new company?,Michael
I feel good. [sees a huge pile of French toast] Wow.,Pam
You excited? About the new company?,Michael
Yeah. I'm excited to start the company.,Pam
After breakfast.,Michael
"We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. [reaches out to take the whisk] Michael. Stop for a second.",Pam
"No, I'm whipping them.",Michael
"No, I know you are.",Pam
Just let go.,Michael
Just let me have... Oh.,Pam
"Let go, please. Just gimmee -",Michael
"Fine! [eggs splatter all over his robe] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",Pam
"I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.",Michael
I never see him drink. I never see him eat.,Phyllis
I don't think he even uses the bathroom.,Stanley
"Oh, he does. He does.",Creed
[doing situps] I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.,Michael
"You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -",Pam
"I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.",Michael
"I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.",Pam
Whatever calms you down.,Micheal
"Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. [Michael doing leg lifts] Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.",Pam
"Don't patronize me, Pam.",Michael
I think you should get dressed.,Pam
I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.,Michael
"Michael, that seems impossible.",Pam
It's totally impossible!,Michael
We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.,Pam
Assemble a sales team. A dream team.,Michael
Great.,Pam
"Okay, Ryan.",Michael
No. What? Why?,Pam
He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.,Michael
No. We're not gonna hire Ryan.,Pam
Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.,Michael
Okay.,Pam
He worked at that telemarketing place.,Michael
We'll find him.,Pam
"Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.",Michael
Really?,Pam
Yeah.,Michael
We have an investor already?,Pam
Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.,Michael
"Michael, that's fantastic.",Pam
"Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'. [sits down in robe, legs spread wide] Umm...",Michael
Hey! We need to get you dressed!,Pam
"I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let's go!",Pam
Alright.,Michael
[laughing at something on his computer],Andy
You a soccer fan?,Charles
Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.,Andy
"Well, that makes two of us.",Charles
No way!,Andy
Yeah.,Charles
I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner.,Andy
I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.,Charles
Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me!,Andy
"Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man.",Charles
Cool!,Andy
"I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.",Jim
Next on the list - open the mail.,Pam
"Oh. Wow. 'Michael Scott Paper Company.' Okay. Very official. 'Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence.'",Michael
"No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add 'find office'...",Pam
How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?,Michael
Next on the list -- song parodies.,Pam
Okay. Okay. 'Achey Breaky Fart.',Michael
Great. Let's sing it in the car.,Pam
No! No No. No. 'My Stumps.' Like 'My Humps' but a guy with no legs.,Michael
Yeah.,Pam
We can do this.,Michael
We can do this.,Pam
"Whoa! And he just goes, 'Boom'. [kicking motion] Goal!",Andy
Yep. Yep. That's Pele.,Charles
"You know your soccer, man.",Andy
I know. Yes I do.,Charles
I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.,Stanley
Oh yeah?,Charles
From Argentina.,Stanley
"I didn't know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office.",Charles
"I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but...",Andy
"What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?",Charles
"Uh, no. Nope. Not really.",Jim
"Well, it's not for everybody I suppose. [Andy laughs]",Charles
It's 'cause I'm more of a player.,Jim
Yeah?,Charles
You bet.,Jim
"Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.",Dwight
Well I do.,Jim
Wow.,Dwight
I play.,Jim
You can be so modest sometimes.,Dwight
"Well, maybe you should get back to work.",Jim
Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.,Dwight
Maybe we will someday.,Jim
Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?,Dwight
"That's a great idea, Dwight.",Charles
Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.,Dwight
Yeah.,Jim
I don't try and be anything that I'm not.,Dwight
"What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?",Charles
"Jim, what do you say?",Dwight
Sounds fun.,Angela
I'm in it to win.,Andy
Game on!,Dwight
"Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.",Charles
Let's... eh... see ya.,Jim
"See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can't wait!",Charles
"Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.",Jim
"[Michael comes out with Vikram, arms raised] We got Vikram!",Pam
You got me.,Vikram
Where are we going?,Vikram
We have a meeting with an investor today.,Pam
"Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back. [gets out of the car] Ah, okay.",Michael
He seems really confident.,Vikram
He can be.,Pam
Confidence. It's the food of the wise man but the liquor of the fool.,Vikram
"Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.",Pam
"Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. [Ryan is working at the bowling alley] It's Michael.",Michael
"I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.",Ryan
"Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.",Michael
"He's taking a long time. Is it possible he's bowling? I mean, you know him better than I do.",Vikram
"Yes. Yes, it's possible.",Pam
"Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.",Michael
Michael! What's going on?,Pam
I'm...,Michael
"Hey, Ryan.",Pam
"Hey, you.",Ryan
Excuse me. Yes?,Michael
This wasn't on the list.,Pam
"Yes, it is.",Michael
No.,Pam
Yes.,Michael
It's not.,Pam
It is.,Michael
[looks at list] When did you add this to the list?,Pam
"Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. [walks back to Ryan] Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?",Michael
Sixty thousand dollars a year.,Ryan
You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?,Pam
"What do you make, secretary?",Ryan
"Back to work, shoe bitch!",Supervisor
"I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...",Ryan
Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?,Michael
What size shoes are you guys?,Ryan
"Uh, nine.",Michael
"What are those, a men's ten?",Ryan
No.,Pam
[Ryan grabs some shoes] Look what he's doing.,Michael
What is he doing?,Pam
"He's stealing them. Okay, okay.",Michael
Oh my God.,Pam
He's already paying for himself.,Michael
Sorry!,Pam
Where is it?,Ryan
Right here.,Michael
"Hey, c'mon, guys. These are prime selling hours, you know.",Vikram
Miner - [kicking a piece of trash],Charles
"Oh, there he goes.",Jim
...sees his partner -,Charles
Yikes.,Jim
Halpert. He looks up!,Charles
"Aw, man.",Jim
Defending duo! He sets him up! [Jim moves the piece of trash with his hands] He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho!,Charles
Oh! Goal!,Jim
"Aw, man, I can't wait to play with you.",Charles
"Aw, it's gonna be the [softly] worst.",Jim
Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?,Ryan
Oh yeah.,Michael
Sure.,Pam
It was indescribable.,Ryan
Sounds awesome.,Michael
Beat.,Pam
What sort of investing club is this?,Vikram
"Vikram, you ask a lot of questions and I like that. Hey, Nana! Hi!",Michal
[mouthing to camera] Nana?,Pam
Michael!,Nana
"People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.",Michael
"Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey! [snaps in front of sleeping old man] I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.",Michael
So let's hear it.,Nana
"Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.",Michael
How do you expect to turn a profit in this economy?,Nana
By wanting it more. By working hard-,Michael
What's your mission statement?,Nana
Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.,Michael
"C'mon, Oscar. What positions do people play?",Charles
Wing.,Dwight
Wag.,Kevin
Jim. What do you play?,Charles
Left.,Jim
Forward or half?,Charles
"Forward, definitely.",Jim
"Okay, striker, huh?",Chares
Striker!,Jim
Let's see what you got in those legs!,Charles
Alright! Let's do it.,Jim
"Alright. [Dwight blows whistle in Jim's face] No, no, no. That's supposed to be the kickoff.",Charles
Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping],Jim
"And I offer same day, free delivery.",Michael
"Michael, I don't know about this.",Nana
Nana. [softly] I really think that Papa would want you to do this.,Michael
I'm not so sure.,Nana
"Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...",Michael
"See, this is what concerns me.",Nana
We could just give him a chance. It's not much money.,Old Woman
"Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.",Michael
This isn't a handout club. It's an investment club!,Nana
Okay.,Michael
"I love you, Michael. I do.",Nana
Okay.,Michael
But no. I mean it. No.,Nana
I thought Nana raised some good questions. What kind of a name is Nana?,Vikram
It means grandmother.,Pam
"Oh, sweet Jesus. Look, I'm sorry to do this, but can you drop me back at the telemarketing building?",Vikram
"You know, Michael? You want to succeed? You got to apply the same- [Michael slams door]",Vikram
"Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim. [Charles kicks, ball hits Phyllis in the nose]",Andy
"Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the?",Charles
"Phyllis, Phyllis.",Oscar
"Phyllis, are you okay? Are, you okay?",Charles
"[muffled] No, I swallowed a crown.",Phyllis
"Why'd you duck, Jim?",Charles
What?,Jim
"Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?",Dwight
"Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.",Jim
Does that make you feel better? Huh?,Charles
"I'm sorry, Phyllis.",Jim
"Oh, yeah. Jim's sorry.",Charles
Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?,Ryan
"Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. [to Pam] Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.",Michael
I can't do this.,Pam
What's that?,Michael
I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.,Pam
Blech.,Michael
"I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?",Pam
Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.,Michael
We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.,Pam
"Well we should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. [Pam tosses list out car window] Okay...",Michael
"How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!",Pam
"I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.",Michael
Yeah.,Pam
"So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? [Pam nods]",Michael
"You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.",Michael
"I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up. She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine.",Michael
[walks into room] Okay.,Michael
I could work here. I could see this.,Pam
It's right in the middle of the paper belt.,Michael
Are you good?,Pam
"Yeah, I'm good. You good?",Michael
I'm good.,Pam
"You know what they say, keep your friends close. [pointing to office sign where 'Dunder Mifflin' is listed right above 'Michael Scott Pap']",Michael
"Michael, you're back.",Charles
"Yes, I am, Charles.",Michael
Mmmhmm.,Charles
"Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin. [Pam and Michael stare him down, he walks away] Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.",Michael
"It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company. [tries to parallel park, hits car.] Okay. Not gonna make this one. [drives away revealing plenty of space for the Cruiser]",Michael
LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair],Jim
Morning Michael!,Pam
Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride! [awkwardly climbs out of his car],Michael
"I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. [nips mylar ribbon with hedge clippers, it won't cut, he tears it down] Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!",Michael
So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...,Kelly
"You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?",Jim
And...,Kelly
Hey Kelly?,Charles
"Yes? Charles, you wanted me?",Kelly
"Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in]",Charles
"The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.",Jim
"Oh, and Kelly...",Charles
"Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me?",Kelly
"Okay, I'm gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon.",Charles
"If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.",Erin
"Erin. Okay, that's very pretty.",Charles
Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!,Kelly
I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?,Kevin
We are in the heart of it. [Bathroom sounds rattle the small office.] And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.,Michael
What should we do now?,Pam
"We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.",Michael
"I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.",Michael
"I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. [He sets sheet between Pam and Ryan on desk. Neither takes it.]",Michael
"I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet.",Pam
What do you think?,Andy
Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.,Dwight
Thank you!,Andy
"Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much. But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.",Dwight
"You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.",Ryan
Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.,Michael
"Please don't listen to my phone calls. Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.",Ryan
"Hey Jim can I get a, um-",Charles
Hi! [Awkward],Jim
"Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.",Charles
Sure!,Jim
Yeah.,Charles
Okay.,Jim
What the hell's a rundown?,Jim
When did you need that rundown by?,Jim
As soon as possible.,Charles
Okay.,Jim
Just get it right.,Charles
"Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?",Jim
Oh.,Erin
You know there's a ghost in this office,Dwight
Really?,Erin
A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.,Dwight
Why was she in this building?,Erin
"Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.",Dwight
That's crazy.,Erin
Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.,Dwight
Oh my god!,Erin
It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?,Dwight
Hmm.,Erin
"That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next. [Taps her shoulder]",Dwight
Oh! [Dwight and Erin laugh.],Erin
Just kidding. You finding everything okay?,Dwight
Yeah.,Erin
Yeah?,Dwight
Just got some ice.,Erin
Erin [eerie voice] Erin...,Dwight
"Oh, this is awkward. [Andy and Erin 'dance' trying to get out of each other's way]",Andy
Oops!,Erin
Uh oh! Oh! Oh! [Andy improvs musical verbage],Andy
So I'll see you guys around!,Erin
Hey buddy.,Dwight
Hey Ryan? [Ryan watches Montgomery Flea Market ad on YouTube] Could you get to that copy from before?,Michael
Pam's better at that stuff,Ryan
That is so insulting.,Pam
How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?,Ryan
"Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.",Pam
"I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not saying one is better than the other.",Ryan
Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.,Pam
What the hell? [Michael closed his laptop],Ryan
"Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals.",Michael
Yeah I make originals too.,Ryan
Shut up!,Pam
Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!,Michael
Really!,Pam
Yeah!,Ryan
"Not much? What's up with you? [from bathroom above] Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO. [sound of pissing] Hey does blue go with tan?",Toby
Would someone just make the copy?,Michael
"I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.",Toby
Just make that copy okay?,Michael
"Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?",Pam
That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.,Ryan
I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.,Pam
You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.,Ryan
Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?,Pam
This is from the sun.,Ryan
Oh yeah I bet.,Pam
"They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.",Michael
"Michael, we can hear you.",Pam
"I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B.",Michael
Okay it's my turn.,Pam
"No don't take that, give that back!",Ryan
Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?,Pam
I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.,Ryan
You're gonna make another 'spreadsheet.',Pam
Yeah!,Ryan
Yeah exactly. It's my turn.,Pam
"Go make a copy, secretary.",Ryan
Come on! Ryan!,Pam
"They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?",Michael
"Hey buddy, what are you up to?",Dwight
"Um, nerthing?",Andy
"Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.",Dwight
Pffft.,Andy
"Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?",Dwight
"The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.",Andy
"And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.",Dwight
"No, that's ridiculous.",Andy
No no no.,Dwight
"Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-",Andy
"Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom.",Dwight
Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.,Michael
Definitely.,Pam
Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.,Michael
We could work from home.,Pam
Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.,Ryan
"Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right? 1,2,3- What are we gonna do?",Michael
.... Corner idea?,Pam
"No, you're supposed to say, 'Rock the house.'",Michael
Rock the house!,Ryan
How would we know that?,Pam
"Hey dude, you know what a 'rundown' is?",Jim
Use it in a sentence.,Oscar
"Uh, can you get this rundown for me?' [impersonating Charles]",Jim
Try another sentence.,Oscar
This rundown better be really good'?,Jim
I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.,Oscar
Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.,Jim
Why don't you just ask him--,Oscar
"No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.",Jim
What have you been doing?,Oscar
Try it in another sentence.,Kevin
"Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.",Ryan
That's my corner.,Michael
I thought that was your corner.,Pam
"No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.",Michael
So my corner's the one with the copier?,Pam
"Pam, I don't make the rules. [Pam walks out.]",Michael
"Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.",Ryan
You started on that rundown yet? [Looks at Jim's screen.],Charles
"Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.",Jim
Oh.,Charles
"I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.",Jim
"Okay, great.",Charles
"Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?",Jim
Just keep it simple.,Charles
Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.,Jim
You're working hard? On this?,Charles
No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.,Jim
Right. I mean why work harder than you should.,Charles
"No, I....",Jim
Can I help you?,Erin
No thanks.,Pam
Hey!,Jim
Hey I'm here to see Charles.,Pam
Okay.,Jim
Hey Charles.,Pam
Hey Pam.,Charles
I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back.,Pam
I don't know what to tell you. The job's been taken.,Charles
"Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.",Pam
Um.,Charles
"Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.",Pam
Yeah I know.,Charles
Personal shopper?,Pam
No.,Charles
Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.,Pam
Okay.,Charles
I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.,Pam
"Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.",Michael
I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more?,Stanley
It's really cute.,Phyllis
Thank you. You remember Ryan [Stanley laughs deeply] And Pam is around here somewhere.,Michael
She's upstairs talking to Charles.,Stanley
What for?,Michael
I don't know. [They shrug and leave.],Stanley
Are we staying til five?,Ryan
Yes.,Michael
"Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That'll show 'em.",Michael
"Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary. [Flips a pancake. It's about 8x11 inches] Young sir, would you like a free pancake?",Michael
I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.,Ryan
"Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company.",Michael
Hey Pam.,Michael
Hey.,Pam
You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?,Michael
"Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.",Pam
Yeah?,Michael
That's as specific as I'd like to be.,Pam
"Well, at least you're still being honest with me.",Michael
There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.,Jim
Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.,Charles
Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?,Jim
Do I need to?,Charles
"No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?",Jim
What's that?,Charles
The one I have. I'll use the one I have.,Jim
Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.,Jim
"We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves.",Pam
Do you have a card?,Man
"Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper.",Pam
These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.,Creed
These are shaped like paper.,Michael
Well I don't even want these. [Takes the rectangle pancakes out of his coat.],Creed
I'll take them for my kid.,Meredith
"Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good!",Erin
You're good.,Dwight
Thank you.,Erin
"That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like [Andy plays Country Roads on his banjo.]",Andy
Wow!,Erin
What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.,Andy
"Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.",Dwight
Really?,Andy
Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...,Dwight
"West Virginia, Blue Ridge mountain, Shenandoah River [Andy vocalizes]",Dwight and Erin
"In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend",Dwight
"Take me home, country roads, to the place, I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads. [Erin leaves]",Dwight and Andy
"Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh",Dwight
You have to stop. [bangs on glass window],Toby
"I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting. [The phone rings] It is a disgusting sandwich. [It rings again.] And the reason I tell you this story. [phone] Pick up the phone.",Michael
"Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?",Pam
Keep going. [Whispers],Ryan
Don't tell them we have free delivery! [Also whispers],Michael
We already offered free delivery!,Pam
They don't know that!,Michael
"Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!",Pam
Write it down.,Ryan
Give him a guarantee.,Michael
A guarantee of what?,Pam
Just say the word.,Michael
"And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.",Pam
Yes!,Michael
I made a sale!,Pam
Oh!,Ryan
You did!,Michael
Oh!,Pam
Oh yeah!,Michael
We did it !,Ryan
She did it!,Michael
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Dancing in the office],Michael
"Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really [flushing] Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important.",Michael
Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.,Andy
"Cherry Pie, Warrant.",Dwight
Better a cappella!,Andy
No! Really?,Dwight
Yeah. Name another.,Andy
"Enter Sandman, Metallica.",Dwight
Better a cappella.,Andy
"Rebel Yell, Billy Idol",Dwight
Aw!! Way better a cappella,Andy
Really?,Dwight
Yeah.,Andy
Hup! [throws cheese puff to Ryan who catches it in his mouth],Michael
Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.,Pam
Hup! [throws cheese puff to Pam who catches it in her mouth],Michael
We're getting pretty good at it.,Pam
"Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right.",Jim
The timeline's messy.,Pam
"Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.",Jim
"This is my solo. [stereo plays Andy imitating bass guitar, a cappella starts singing 'You Can Call Me Al']",Andy
I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?',Pam
Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.,Andy
"I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?",Jim
"Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000.",Andy
I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.,Pam
Did you even hear the music I just played for you?,Andy
Mm-hmm.,Pam
What's wrong with you?,Phyllis
These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.,Dwight
I think you look nice.,Phyllis
Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.,Dwight
Looking good.,Charles
"Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay.",Dwight
"When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.",Dwight
Hey.,Michael
Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.,Dwight
[gestures to 'Bed & Breakfast' magazine] Is this good?,Michael
They have some great kitchen ideas.,Dwight
"Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh?",Michael
"It's small, I know.",Dwight
I really appreciate it.,Michael
"Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this?",Dwight
It's for your trouble.,Michael
Wh- I don't need $6 to help a friend.,Dwight
"No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.",Michael
"Michael, you know I can't take this.",Dwight
"Yes, I do.",Michael
But don't forget you owe me $10.,Dwight
That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?,Michael
Michael.,Dwight
What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?,Andy
I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.,Jim
It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.,Andy
Am I going down a road?,Jim
"When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.",Andy
"It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.",Jim
"I know a few things about love. Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.",Andy
"I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.",Jim
"Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.",Michael
I'm not gonna do that.,Pam
That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?,Michael
I can get there.,Ryan
"Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.",Michael
"Oh, awesome.",Ryan
Bring it in. Morning cheer. [clears throat],Michael
"U-G-L-Y, you ain't got no alibi! You ugly, huh huh, you ugly! You mama says you ugly! Hey! Go Michael Scott Paper Company!","Michael, Pam & Ryan"
I'm here. I'm a part of this now.,Pam
You needed to speak to me?,Dwight
"Dwight, take a seat.",Charles
I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.,Dwight
"Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?",Charles
Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.,Dwight
I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.,Charles
Your concern is noted.,Dwight
"Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused.",Charles
Like a wolf. Thank you.,Dwight
And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?,Charles
Really?,Dwight
Definitely.,Charles
[sighs] It's firm.,Dwight
[on phone] I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.,Michael
"I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.",Dwight
Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?,Michael
"No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.",Dwight
I'm not following you.,Michael
"Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.",Dwight
"Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift.",Michael
"Good, do you see what I'm saying?",Dwight
Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?,Michael
No.,Dwight
Can I use it? [Pam holds up note saying 'He's talking about you!'],Michael
No.,Dwight
"[Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us?",Michael
It is possible that I could be talking about us.,Dwight
Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?,Michael
It is the situation that we are in now.,Dwight
"So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?",Michael
I'm not a barbarian.,Dwight
Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?,Michael
I will.,Dwight
Dwight?,Michael
Yes?,Dwight
Is the cool new guy Charles?,Michael
I've said too much.,Dwight
Is it Stanley?,Michael
"Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-",Jim
Noishe.',Andy
-I just don't know if I can do it.,Jim
"That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?",Andy
"It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.",Jim
"And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. [imitates punching on Jim's fist] Ah, what'd you do that for?",Andy
[both laugh] You know that I was doin' this.,Jim
[fist pound each other] Totally.,Andy
Okay.,Jim
"Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?",Michael
"I'm sorry, Michael",Dwight
"[Charles comes from around corner] Hi, Michael.",Charles
Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!,Michael
"No, Mich-Michael.",Charles
"Dwight, run!",Michael
"Michael, no, let's be cool, ok?",Charles
You be cool.,Michael
Yes.,Charles
Just-what's going on?,Michael
"We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info.",Charles
Mm-do... Dwight would not-,Michael
He did.,Charles
"I did, Michael. I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.",Dwight
"Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?",Charles
I. Understand. Nothing.,Michael
[Michael storms into office] Wow.,Michael
"Michael, are you alright?",Pam
It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.,Michael
Tell us what you're talking about.,Pam
Yeah.,Ryan
"It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.",Michael
We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.,Pam
"I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?",Michael
"Hey, Jim.",Andy
[Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.,Jim
"Bro, I do that all the time.",Andy
"Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!",Jim
"Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?",Andy
"Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.",Jim
"Well, so what? Your body's a ten.",Andy
Forget it.,Jim
Jim.,Andy
"I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]",Jim
[on phone] Dwight Schrute.,Dwight
"Hello, traitor.",Michael
"I think you have the wrong number, Michael.",Dwight
"I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.",Michael
Michael!,Pam
I'm just getting hardcore with him.,Michael
Finally.,Ryan
"Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. [hangs up] Bill Cosby.",Michael
"[on phone] Mr. Schofield, please?",Dwight
He's in a meeting.,Secretary
Dammit! [hangs up],Dwight
[on phone] Is Mr. Schofield there?,Michael
"If you'd like to reach an outside line, please dial nine first. [Michael sighs, hangs up phone]",Automated phone voice
"So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?",Stanley
I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.,Dwight
You sound worried.,Phyllis
"And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! [gibberish sounds]",Dwight
"[on phone] Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes. [referencing rolodex card] Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?",Michael
Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.,Ryan
"I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.",Pam
Wow. High score?,Michael
"And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.",Dwight
"Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market. So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...",Dwight
"Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?",Michael
I would like to arrange a truce.,Dwight
"So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?",Michael
Meet me in our spot in four minutes.,Dwight
No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-,Michael
Michael.,Dwight
"Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.",Michael
In which direction?,Dwight
Toward the sun.,Michael
At what time?,Dwight
Noon.,Michael
That-,Dwight
You have two seconds. [Dwight starts running],Michael
[looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry.,Dwight
Dwight.,Michael
Michael.,Dwight
I hope you're not recording this conversation. [Dwight drops his pants and lifts up his shirt] Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.,Michael
You were making me do things that were not all right.,Dwight
So you just rat me out? You could have said no.,Michael
And not come through for you?,Dwight
"If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.",Michael
I want a truce.,Dwight
I do too.,Michael
Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.,Dwight
Cooper's.,Michael
I had fish yesterday.,Dwight
Damn it.,Michael
"[Michael, Ryan and Pam sitting at restaurant, phone rings] Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?",Michael
"Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.",Dwight
Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.,Michael
I hit a bear.,Dwight
What?,Michael
"He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael's office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?",Dwight
"Yeah, sure.",Michael
"Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael's desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex]",Dwight
"Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec.",Michael
"[Pam, Ryan and Michael enter office] Sounds neat.",Pam
We can spend a couple days there.,Ryan
"Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!",Pam
[Michael answers phone] Yeah.,Michael
Did you enjoy your lunch?,Dwight
"Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.",Michael
"No, Michael, you were sabotaged.",Dwight
"No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. [Pam holds up sign saying 'Dwight did it!!'] You?",Michael
Me.,Dwight
What about our truce?,Michael
I broke it.,Dwight
On purpose?,Michael
Yes.,Dwight
Why?,Michael
"You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!",Dwight
"Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.",Michael
And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!,Dwight
"Oh. [bites into sandwich, looks disgusted] Bastard!",Michael
"Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.",Dwight
"[holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, 'great salesman, better friend.' [turns card over] 'Tall' and 'beets.'",Dwight
"And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you're begging for mercy, huh? Well, you will find none here.",Dwight
"Dwight, do you mind if we talk?",Michael
Sure. That'd be fine.,Dwight
"If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.",Michael
This is war and that is what happens.,Dwight
"Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.",Michael
"Oh, no. No. No. No. No.",Dwight
"Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.",Michael
Michael! Michael!,Dwight
"You can hear me, but I can't hear you.",Michael
"Mr. Schofield's ready to see you now, Mr. Scott.",Secretary
"Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.",Michael
Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!,Dwight
Walking in the door...,Michael
"Michael, good to see you.",Mr. Schofield
"Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door. [Dwight runs out of the office]",Michael
"[on speakerphone in Dwight's car] Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.",Michael
Really?,Mr. Schofield
"Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.",Michael
Are you saying you invented paper?,Dwight
"[hugging a crying Jim] Okay, okay.",Andy
"Oh, God.",Jim
"Okay, Tuna.",Andy
"Hey, guys.",Kelly
Hey.,Jim
Hello.,Andy
"Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now.",Andy
I guess I could be nicer.,Kevin
"Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.",Phyllis
"Oh, really?",Andy
Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen],Phyllis
Okay.,Jim
"Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?",Andy
"Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.",Jim
"Uh, that's not what was-",Andy
"And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.",Jim
"Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.",Andy
What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?,Michael
It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office],Dwight
"Uh, hello, Dwight.",Secretary
Spin move.,Dwight
Oh-,Secretary
"Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.",Dwight
"Dwight, I'm in a meeting.",Mr. Schofield
That's very rude.,Michael
"I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.",Dwight
Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our-,Mr. Schofield
"La la la! Continuing. Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!",Dwight
"I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...",Michael
Come on.,Dwight
"Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.",Michael
What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.,Dwight
Why don't you guys just e-mail me your best offers and we can finish it up that way?,Mr. Schofield
That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.,Michael
"Uh, ok, sure.",Mr. Schofield
"Good, good, good. I will see you.",Michael
"Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?",Dwight
Excuse me?,Mr. Schofield
"I color code all my info. I wrote 'gay son' in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means 'Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?' Most colors mean 'Don't say it.'",Michael
"How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?",Dwight
"I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.",Michael
"He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good. And if a friend can't make you feel good, then I don't want any friends. Except Dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.",Michael
Dwight just got Howard Family Dry Cleaners.,Michael
Uncle Dave?,Ryan
He's undercutting us big time. He's actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket.,Michael
"That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.",Ryan
When are you ever responsible for your actions?,Pam
"Get off my ass, you hag.",Ryan
"Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.",Michael
Betrayal ain't just a river in Egypt.,Michael
"Who is that knocking on my taste buds? Why, it's Mr. Lemon. Hmmm, nice to meet you.",Andy
It's good. But won't it feel weird cutting into a cross?,Pam
"Don't think of it as a cross in the Judeo-Christian sense, think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage.",Andy
"When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.",Jim
Yes!,Andy
"I don't think so, Andy.",Pam
Sorry. Her day.,Jim
"Hey, bud.",Andy
Are they looking at me?,Jim
Who?,Andy
Everyone. Everyone just keeps looking at me.,Jim
Are you sure?,Andy
"Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!",Jim
"It's 4:30 in the morning. Do you know where your kids are? If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do. They're gonna be in this van. With me. Who am I? Nothing to fear. I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.",Michael
"[honking horn] Time to make the donuts. [laughs and drives away as Ryan tries to get in the van] Come on. Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again. Come on. [does it again] De-nied!",Michael
We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now. Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.,Ryan
"Hello! Time to make the donuts! Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts! [laughs] Hey Pam.",Michael
We got the van at a used car lot. We think it says 'Alleluia Church of Scranton.' in Korean. It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.,Pam
"You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?",Pam
Milk and sugar.,Michael
"Oh, awesome. You're a life saver. [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?",Pam
That's what I said.,Michael
Do you drink this every day?,Pam
Every morning.,Michael
"We're, uh, we're doing okay. A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun. Uh, yep. We have 20-- of those.",Michael
"[an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me! Sorry. Sorry, no. It's, uh, it's a paper company now. It's not for the church.",Pam
"Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming?",Charles
"Oh, they're my client.",Jim
"No, they were your client. They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company.",Charles
"[sighs] Shame, Jim. I expected more.",Dwight
In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott.,Charles
What are we supposed to do? They keep undercutting us on price.,Stanley
I don't want to hear excuses. I want to see improvements. This is unacceptable.,Charles
"Hey, Boss. Uh, I'd just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys.",Andy
Why are you telling me this?,Charles
I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.,Andy
Is this something you really want to have said?,Charles
I don't want to have said that. But I think it's important that you know it.,Andy
"I don't know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it's my fault-",Charles
It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.,Dwight
"I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh--",Charles
"Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports. Waste not, want not.",Angela
"Uh, well said, Angela.",Charles
"Been there, done that.",Dwight
You know what we need? We need some couches in here.,Michael
"Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.",Ryan
"Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.",Michael
Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?,Pam
"Like in a dorm room. You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top. You can sleep up top.",Michael
"Yeah, I know what a loft is.",Pam
Most dorm rooms don't even have that.,Ryan
Most do in the magazines.,Michael
Let's see what a delivery guy costs.,Ryan
We should look into that. Or we just go for the loft.,Michael
"Would you let Charles know that David is here, please? Jim, hey.",David Wallace
"Hey, David.",Jim
"David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace. Charles and I were waiting for you.",Dwight
There he is. There he is. How was the trip up?,Charles
"A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure.",David
"Oh, you know it hasn't been that bad. Hasn't been that bad. These people are the salt of the earth down here. You couldn't ask for a better way to learn a company.",Charles
Hmmm.,David
I feel like I should be thanking you.,Charles
Uh.,David
"[makes kissing, puckering sound]",Jim
The conference room is ready if we want to get started.,Charles
"You know, I just want to address everyone first.",David
"Oh yeah, take your time. Stanley, pay attention.",Charles
"Hi, everyone.",David
Hi.,Kelly
"Hi. Uh, look it's no secret--",David
Hi.,Kevin
"Hello. Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business. And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.",David
Right.,Charles
Okay?,David
"Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.",Phyllis
"I've been wondering that myself lately. We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured. Jim, can you come in with us please?",David
"Uh, Jim hold on. [whispers] You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy. Okay?",Charles
Hmm.,David
"Yeah, Jim--",Charles
I find that extraordinarily surprising.,David
"He shows promise and Jim, I don't know-- I-- he's been a disappointment.",Charles
We'll bring them both in.,David
"Okay, great. Uh, Dwight come on in. Also, Jim.",Charles
"Come along, afterthought.",Dwight
How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?,Michael
"Well, if these numbers you gave me are correct--",Financial Guy
"They are correct, sir.",Michael
Then you can't afford to pay him anything.,Financial Guy
Okay. A lame attempt at humor. Swing and a miss.,Michael
Your prices are too low.,Financial Guy
Lowest in town.,Michael
Why do you think Staples and Dunder Mifflin can't match your prices?,Financial Guy
Corporate greed?,Pam
"Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself. Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.",Ryan
"Yeah, with a fixed cost pricing model that's correct.",Financial Guy
Yeah.,Ryan
But you need to use a variable cost pricing model.,Financial Guy
"Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is.",Michael
Explain what you think that is.,Ryan
Okay.,Financial Guy
Explain that.,Michael
"As you sell more paper and your company grows, so will your costs. For example, delivery man, health care...",Financial Guy
"Well, we don't--",Michael
...business expansion--,Financial Guy
"Whatever, yeah.",Michael
"At these prices, the more paper you sell, the less money you'll make.",Financial Guy
Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.,Michael
They're actually putting you out of business.,Financial Guy
"Okay, okay. Hold on, hold on. Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.",Michael
It's a program. There's no such thing--,Ty
Just crunch 'em. Just crunch 'em please.,Michael
[presses key on computer] Crunch.,Ty
Did it help?,Pam
"Hi, Jerry. Michael Scott. Well, this is slightly embarrassing. [laughs] Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday. Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check.",Michael
"When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child. He didn't know any better. You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, 'Drive, kid. I trust you.'",Pam
"Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?",Jim
"God, no.",Charles
"Stupid. Yeah, makes us look weak.",Dwight
I agree.,Charles
I say we fill Michael's office with bees. My apiarist owes me a favor.,Dwight
Really? Does he do good work or--,Jim
"[scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]",Dwight
"Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.",David
Five minutes exactly.,Dwight
"Okay. Hey, Dwight. Can I talk to you?",Charles
Sure thing.,Dwight
Yeah.,Charles
[opens phone] Hey. I saw you called.,Jim
You're just out of business?,Jim
We have maybe a month. I don't know what I'm gonna do.,Pam
"Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it. We'll figure it out. We'll be okay.",Jim
That's what Michael said.,Pam
"Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay. [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying 'Idiot, Idiot, Idiot'] Oh, that's my new 'Dwight' ring.",Jim
I like it.,Pam
"Good, right? Hello.",Jim
"[over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up. This is Dwight, by the way.",Dwight
"Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.",Jim
Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?,Michael
"Steve Martin's not dead, Michael.",Pam
I know. But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life. I was wrong. It's this.,Michael
You want to hear something sad?,Pam
I would love that.,Michael
"So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive. So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money. I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart. None of 'em called me back. Not even for an interview.",Pam
I never went to Thailand.,Ryan
Really?,Pam
I went to Fort Lauderdale.,Ryan
Was it nice?,Michael
"Yeah, it was amazing. There was a great Pad Thai place, though.",Ryan
I love Pad Thai.,Michael
You've never had Pad Thai.,Ryan
No. There's a lot I haven't done.,Michael
"Now, this is the projection over three months?",Jim
We still have the inventory sitting-- [everyone starts chattering at once],Charles
"Let me float something out there, okay? Can I just say-- can I say something?",Dwight
"Yeah, yeah.",David
"There is a hive of bees outside the front door. We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.",Dwight
"I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer.",David
"Yes. Yes, I was gonna say the same thing. We should buy him out.",Charles
"Oh, but you didn't.",Jim
"Oh, Man! If only Michael had children. That's how you really apply the pressure.",Dwight
What is wrong with you?,Charles
"Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him. You think they'd be up for hearing an offer?",David
"Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--",Jim
Yeah.,David
I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.,Jim
"You know what? Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me. I'm the man for this job. Charles, you got my back on this?",Dwight
"No, Jim... I think you should go.",Charles
"Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.",Jim
[knocking on door] Hmm?,Michael
"Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?",Jim
"We're not hiring, Jim.",Michael
Actually here for something else.,Jim
"Listen, I can't make you laugh right now.",Michael
"You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for? Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.",Jim
"Oh, that's nice.",Ryan
David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.,Jim
Seriously? Are you being serious?,Pam
"He's bluffing, Pam.",Ryan
"Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl--",Michael
Oh!,Jim
No-- We don't have--,Michael
Oh! See I'm here to learn as little information as possible. All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.,Jim
[stammers] Uh... Yes.,Michael
Yes.,Pam
Maybe.,Ryan
Three yeses. I will see you titans of industry upstairs.,Jim
"Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.",Michael
Missed the last part.,Jim
That's a pun.,Michael
Got it.,Jim
Yep. Oh... wow.,Michael
"Okay, so you are not going to reveal in any way that we're broke.",Ryan
Of course not.,Michael
That we're having any problem at all.,Ryan
"Nope, nope, nope.",Michael
"Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.",Pam
"Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke.",Michael
"Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it.",Michael
"No, Michael.",Pam
Ah...,Michael
"No, man. You're-- you're fine.",Ryan
We have to come from a position of strength.,Pam
"I'm good, I'm good.",Michael
Just put it out of your mind.,Ryan
It is. I'm good.,Michael
Hello.,Michael
Hi.,Erin
"Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace. I believe we're expected. [David and Charles walk out of conference room] Well, well, well. How the turntables...",Michael
"Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.",David
And we are prepared to reject that offer.,Michael
"Michael, you haven't even heard--",Ryan
Never accept their first offer. What is your second offer?,Michael
"$12,000.00 ",David
Are you kidding me? That is insultingly low. I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.,Michael
What do you hear?,Angela
[mumbles],Kelly
"Here's the situation. Your company is four weeks old. I know this business. I know what suppliers are charging. I know you can't be making very much money. I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way. I'm sure you're scared. Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get.",David
I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation. Your company is losing clients left and right. You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding. So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO. So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin. I think I just have to wait out you.,Michael
"Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000. Hmm? $60,0000. Michael?",David
[stutters] We'll have to talk--,Michael
What?,Charles
We'll have to talk about this.,Ryan
Mm-hmm.,Pam
Just amongst ourselves.,Michael
"Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside. Take your time.",David
"Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",Michael
"$60,000.00 ",Pam
We are so rich.,Michael
Are you kidding me?,Pam
"Well, Jerry, the one who got away. May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company? Really? Please hold. [gets up and runs to kitchen] Charles.",Dwight
Dwight.,Charles
May I have your attention? The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.,Dwight
What? How'd you hear that?,Charles
They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money. That can only mean one thing. They're desperate. Which can only mean one thing. They're total failures.,Dwight
Great work Dwight.,Jim
Quiet you.,Dwight
"No, I mean, great detective work. 'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?",Jim
"You don't crack a case. That has pejorative connotation. That's like calling a policeman a cop. You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.",Dwight
So how long can they stay viable?,Charles
What are your top five cases?,Jim
I'm gonna answer Charles first.,Dwight
Because you've solved zero cases.,Jim
"Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit. Missing beets from all over the farm. No footprints. Inside job. Mose in socks. Boom, case closed.",Dwight
"Okay, do not go anywhere near the conference room.",Charles
Done.,Dwight
Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today. Got it?,Charles
I'm not-- I'm not following you.,Dwight
You two are morons.,Charles
Got it.,Jim
Wh--,Dwight
Get out.,Charles
"So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer. We can finally put this whole thing behind us? Hmm?",David
No.,Michael
Can you give us another minute please?,Pam
Yeah.,David
"Oh, okay.",Charles
Michael.,Pam
"How could you do this to me, Michael? You just cost me $60,000.",Ryan
Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?,Pam
"It's a lot of money, okay. But we need money coming in every week. We need jobs. Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?",Michael
"I would rather have $60,000, honestly.",Ryan
"No, Michael's right. Jobs are safer.",Pam
Agreed?,Michael
"Agreed. But that's all, okay.",Pam
"Yeah, discuss these things--",Ryan
"Shut up, shut up. Hello?",Michael
I want my old job back. I want my old parking space back. I want a Sebring.,Michael
They don't make them anymore.,Charles
And I want Charles gone.,Michael
I am not firing Charles. He is very valuable.,David
"That's very kind of you to say, David.",Charles
I need him gone.,Michael
No.,David
"Okay, then I want Pam back.",Michael
"Uh, you already have a new receptionist--",David
Sales.,Michael
Thank you.,Pam
Pam's not a salesperson.,David
"Yes, she is. At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday.",Michael
That's right.,Pam
Okay. Please continue.,David
And Ryan.,Michael
"Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael. Ryan is--",David
"You know, David. I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.",Michael
Do you realize what you're asking for here? You're talking about salary plus health benefits--,David
And dental this time.,Michael
"Insurance, taxes, social security for three people. This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand. You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.",David
These are our demands.,Michael
Your company cannot be worth that much.,David
"Our company is worth nothing. That's the difference between you and I. Business isn't about money to me, David. If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company. And then another and another and another. I have no shortage of company names.",Michael
Michael--,David
That's one of 'em! Yes. These are our demands. This is what we want. Our balls are in your court.,Michael
Okay. Deal. Okay?,David
Can we have the room please?,Michael
"Yeah. [David and Charles leave room, Michael shuts the door and closes the blinds]",David
"Yes, yes, yes!",Ryan
Alright!,Pam
Yes! Can you believe it? That's what I'm talking about!,Michael
There are certain defining moments in a person's life. The day he is born. The day he grows hair. The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin. What have I learned from all of this? It is far too early to tell. I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it. I just want to enjoy it.,Michael
"Hey, guys--",Charles
"No, no. You're done.",Michael
"At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili. The trick is to undercook the onions. Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot. I'm serious about this stuff. I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes. I toast my own Ancho chilies. It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations. It's probably the thing I do best.",Kevin
"Someone is returning! He started his own company, and now he's back. Who could it be? I'll give you a hint. He is a man. A man you have missed with all your heart. A man who has ruined all other men for you. Who is it?",Michael
[whispering] Who is it?,Ryan
[whispering] Who is it?,Pam
"[whispering] It's Michael Scott. [applause; Michael jumps through sign] Hold it up. Conference room, five minutes.",Michael
"Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan. [scattered applause] And how about casual Friday again, huh? Reinstituting casual Friday? You all look great. What I want to do right now is try something a little different. I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting. I want you guys to run it. I want you to say whatever you want, take it away. Your meeting.",Michael
[after a few moments of silence] Wh--what are you doing?,Dwight
"If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.",Michael
Okay.,Angela
Yes.,Michael
People are dressed inappropriately.,Angela
"Take it up with Toby. What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward. And I want you to reflect. And I want you to say something different.",Michael
Can you give us a hint?,Jim
"When I needed salespeople for my new paper company, everyone here turned their back on me. Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness? No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No. Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No. I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.",Michael
"Oscar, what were you going to say?",Michael
Nothing. I didn't say anything.,Oscar
All right.,Michael
Do I still have a job here?,Erin
"Not important. [everyone mutters] Okay, alright. Yes. Yes, you have a job. Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.",Michael
"Wait, what?",Dwight
How is that going to work?,Stanley
"It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--",Michael
You mean the clients you stole from us.,Phyllis
"Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?",Dwight
"No, you lost those clients.",Michael
"I call foul, sir.",Andy
Okay.,Michael
You were bought out. So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.,Dwight
"Okay, Dwight. Let me explain something to you. I set the rules and you follow them. Blindly. Okay? And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department. It's a trash can.",Michael
"[to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid.",Meredith
[laughs] Boscov's at the Steamtown Mall?,Pam
It sure looked good on the mannequin.,Phyllis
"Well, you have good taste.",Pam
"Well, thanks. I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.",Phyllis
What?,Pam
Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them? That I didn't have enough time for them?,Phyllis
"Oh, I, um...",Pam
"Close your mouth, sweetie. You look like a trout.",Phyllis
The man is wearing sandals. I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work. Gross! I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.,Angela
Can't you just not look at his feet?,Toby
"Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby? So trained to deal with a hysterical woman. I don't want to look at his feet. [storms off] Do your job!",Angela
"Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy. Followed her to Scranton. Took the first job I could find in H.R. Later she divorced me. So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R.",Toby
"[hands Ryan a soda] There you are, my friend.",Michael
"Oh, thanks, man.",Ryan
Pamela.,Michael
"Thank, Michael.",Pam
Yep.,Michael
Fresh hot ink.,Dwight
New File System'.,Stanley
"Trust me, Stanley, you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.",Dwight
I am not changing the way I do my files.,Stanley
"No, no. This goes for all of you. Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.",Dwight
When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately. Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink. Urine. It was urine.,Dwight
"I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.",Oscar
I could loan you a pair of socks.,Toby
No.,Oscar
"No, they're clean. I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.",Toby
I don't think so.,Oscar
Andrew Bernard.,Andy
"Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?",Dwight
What are you still doing not at your desk?,Andy
Did you even read the memo?,Dwight
All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--,Andy
"No, you idiot. There is a code embedded in the memo. Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.",Dwight
"Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.",Andy
"Stop doing rhyming poetry. Just tell them, please. God, the simplest thing.",Dwight
"We're in crisis mode here, do you understand? The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together. And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.",Dwight
Can I address that?,Jim
"No, you're too close.",Dwight
Okay.,Jim
"Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?",Dwight
It's not right. I don't like it.,Stanley
He doesn't like it.,Dwight
"You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary. [sighs] No offense, Jim. I think she's very pretty.",Phyllis
"Her face is okay, but-- Jesus! What --what are you doing here?",Dwight
I don't know. I saw a crowd. I thought there might be a dogfight or something--,Meredith
Get out! We need to do something. I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.,Dwight
Those sound too harsh.,Phyllis
"No, I'm not saying we do those things. I'm saying something like those things.",Dwight
Of course. What is like a hostage?,Jim
Excellent question.,Dwight
We could write a strong-worded letter.,Andy
Words will never be enough.,Dwight
Strongly-painted picture.,Jim
"No, pictures are too interpretive.",Dwight
"Can I just say something? I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.",Jim
"Oh. Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim. Oh, I totally see your point. Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly. So uh, meeting is over, I guess. I'll see everyone upstairs.",Dwight
Great. See you upstairs.,Jim
"C'mon. [whispers] Guys. Psst, listen. Now is the time for action. I'm talking action--",Dwight
That one's great.,Pam
I know.,Michael
You look so classy in that picture.,Ryan
I do? Well--Where is that bowl?,Michael
"Hey, you have a second?",Jim
Michael Scott Paper Company only.,Michael
"Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.",Jim
"Okay, well---",Michael
Tough.,Ryan
"I will--no, no. I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.",Michael
"This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny forming in the warehouse right now.",Jim
Against who?,Michael
You. Us.,Ryan
What?,Pam
It's gotta be because they all want their clients.,Ryan
"The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott. They are in for a bitter surprise. I am not to be truffled with.",Michael
"Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me. You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.",Michael
Mm-hmmm.,Pam
"That was us, right there.",Michael
We were something else.,Pam
What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.,Ryan
Mm-hmm.,Michael
Chiklis style.,Ryan
"Yeah, the Commish.",Michael
"Yes, but Chiklis Shield style. Not Commish style.",Ryan
"Yeah, yeah. The Shield.",Michael
"It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?",Creed
"I know. Yeah, it's...kinda--",Jim
Sometimes it's best just to say out of it.,Creed
That's true. That's right. Yeah.,Jim
Want to play a game?,Creed
Hey gang. Where you been?,Michael
Lunch.,Dwight
Where'd you eat?,Michael
A restaurant.,Phyllis
"What'd you have, Stanley?",Michael
"I had a salmon salad. With water, no ice. I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it. Her name was Flo, she had black hair.",Andy
I had Mexican food.,Stanley
"So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you? [walks into kitchen] Oh, wow, Stanley. Is that egg salad? Andy brought some salmon.",Michael
That looks great.,Ryan
"Dwight, is that a meat sandwich? You guys hungry?",Michael
I can eat.,Ryan
I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.,Michael
It's pony.,Dwight
Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?,Michael
Dijonnaise.,Andy
"Mmm. Thanks for going out, guys.",Michael
Mmm.,Pam
"Hey, Meredith. Can I talk to you privately for a second?",Toby
About what?,Meredith
Your outfit.,Toby
What? What's wrong with my outfit?,Meredith
You--you might consider pulling it down a touch. It's ri--it's riding up a little high.,Toby
"A bunch of prudes. You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals, but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes? [pulls down dress, office gasps] Is that how it goes?",Meredith
"Meredith, your boob is out.",Oscar
"Fine. [pulls dress up, everyone gasps again]",Meredith
"Meredith, too far!",Angela
"Dammit, Meredith, where are your panties?",Kelly
"It's casual day. Happy? [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]",Meredith
"[playing chess with Jim] No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that. IF you do this, I'm gonna do that.",Creed
"Well, what if I just do this?",Jim
You don't want to do that.,Creed
I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over. With Creed. Playing chess. At work. He's winning. I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.,Jim
"I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart. Is there anything I can do to make things better?",Ryan
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Give me the phone. Give me the phone.",Dwight
Exactly.,Ryan
That's my client.,Dwight
Exactly. This is your first complaint in ten years.,Ryan
Give me the phone.,Dwight
Things have been generally good.,Ryan
Give me the phone. Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.,Dwight
"Look, uh, Mr. Bart...",Ryan
"Hi, Mr. Bart.",Dwight
At these prices with this service...,Ryan
"Hey, it's Dwight here. Give me the phone.",Dwight
You're not gonna find this anywhere else.,Ryan
"Dwight Schrute here. Hey, don't hang up.",Dwight
"No, no, no. Sir, don't listen.",Ryan
"I know times are tough right now, and I laud your thriftiness. [tries to pull phone out of Ryan's hand] Ryan!",Dwight
"Ryan, hand the phone over.",Phyllis
"Stop flustering me, everybody!",Ryan
Who let this boy on the phone?,Stanley
Ah! Mr. Bart! Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account. He was my client for ten years!,Dwight
"You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time. It's okay, Ryan.",Pam
You're a secretary! What do you know?,Dwight
Okay.,Ryan
And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone. I'm confiscating this.,Dwight
"Hey, hey guys. You know what I want you to do? Shake hands, get over it. That was not a shake, Dwight.",Michael
"We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.",Dwight
Who quits?,Michael
Me.,Phyllis
And me.,Stanley
Me too.,Andy
You guys gotta be kidding.,Michael
"No, we gotta be deadly serious. We'll start our own paper company. The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.",Dwight
"I love it. I love this idea, and I fully support you. As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money. [throws money at Phyllis] There you go. There's some seed money for you. And you can take it, no hard feelings. But if you stay, I want an apology, and I want a big one.",Michael
You want us to apologize to you?,Stanley
Yes I do.,Michael
That's completely backwards.,Andy
It's frontward's.,Michael
"Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt. You should be apologizing to us.",Phyllis
That's right.,Stanley
Right.,Dwight
"Michael, you always said we were a family. Then you went after us.",Phyllis
"No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong. And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways. From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others. And the bottom line, I am in the wrong. I'm the bad guy.",Michael
I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.,Michael
Gasp. Are you talking about a secret meeting?,Dwight
Whatever you guys did earlier.,Michael
I don't know that first things about secret meetings.,Dwight
"Just do it, okay?",Michael
I'll do--,Dwight
Get 'em there. Get 'em there.,Michael
I'll do the best I can.,Dwight
Are you kidding me?,Michael
Deceit does not come easy to me.,Dwight
"Okay, okay, okay.",Michael
I really love your outfit.,Erin
Thank you so much for saying that. I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.,Kelly
You look like J-Lo.,Erin
"So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.",Michael
Are you giving us our clients back?,Stanley
"If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say, 'apology accepted', I think we would all feel better. And then we can break out my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.",Michael
Nobody likes that stuff except for you.,Stanley
They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.,Michael
"Michael, just give us our clients back. That's all we care about.",Phyllis
"Okay. If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.",Michael
So?,Stanley
"Fine, have your clients. I can see that's what you wanted all along. [everyone mutters 'okay'] However, I rescind my apology.",Michael
That's fair.,Dwight
You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.,Michael
What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?,Darryl
"Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.",Ryan
He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now. He'll make his decision by the end of the day.,Pam
I think you should get it. You really grew into it.,Ryan
Oh. I think you should get it. You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it.,Pam
"If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael? That would go a long way coming from you.",Ryan
Yeah.,Pam
Thanks.,Ryan
"So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter.",Creed
"Oh, I'm engaged to Pam.",Jim
I thought you were gay.,Creed
Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?,Jim
I don't know.,Creed
Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?,Michael
Sure. Let me just finish this turn.,Jim
[puts Scrabble pieces on board] And Bingo was his name. Let's go.,Michael
Challenge.,Creed
I need your help. This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.,Michael
"I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan. You know that.",Jim
You're close with Pam too.,Michael
"Eh, she's nice, I guess. You know what? Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.",Jim
"Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.",Michael
"Well, that's--",Jim
I like his hair.,Michael
"Cons, Ryan. He defrauded the company. He has never made a sale.",Jim
Okay.,Michael
He definitely stole my iPod.,Jim
That sounds pretty biased.,Michael
You didn't hear my pros. Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.,Jim
"Okay. Pam, pros.",Michael
Mm-hmm.,Jim
"I like her. I think that she is a fast learner. Cons, she doesn't always follow through. Sh--New York and the whole art school thing. And Roy. She has a weird voice.",Michael
That's not true.,Jim
I don't need to tell you that.,Michael
I think she'd be a really good salesperson.,Jim
"I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.",Michael
And I won't.,Jim
"Okay. So be it, then you've lost credibility. And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.",Michael
"All right. You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill. But that's not a weird voice.",Jim
"Oh, wow! Whoa!",Michael
Take it easy.,Jim
"Ho-ho, man! Wow. [in a high-pitched voice] Honey! I want you to bring the garbage out. 'Cause I'm not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--",Michael
I have a very difficult decision to make. It's like last week I was at the video store. Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice? It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.,Michael
"You don't understand clothing, Toby. You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.",Andy
"All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.",Toby
"Listen up, Flenderson. You're being weak and ineffectual. I'm cowboying this meeting, okay? Here are the new rules. Earth tones only. Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.",Dwight
"All right, come. Sit down, Dwight.",Toby
No.,Dwight
I'm running this meeting.,Toby
That's debatable.,Dwight
It's not. It's not. Sit down or I am writing you up.,Toby
"Ooh, where has this guy been?",Meredith
Casual Fridays are cancelled. [everyone protests] Let's just not do it anymore.,Toby
You're running from the problem.,Andy
"There's not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly.",Toby
"Pam, can you come in here, please? Have a seat. [clears throat] Well, there's no easy way of saying this. So I think I will just...drag it out. Since the dawn of time there has been--",Michael
Just tell me.,Pam
I gave Ryan the sales job. There just weren't enough clients for the two of you. So I had to--,Michael
"No, okay.",Pam
"I'm sorry, sorry.",Michael
"Okay, I get it. [Michael laughs] Why are you giggling? Is this a joke? [Michael continues to laugh] Michael, is this-- did I get the job?",Pam
"[laughing] Yes, you did.",Michael
I did?,Pam
Yep.,Michael
"For real, you're not kidding?",Pam
"No, you--no.",Michael
I did?,Pam
"No, you're the best person for the job. You're going to be great.",Michael
"Oh, Michael, thank you. Thank you.",Pam
"[laughing] Oh, oh!",Michael
Thank you. You will not be sorry.,Pam
"You should have seen your face. Oh man! Oh, that was classic.",Michael
Oh. [laughing] I really thought I didn't get it.,Pam
"Oh, really?",Michael
Yeah. 'Cause you said I didn't,Pam
"Oh, man. That was really good. That was really good.",Michael
What about Ryan?,Pam
"I don't know, I offered him his temp job back. We'll see. He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--",Michael
Yeah. Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.,Pam
"I don't appreciate you telling me what to do. So clean out your desk, you are through here.",Michael
"Thanks, Michael.",Pam
Oh! What's our receptionists name?,Michael
Erin.,Pam
Could you send her in?,Michael
[opens door] Erin. Michael wants to see you.,Pam
Hello.,Michael
Hi.,Erin
Have a seat.,Michael
"This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go. [pick up phone] Hank, could you come up here please? Hank is our security guard--",Michael
"Oh, I can go.",Erin
He will be ushering you out. [starts laughing],Michael
Oh!,Erin
"Oh, your face! Oh!",Michael
Is--do the people--,Erin
"No, I'm kidding. No, you're not--you're not fired. Yet.",Michael
Oh!,Erin
Oh...,Michael
"Do they not like me, though?",Erin
"I don't know, actually.",Michael
Okay.,Erin
"Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest! [Erin screams, Pam and Jim look at each other, Dwight, laughing, gets up and hands her some money]",Erin
[whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.,Erin
Shut up.,Dwight
[laughs hysterically] I got her!,Dwight
"Not cool, Dwight. [Dwight continues laughing]",Pam
Not cool. [Dwight still laughing],Jim
"[caught by camera crew dancing to 'At the Car Wash', but laughing] Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.",Michael
"Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?",Michael
I do.,Dwight
Okay. How about a woman? Pam?,Michael
"Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.",Pam
"Oh, really? Ok.",Michael
Just sent it.,Pam
What about the rest of you? [complete silence],Michael
"At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.",Michael
Who else? Who else? Ryan?,Michael
I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.,Ryan
"Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.",Ryan
Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.,Michael
No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.,Angela
"Michael, we have a lot of work to do.",Phyllis
What?,Michael
Work.,Phyllis
Ugh! God! What happened to you people? [talking like a robot] We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.,Michael
"If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.",Pam
"Oh, no. Your battery fell out.",Pam
[still talking like a robot] I... was just learning... to... love.,Michael
"Hi, guys. How you doing?",Erin
"Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.",Dwight
Right. I'm sorry.,Erin
"[sighs] Now, how can I help you?",Dwight
"Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?",Erin
"Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -",Dwight
So someone is going to a court. Big deal.,Pam
"It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.",Dwight
Sure.,Erin
There are other reasons to go to Ohio.,Jim
We're getting married today.,Pam
"So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.",Jim
Tell 'em how it happened.,Pam
"Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.",Jim
And very expensive.,Pam
Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -,Jim
You can't leave anyone out.,Pam
No one.,Jim
"Ok, just get to the good part.",Pam
"Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ' You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.'",Jim
I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.,Pam
Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?,Erin
No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.,Michael
"Well, I like to swim.",Erin
That's good.,Michael
You have a cool place to come hang.,Erin
"If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so...",Michael
Thanks.,Erin
"Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.",Michael
Wow.,Erin
Now you got it.,Michael
Now I do got it.,Erin
"Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?",Michael
"Oh, yeah.",Erin
You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.,Michael
That's rule #1.,Erin
Ok. I love it. I love it.,Michael
Whew.,Erin
I love it.,Michael
"Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.",Michael
"Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like [pause] Dave died or something.",Michael
Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.,Michael
Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.,Oscar
I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.,Michael
[baby voice] Wittle Andy is afwaid.,Andy
Andy's afwaid?,Michael
Yes.,Andy
Are you all afwaid?,Michael
No.,Dwight
Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.,Michael
What?,Pam
Funk is the problem and the solution.,Michael
That makes sense.,Jim
I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.,Michael
Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?,Oscar
"Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.",Michael
[Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.,Dwight
This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?,Meredith
"No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco.",Michael
It's like a haunted disco.,Andy
... with coffee but without the haunted.,Michael
It's a combo dance house coffee bar.,Phyllis
It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.,Michael
It's a cafe disco.,Erin
Exactly.,Michael
"So, like, a disco cafe?",Kevin
Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.,Michael
"Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.",Michael
Yeah.,Kevin
Holdin' down the fort.,Michael
Yeah. This place is great.,Kevin
Thank you.,Michael
"Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.",Angela
I'm sorry.,Kevin
This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.,Michael
Yeah. Respect the lei.,Kevin
Come.,Angela
"Kevin, stay.",Michael
"Kevin, come.",Angela
"Kevin, stay.",Michael
"Kevin, come.",Angela
"Stay, stay.",Michael
"Come on, right now.",Angela
"Cookie. Kevin, cookie.",Michael
"Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin.",Angela
[to Michael] Is there a cookie?,Kevin
Mmm-hmm.,Michael
Wha -,Angela
Come on.,Michael
"Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come.",Angela
I wanted a cookie.,Kevin
Completely unacceptable.,Angela
"Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you're just some terrible monster.",Michael
"[Michael is holding the stereo speaker up to a vent - blaring '[Gonna Make You Sweat] Everybody Dance Now', spins in chair] Oww!",Andy
"Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?",Phyllis
"Oh, he's on a call.",Jessica
"Oh, I'll just duck my head in.",Phyllis
It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?,Jessica
Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.,Phyllis
I'll let him know.,Jessica
Mmm-hmm.,Phyllis
Phyllis?,Michael
Hi.,Phyllis
Hey!,Michael
Hey. I like.,Phyllis
[starts dancing with Phyllis] Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.,Michael
Oh! Mother ******!,Phyllis
"Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!",Michael
Back!,Phyllis
"Oh, wow! What did you do?",Michael
[moans in pain],Phyllis
You didn't do that. You're ok. You're ok. Let's lie down. You want to go down? Alright.,Michael
Wow! Sorry!,Phyllis
"Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie.",Michael
"Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?",Dwight
No. No. No.,Michael
Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?,Dwight
It's my back.,Phyllis
It's her back. We just - We need - Let's - You know what?,Michael
Call a doctor.,Phyllis
We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on.,Michael
No. Call Bob.,Phyllis
"Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.",Michael
Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.,Dwight
I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?,Michael
What do you think history is?,Dwight
"It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.",Michael
[barging through office door] Alright. Here we go.,Michael
Out of the way! Move it or lose it!,Dwight
You having fun?,Michael
"Oh, my God! What happened?",Erin
"What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you.",Michael
What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.,Phyllis
You want to get sick you go to the hospital.,Dwight
"Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.",Michael
What happened to Phyllis?,Oscar
"Oh, you know. Nohting. She's - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So...",Michael
Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?,Angela
Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything. [Phyllis can be heard screaming in the backgroud],Michael
I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.,Stanley
You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?,Michael
Yes.,Erin
I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.,Michael
Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.,Erin
I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.,Michael
[exits the conference room in an undershirt] I'm gonna need two able bodied men.,Dwight
Cafe Disco? More like Crappe Disco.,Kelly
You're bad. [they turn off the lights and turn on music - start dancing],Erin
There's girl in there.,Vance Refrigeration Guy 1
Where?,Vance Refrigeration Guy 2
The other room?,VRG 1
What other room?,VRG 2
Down the hall.,VRG 1
There's girls in there?,VRG 2
What'd I just say?,VRG 1
You have another sandwich?,VRG 2
Forget the sandwich. Girls. Girls.,VRG 1
I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.,Michael
"You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?",Dwight
Dwight! Dwight!,Phyllis
"Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?",Dwight
I do.,Phyllis
No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. [mimics grinding teeth] It's like children singing Christmas carols.,Dwight
Yeah! I love the vibe down here.,Andy
Ashley! You made it!,Erin
You invited someone?,Oscar
"Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?",Erin
I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude.,Oscar
"I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm in a dance off. Alright!",Andy
Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.,Michael
"I hear it, too, Boss.",Creed
It's better than I imagined it!,Michael
"That feels good, Dwight.",Phyllis
Tell me where it hurts.,Dwight
Right... mmmm... right there.,Phylis
Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.,Dwight
"Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott.",Michael
"Hey, Angela! Welcome to -",Erin
Stop!,Angela
Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?,Michael
No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.,Angela
Oh. Alright. There you go.,Michael
No. You need to sign them all.,Angela
No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.,Michael
"Look, I hate to be 'that' person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.",Angela
"I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, ' This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you.' [Angela shows Michael the papers again] No.",Michael
"This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.",Dwight
An hour? I can't stay here an hour.,Phyllis
"Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.",Dwight
"Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.",Creed
"Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place.",Michael
No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.,Creed
I'm gonna with the python.,Dwight
But the rattler's so scary.,Phyllis
No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.,Dwight
I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle],Phyllis
What's so funny?,Dwight
When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh],Phyllis
"Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!",Michael
You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?,Angela
No... cleaning... up.,Michael
"[waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.",Jim
They're beautiful.,Pam
You ready?,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.,Jim
Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It's really happening.,Michael
"Wanna dance, Dwight?",Phyllis
"Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.",Dwight
Mind if I steal my wife?,Bob Vance
You can't steal what is legally your property.,Dwight
Are those staples?,Bob Vance
This dance competition is not over.,Andy
"What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.",Kelly
You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.,Michael
We're gonna stay.,Jim
Really?,Michael
Yeah. At least for one more dance.,Jim
"Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco! [Dwight hits Michael in ear] Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to 'Y'.",Michael
This is so cheesy.,Pam
Yes.,Jim
I like cheesy.,Pam
"Me, too.",Jim
Yeah. I think maybe I want a 'wedding' wedding.,Pam
"Me, too.",Jim
Really?,Pam
Yeah.,Jim
Would you like to dance?,Michael
No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music],Angela
"Yeah. No. Well, ok.",Andy
Stop squirming.,Kelly
"Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing.",Andy
You wanted to do this. Just be brave.,Kelly
"I, I - but you're not a professional and I'm thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional.",Andy
I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.,Kelly
Are you sure that's not the 'gay' ear?,Andy
Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?,Kelly
"Well, I...",Andy
"Look, I'm gonna count to 3.",Kelly
Count to twen - count to twenty.,Andy
No. I'm gonna count to 3.,Kelly
K,Andy
1... 2... 3,Kelly
Agh! Son of a bitch!,Andy
"Andy, that was just the ice.",Kelly
It was?,Andy
Yeah. It was.,Kelly
"Hey, Kevin.",Lynn
Hi. Did you have bacon for breakfast?,Kevin
No.,Lynn
Oh...cause you smell like bacon.,Kevin
I didn't think I did. How's everything going?,Lynn
Tight. I'm going down the hall to this office to see Michael - there's free espressos.,Kevin
Oh.,Lynn
I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.,Kevin
We can still...,Lynn
Are you sure that you didn't eat bacon?,Kevin
Yes.,Lynn
Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.,Kevin
"Yes, I had some bacon this morning. I just didn't think it was anyone's business.",Lynn
I love the smell of bacon on a woman.,Kevin
"Hey, Lynn, it's Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.",Kevin
"Just go down, Kevin.",Oscar
My grandpa was the funnest guy I ever knew. He would sing. He would dance. He would....fall down. But then...he started going to these meetings and everything changed. He...stopped going out at night. He got a job. The fun just dried up. It was really sad. I don't want that to happen to you guys. I'm not gonna let it happen.,Michael
How did I end up back in Crazytown?,Stanley
It is hard to imagine you playing softball.,Dwight
I was all-county my junior and senior years.,Phyllis
Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.,Dwight
The girls school?,Phyllis
I played high school softball. Notice I didn't say 'girls' high school softball. Not after the landmark case of Shrute vs. the Lackawanna County Board of Education.That was one case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court got right. I hit the ball right over the protest banners.,Dwight
"[sarcastically] Oh, no. I love Ohio. Next time you're there say 'Hi' to my cousin Amel and then kick him in the groin area because he's a cheat and a ball hog. And if he's still married to Clarissa, kick her in the groin area, too. 'Cause she's a heart breaking tart...and a ball hog.",Dwight
"[phone rings, whispering] Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.",Erin
"Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.",Jim
"[whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?",Jim
[whispering] I can do it.,Pam
[whispering] What do you need from me?,Dwight
"Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. [laughs heartily] No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.",Dwight
[mumbles in his sleep as Pam and Jim change the clocks in his office],Michael
[changing the clock in Michael's car] Like clockwork.,Dwight
"[silently counting] Three, two, one... [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly]",Jim
"[wakes up, joins in with the laughter] Uh oh. What's so funny?",Michael
You had to be there.,Pam
"Oh yay! Geography joke. [still laughing, notices the time] Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.",Michael
See you later!,Michael
"Bye Michael! [all applaud and cheer, Dwight imitates gunfire] Yeah!",Dwight
"[at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?",Jim
"Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?",Pam
Yeah.,Jim
Okay.,Pam
"Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]",Jim
"Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.",Pam
"Come on, who doesn't like a picnic?",Jim
Tell them what happened last year.,Pam
I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.,Jim
"No, no, that guy who hit on me.",Pam
"Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.",Jim
"Yeah, you don't grab these [gestures to her chest] for balance.",Pam
Well...,Jim
I'm gonna say 30.,Dwight
"Ah, 40. Insect repellent, which we clearly need, reduces the effectiveness of SPF.",Rolph
"Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.",Dwight
Woah. Homemade?,Rolph
Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh],Dwight
Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.,Dwight
"Michael, isn't that Holly?",Kevin
"We're just friends. [approaches Holly and AJ] Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.",Michael
"Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.",Holly
"Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right.",Michael
All right.,Holly
All right. Mmhmm. [both start laughing and hug] Hey.,Michael
"Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?",Holly
"A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.",Michael
Hey Michael.,AJ
Hey. [hugs AJ a little too forcefully] Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.,Michael
Lemonade sounds great.,Holly
Okay.,Michael
"I'd love an iced tea, actually.",AJ
"You can go to hell. [laughs] I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.",Michael
"I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one: 'Holly, you and I are soup snakes.' The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.",Michael
Jim. Pam.,Charles
"Hey, how are you?",Jim
Hey Charles.,Pam
"Nice day, huh?",Charles
Yeah.,Jim
Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest. [walks away],Charles
I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.,Jim
Do you want me to beat him up for you?,Pam
"No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.",Jim
Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?,Dwight
"Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.",Jim
"Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!",Dwight
"Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?",Andy
Why? I don't understand.,Dwight
If-,Andy
"Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.",Dwight
Uh... [laughs sheepishly],Andy
"I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.",Dwight
That's...,Andy
Sly dog.,Dwight
... not what I meant.,Andy
"Come on, folks!",Dwight
"What is up with you two, Holly?",Michael
"Um, not much.",Holly
We're designing a house.,AJ
Cool. For who?,Michael
For us.,AJ
"Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported.",Michael
I remember your chair pants idea. [laughs],Holly
I like that. Put me down for a pair. I'm a size 34 waist.,AJ
"All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.",Michael
"Okay, yeah.",Holly
You guys are really gonna do this?,AJ
You bet your fat ass we are.,Michael
"Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.",Michael
"Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.",Holly
That's right.,Michael
[in a New York accent] Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!,Holly
Newspapers for sale!,Michael
"[playing volleyball, yelling at Erin, who hit the ball out of bounds] Are you blind?! Are you blind?! [turns attention to a man on the other team] Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? I'm concerned you might be in danger.",Andy
"These are expensive Ray-Bans, jackass.",Man
"Okay, I was just looking out for you. [to Erin] You're doing great, by the way.",Andy
Thanks.,Erin
[playing volleyball] I got it. [Kevin misses],Kevin
"Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!",Dwight
Are you blind?!,Andy
"I could've gotten that, idiot!",Dwight
Can you see things with your eyeballs?!,Andy
"It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!",Dwight
We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.,Phyllis
[grunts in frustration],Dwight
"[playing volleyball, Ryan hits the ball away, not paying attention to the game] Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net.",Dwight
So what?,Woman
"Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?",Dwight
"Back off, Dwight. [serves] Hyuh! [the opposing team misses the ball, the Scranton team cheers] What?",Pam
Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.,Pam
"[serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win!",Pam
"Nice job, Beesly.",Jim
Yes! We advance to the next round!,Dwight
"Oh, Lord in heaven.",Phyllis
[to Phyllis] Had to be part of the group. [laughs],Stanley
"I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.",Michael
"Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?",Holly
[watching her eat] What?,Michael
"Do you have a script for the sketch, or...",Holly
"Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?",Michael
Crystal cool.,Holly
[playing volleyball] Hit it Andy!,Dwight
Bump! I bumped it!,Andy
Set!,Kevin
Don't set it to yourself!,Dwight
[Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!,Kevin
"Ow, my ankle!",Phyllis
What happened?,Dwight
I... twisted it.,Phyllis
"You weren't even moving. [Phyllis leaves the court] Okay, sub!",Dwight
I can play.,Angela
Is there a... Meredith here?,Rolph
Yeah! Man in!,Meredith
"Rolph, did you not hear me?",Angela
"I don't hear cheaters, tramps, or women who break my friend's heart. Let's go!",Rolph
We could do a movie... sort of thing.,Michael
[gasps] We could do Back to the Future.,Holly
Oh!,Michael
We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents. [both laugh],Holly
Could we get a Delorean?,Michael
Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.,Holly
Oh! [to the theme of 'Jaws'] Dun-der. Dun-der...,Michael
Dun-der. Dun-der...,Holly
Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!! [both laugh],Michael
Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.,Holly
No. No.,Michael
Oh.,Holly
We're circling it.,Michael
Hmm...,Holly
"[playing volleyball, Scranton wins another game] Nicely done. We're still going to crush you though!",David
Yes we are!,Charles
You suckers are goin down! They're gonna wipe their asses with your serves! Piss all over your faces!,Rolph
"Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait- [shouts of disapproval]",Dwight
It's true!,Rolph
"Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall.",Toby
"Oh yeah, with Bernie and Efrem. That was hilarious.",Kendall
"Really, really funny.",Toby
Really funny.,Kendall
"Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. [they get the last point, Jim and Dwight hug]",Dwight
Settle down gentlemen.,Oscar
Good game!,Pam
"Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.",David
"[shouts from behind the trees] Uh, it's a sketch now.",Michael
"Okay, introducing Scranton's Michael Scott performing with Nashua's Holly Flax! I have not seen this. [applause]",David
"And now, presenting...",Michael
SlumDunder Mifflinaire! [laughter],Both
[imitates Who Wants To Be a Millionaire theme music as both sit in folding chairs],Michael
Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?,Holly
"Yes, I am.",Michael
"For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?",Holly
"Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.",Michael
"That is correct! [both run to another side of the stage, acting out a different scene] How did you know that?! [pantomimes electrocuting Michael]",Holly
[screams] Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!,Michael
[now pretending to be Dunder and Mifflin] Nice campus. Think you'll get in?,Holly
"Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in.",Michael
I'm Robert Dunder.,Holly
"I'm Robert Mifflin. [pause to see audience's response] Ah, okay. [both run back to chairs]",Michael
"Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!",Holly
"Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.",Michael
That is correct!,Holly
Yes!,Michael
"I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.",Stanley
"The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!",Holly
"I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!",Michael
That is correct!,Holly
[over crowd of murmurs] What is he talking about?,Man from Buffalo
"[pantomimes biting off Michael's fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!",Holly
David Wallace told me!!,Michael
"David, is this true?",Woman from Buffalo
"Uh, okay everyone, we're at a picnic today...",David
"Are we losing our jobs or not, David?",Man from Buffalo
They didn't know?,Holly
[whispers] I guess not.,Michael
"I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.",David
And?,Woman from Buffalo
We're- we're closing the Buffalo branch.,David
[over shouts of protest] You've got to be kidding me! You've got to be kidding me! We're the best branch in the company! I can't believe it. [Michael and Holly bow],Man from Buffalo
How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?,David
Well... I didn't know they didn't know.,Michael
"What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, 'oh, this would be really funny.'",David
Thank you.,Michael
"Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, 'is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?'",David
"Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts.",Michael
Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.,Meredith
"Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.",Dwight
How do you figure?,Pam
"Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.",Dwight
Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.,Oscar
Let's do this.,Pam
"[playing volleyball] Jim, come on! [Jim scores a point, Scranton cheers]",Andy
"Look who just woke up! [laughs, scores a point on the next play] I've been up for a while.",Charles
It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin],Kevin
"Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?",Angela
Here's an accounting question for you: what does one fiance plus one lover equal? Answer: one whore.,Rolph
"Okay, knock it off, Rolph.",Dwight
"What? She is sitting there, casting aspersions-",Rolph
"Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-",Dwight
No way! You don't mean that!,Rolph
"Rolph, leave it alone!",Dwight
[hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah!,Erin
[running for the ball] I got it!,Pam
Pam!,Dwight
[falls] Oof!,Pam
You all right?,Jim
"Yep. No, no, no, I'm fine.",Pam
You sure?,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
"Hey, easy, easy...",Jim
"Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at.",Charles
"No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second.",Pam
"I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?",Charles
Yeah.,David
"All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.",Jim
"Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health.",Charles
"No, uh-",Jim
"Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go!",Pam
"Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot.",Charles
[whispering] Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.,Dwight
"I guess that's it for you, Jim.",Charles
"All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let's do this.",Jim
We'll be back!,Pam
"Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! [kicks volleyball into the woods, calmly] I'll get it. [walks slowly toward the woods]",Dwight
Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo.,Michael
Hindsight.,Holly
Should've had hindsight.,Michael
How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?,Holly
I think it went well. I think it was good.,Michael
There weren't any laughs.,Holly
"No, it was a tough audience.",Michael
"Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.",Holly
"Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.",Michael
"Well, I'm glad we did it.",Holly
Me too. [long pause] We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.,Michael
I can't wait.,Holly
"[on the phone] Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!",Jim
"To be safe, we should do an x-ray.",Nurse
How long will that take?,Pam
"Oh, shouldn't be too bad, it's a slow day. So, no other radiation this year, no metal plates, no chance you're pregnant...",Nurse
"I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to.",Pam
"Oh good, because my next question was 'do you have a game to get back to.'",Nurse
What'd you think?,Holly
"I loved it. You know, there was a part near the end that seemed like that went on a little long, but...",AJ
Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.,Michael
[laughs] Okay. So good to see you.,Holly
Good to see you. [they hug] AJ.,Michael
Michael. [they shake hands],AJ
"I didn't find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year she'll be with somebody, and the next year, I'll be with somebody, and it's gonna take a long time... And then it's perfect. I'm in no rush.",Michael
"Dwight, come on now, it's time to put in the subs.",David
"Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay?",Charles
Okay. Fine.,Dwight
All right! Come on.,Charles
"Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?",Dwight
Dwight.,Andy
"No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?",Dwight
Dwight.,David
Seven? Can I finish please?,Dwight
Okay.,David
Eight?,Dwight
"[on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]",Jim
"[enters office, somersaults onto couch, kicks over painting and lamp] Parkour!",Michael
"[rush into office, Andy climbs on reception desk, Dwight holds video camera]",Dwight & Andy
Parkour!,Andy
"[walking on Pam's desk, then Jim's desk] Extreme! Parkour!",Dwight
"This... is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.",Jim
"[stands on his hands kicking open bathroom doors as Andy films, Meredith is seen applying deodorant in women's bathroom]",Dwight
"[approaching elevator, as Michael films] Parkour! Parkour!",Dwight & Andy
Andy! Leapfrog! [Andy leapfrogs Dwight],Dwight
Do me! Do me!,Andy
"Yeah! [Dwight jumps on Andy's back, riding him like a horse] Parkour! Parkour!",Dwight
Ow! Get off! Get off!,Andy
Okay.,Dwight
"[walking across cars in parking lot, Dwight filming] Parkour! Parkour!",Andy & Michael
"[crouching beside car] Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera! [Michael feebly attempts to jump off car, gives double thumbs up to camera]",Dwight
"[standing on tractor trailer with Dwight and Andy, looking down] Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.",Michael
"Here it is, here it is... truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster, [camera pans to refrigerator boxes, then dumpster] 360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can.",Andy
[in unison] Yeah! Gainer! Woohoo!,Michael & Dwight
[to Michael's camera] Hardcore Parkour!,Andy
Parkoooooour!,Michael
Let's do it!,Dwight
"[leaps from trailer, disappears into empty refrigerator box]",Andy
"[look down, appearing shocked and concerned]",Michael & Dwight
"[inside refrigerator box, sounding injured] Parkour!",Andy
[on telephone] Good. Excellent. Thank you.,Dwight
[hands Dwight a cup of water] There you go. Is there anything else I can do?,Female Intern
"[chugs water, throws away cup] Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?",Dwight
[nods] Mm hmm.,Female Intern
Go put them all in random order.,Dwight
[confused] Mm-kay.,Female intern
Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.,Dwight
"This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns for a while, ever since Michael's Monica Lewinsky incident. [interns are shown gathered around Kelly's desk, one holding a box of tissues, as Kelly cries and wipes tears] He didn't do anything sexual. [female intern opens a jar of salsa for Michael] He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes. [Meredith rubs her breasts into Maurie's back] It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program.",Pam
"[to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him?",Meredith
"I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.",Oscar
"If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself.",Kelly
[entering break room] Who's getting married?,Michael
Nobody.,Pam
"If somebody doesn't tell me, I'm gonna start screaming.",Michael
It's Eric and Megan.,Kelly
"Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly.",Michael
They're not getting married. It's just talk.,Phyllis
Did everybody know about this but me?,Michael
"There's nothing to know, it's just gossip.",Phyllis
[shaking head disgustedly] Okay... okay. [leaves room],Michael
[talking head with Jim] We haven't told anyone I'm pregnant.,Pam
"Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.",Jim
"Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum.",Pam
"Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun?",Jim
Nope.,Pam
No shotgun... 'cause that changes everything.,Jim
"Can't back out now, Halpert.",Pam
"What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!",Jim
"No, keep it up.",Pam
[approaches Dwight's desk] You'll never guess what I know.,Michael
"[typing] Okay, let me finish this thought.",Dwight
Eric likes Megan.,Michael
[still typing] He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.,Dwight
[annoyed] How do you know this?,Michael
"[still typing] People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. [finishes typing, turns to face Michael] Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?",Dwight
"I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball?",Michael
"[to Maurie, the Asian intern] Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said 'The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle.'",Michael
What are you talking about?,Maurie
I'm talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.,Michael
At Tink's?,Maurie
Yes,Michael
How'd you know about that?,Maurie
Well...,Michael
Did Stanley tell you?,Maurie
[confused] Stanley was on your group date?,Michael
"No, Stanley was with his wife. I waved at him, but he didn't wave back.",Maurie
[laughs] Does anybody else know about this?,Michael
No.,Maurie
"[laughs, looks to camera excitedly]",Michael
"There he goes. There he goes. [Stanley gets up from his desk, walks into kitchen area]",Michael
"So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?",Michael
[stare blankly at Michael],"Dwight, Jim & Pam"
Nothing? Well I got a little somethin' somethin'. I don't know if I should say...,Michael
Just keep it to yourself then.,Pam
Stanly is having a midlife crisis.,Michael
Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.,Dwight
"Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.",Michael
"Teri's out of town, Michael.",Phyllis
Who?,Michael
"Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.",Phyllis
"[starts to speak, says nothing, walks away]",Michael
"[entering break room, to Maurie] You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.",Michael
What are you talking about?,Maurie
Stanley's wife is out of town.,Michael
He was with somebody.,Maurie
He was definitely with somebody.,Eric
"Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?",Michael
[chuckles],Eric
[upset] I don't get it!,Michael
"If that was his sister, then what they were doing was totally illegal.",Eric
Drugs?,Michael
Making out.,Eric
[fumbling for words] Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on.,Michael
"[approaching Kelly's desk, whispering] Stanley is having an affir.",Michael
WHAT??,Kelly
"I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say, [Michael is seen whispering to Jim, then Pam] that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention.",Michael
"[motioning to pad of paper with hangman game, spelling out 'S_an_ey is chea_in_ _n _eri] That and that are the same letter.",Michael
Q.,Kevin
"No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed?",Michael
T.,Kevin
"T! Yes! Yes! That is a 'T', and there's another one right there. Just sound that out. You're almost there.",Michael
"[opening blinds as Stanley walks past] Hey, Stanley! Where you goin', big guy? Up to no good?",Michael
I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?,Stanley
"No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?",Michael
Goodbye. [walks away],Stanley
Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.,Michael
[approaching Michael] You have to stop this.,Jim
"[giddy, whispering] Did you hear Stanley's having an affair?",Michael
I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.,Jim
"Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser...",Michael
Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.,Jim
"[stares at Jim silently, then walks away]",Michael
"[in parking lot, blocking path of Stanley's car] Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real. [Stanley honks horn repeatedly] Stanley, are you having an affair?",Michael
"[as Michael gets in car] That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?",Stanley
"So It's not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip.",Michael
[hits steering wheel angrily] Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.,Stanley
[nodding] So stupid!,Michael
It's just that... Teri's been traveling a lot...,Stanley
"I know, I know.",Michael
And it's been lonely.,Stanley
"Oh, I bet.",Michael
"Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't...",Stanley
"Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true?",Michael
"Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear.",Stanley
"Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool.",Michael
"I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.",Stanley
[muttering] I'm not saying... a damn thing.,Michael
"I'm counting on you, Michael.",Stanley
[looking afraid] You can count on me.,Michael
[sighs],Stanley
"[entering kitchen area] Oh, that smells good.",Michael
"I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.",Kevin
Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird.,Michael
Yeah... what do you mean exactly?,Kevin
"Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike.",Michael
Reeeeally.,Kevin
Uh huh. [gestures to Kevin to keep it quiet] Alright?,Michael
"How do you un-tell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, including 'Stanley is having an affair.' It's like the end of Spartacus. I've seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.",Michael
Kelly has an eating disorder?,Erin
Yeah.,Michael
She always eats my lunch.,Erin
Anorexia. She's an anorexatic.,Michael
We should do something.,Erin
"Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.",Michael
"[to Kelly] I'm worried about Erin, because she's not a very good worker. I don't know how long she's gonna last here.",Michael
Really?,Kelly
Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.,Michael
Andy Bernard??,Kelly
Mm hmm.,Michael
[whispering to Meredith] Did you hear Pam is pregnant?,Michael
Really?,Meredith
Yeah!,Michael
She's gonna hate being a mom.,Meredith
[making a cup of tea in kitchen area],Andy
[looks at Andy and giggles],Kevin
What?,Andy
[still giggling] Tea.,Kevin
So?,Andy
You would.,Kevin
[laughing] I like tea!,Andy
"[sarcastically] Oh, I bet you like it.",Kevin
Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea!,Andy
Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?,Kevin
WHAT??,Andy
Because you're gay.,Kevin
[serious] Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?,Andy
"This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird. [chuckles nervously] Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course. [long pause] But it makes you wonder.",Andy
[to Oscar in break room] Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay?,Andy
[nodding] I did. Yes.,Oscar
And?,Andy
What?,Oscar
Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay?,Andy
Are you attracted to other men?,Oscar
"[scoffs and chuckles] No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, [long pause] I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like.",Andy
[stares at Andy incredulously],Oscar
"Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive?",Andy
"If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?",Oscar
"It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario.",Andy
Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.,Oscar
What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.,Oscar
How far along is Pam?,Phyllis
"A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding.",Meredith
"[whispering] Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go.",Michael
"[with everyone assembled in conference room] Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.",Michael
"[giving envelopes to interns] Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.",Dwight
Why would we call you at night?,Eric
"[grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.",Dwight
[to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.,Jim
"Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. [interns do nothing] One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you [looks directly at Megan] will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.",Dwight
[eating cake with Kelly] I am so happy you're eating again.,Erin
[mouth full of cake] Me too!,Kelly
"[to Jim] Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?",Andy
"Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.",Jim
Women friends?,Andy
Yep.,Jim
Not guy friends?,Andy
Are you... interested in her guy friends?,Jim
"No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women.",Andy
Okay.,Jim
"But off the record, I'm kinda confused.",Andy
Really.,Jim
"Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like...",Andy
Well you gotta figure this out.,Jim
"Yeah, right?",Andy
Yeah!,Jim
How?,Andy
You gotta have sex with a woman.,Jim
Right-o.,Andy
And a man.,Jim
Ohh...,Andy
And then compare.,Jim
Alright. [looks around uneasily] Well hey...,Andy
Yep.,Jim
Congratulations to you.,Andy
On what?,Jim
[chuckles] Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.,Andy
[looks around room nervously],Jim
[to Pam] Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard?,Angela
What?,Pam
Want me to say it again?,Angela
Why did that come into your brain?,Pam
[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?,Jim
"[whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know.",Jim
Who did you tell?,Pam
I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?,Jim
Nobody!,Pam
"[approaching Jim and Pam] Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma? Because I don't, and if it gets out, they won't let me scuba.",Creed
"If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward?",Creed
[to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?,Oscar
[to Phyllis and Stanley] What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin?,Toby
"Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?",Jim
[in unison] Yes.,Everyone
"[entering conference room] Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors.",Michael
"Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?",Jim
"That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap.",Michael
"Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.",Pam
"I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?",Kevin
I heard that from... Andy.,Creed
I heard it from Erin.,Andy
I heard it from Michael.,Erin
[quietly leaves room],Michael
[approaching Michael at elevators] Michael? [to others] He's over here!,Pam
[to Michael] Where are you going?,Pam
Nowhere.,Michael
"Michael... [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]",Dwight
Don't get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator],Pam
"Michael, don't.",Jim
Don't... get... on. Do not.,Pam
Michael...,Jim
Stay.,Kevin
Step away.,Pam
"Come on, boss.",Creed
[reluctantly exits elevator],Michael
"[to everyone, in conference room] Okay, I made it all up.",Michael
[sighs in unison],Everyone
Even the fact that I'm gay?,Andy
Yes.,Michael
[relieved] Yes!,Andy
"But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model.",Michael
No. We heard that about Jim.,Angela
"Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.",Michael
How is that a bad rumor?,Angela
"Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit.",Michael
"Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...",Oscar
[pissed off] You told everyone I was having an affair?,Stanley
"Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.",Michael
"Well then, what's the one true rumor?",Kelly
We have a right to know.,Phyllis
Michael... am I gay?,Andy
"[sighs] The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that...",Michael
[interrupting] That Pam's pregnant.,Jim
I knew it!,Angela
"I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought 'Oh, she has a new bra with padding.' But then I thought 'Pam doesn't need padding.' It just didn't add up, Jim.",Kevin
Okay. Thank you.,Jim
Congratulations!,Phyllis
"That's really great, you guys.",Erin
Don't vaccinate it.,Ryan
Who's the father?,Dwight
Jim.,Pam
How far along?,Creed
Four months.,Jim
Who's the OB/GYN?,Creed
Stop. Don't. Just...,Pam
"Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.",Michael
Nope.,Jim
Yes. Jim...,Michael
"[arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.",Jim
Yes.,Pam
If everyone would like to see proof.,Jim
Okay. [leaves room],Pam
"Are we just gonna wait here? [Pam returns, displays sonogram]",Kelly
"[gasps, then cheers]",Everyone
It's true!,Kelly
Look at that! [grabs sonogram from Pam] That is the inside of your vagina! [Jim takes sonogram from Michael],Michael
"[talking head with Jim] It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now. [Jim nods, looking at floor]",Pam
[to Jim and Pam] How long have you known about the pregnancy?,Michael
[look at each other uncertainly],Jim & Pam
A week? A month? A year?,Michael
"Michael, we only told our parents last week.",Jim
Did you pee on a stick?,Michael
I did. It was inconclusive.,Jim
You should've told me.,Michael
[exchanges looks with Jim] You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.,Pam
"[phone rings, hits speaker button]",Michael
"Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call.",Erin
[gasps],Michael
[in disbelief] You called Stanley's wife?,Pam
"Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God.",Michael
Don't take it.,Jim
"No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious.",Michael
"If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious.",Pam
"No, no, I can do this.",Michael
You can't do this.,Jim
"Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.",Michael
That sounds terrible.,Jim
"Michael, please don't.",Pam
"[picking up phone] Hey, what up, Cynthia? [lowers phone, looking terrified]",Michael
"[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]",Jim
"Hold on a second, Cynthia.",Michael
"[hangs up Michael's phone, leaves room]",Jim
"Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly. [camera pans down from Michael's office window to parking lot below, Stanley is seen destroying Michael's Sebring with a crowbar] Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So... you can't stop love, I guess [Jim is seen displaying fetus picture on his desk as Pam smiles] and quite frankly, I don't think you should ever try.",Michael
"[talking head with Eric and Megan] I learned that a company can describe their internship as 'full of exciting experiences,' even if that's a lie. There's no regulation.",Maurie
I learned that half these people's email password is 'password.',Megan
I learned that a ream of paper is 300 sheets.,Eric
I thought it was 500.,Megan
Oh... I guess I didn't learn anything.,Eric
"I learned that if you look even the tiniest bit like Jet Li, Michael will call you 'Jet Li' all summer.",Maurie
[raises hand] Julia Stiles.,Megan
[raises hand] Alan Thicke.,Eric
[knock at Michael's Office door] Yeah?,Michael
You wanted to see me?,Oscar
"Yes, Oscar come on in. Close the door if you would. Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.",Michael
Yeah sure.,Oscar
I'm going in for a procedure today.,Michael
Is everything okay?,Oscar
"Yeah, it's routine. I'm just a little bit scared.",Michael
"I'm sure everything will be fine. [pulls up a chair] What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?",Oscar
It is a colonoscopy.,Michael
Okay.,Oscar
"In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? [Oscar looks irritated and frustrated] Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?",Michael
[sighs] Oh my God.,Oscar
"My main concern, should I have a safe word?",Michael
Yeah. [Oscar gets up and walks out],Oscar
"So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?",David Wallace
"Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.",Michael
"Okay, I will look at it Monday.",David
"Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you'll get it Weds.",Michael
"Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room?",David
Sure.,Jim
"Hey, Good luck.",Pam
"Oh right, this thing. I remember now. [whispers to Jim] What's this about?",Michael
"Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.",Jim
It's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there.,Michael
"No, ah it's okay Michael. We got it.",David
Really?,Michael
Yeah.,David
"Alright, do you mind if it sit this out? I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out.",Michael
[nods] Okay. [Jim smiles and waves to Pam],David
"Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me? No, because we are the Three Amigos. And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting. [shrugs]",Michael
Hey let me escort you to your desk.,Michael
"Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.",Pam
"You and Jim are close, huh?",Michael
"Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.",Pam
"Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you...",Michael
"Ummm, I don't know.",Pam
"Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.",Michael
"Did I? Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious.",Pam
"If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar. That's how it works. They inherit things through the breast milk.",Michael
Please don't talk about my breast milk.,Pam
I just don't want you to lie to me. I don't want you to ever lie to me. Have I ever lied to you?,Michael
Yeah.,Pam
I just don't want you to.,Michael
"I was rushing to fill an order. I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf. Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me.",Darryl
And that's how you broke your ankle?,Toby
Yes.,Darryl
"Hmmm, interesting. How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?",Dwight
"This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.",Darryl
"Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country. I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.",Dwight
"If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.",Darryl
"Nnnnn, that's not... okay.",Dwight
Be quiet.,Darryl
I'm talking about... hmmm.,Dwight
I will send this off to corporate. Make sure you hold on to your medical bills. Feel better.,Toby
"Thanks T-Man, later. [fist bumps Toby}",Darryl
"So long Darryl, feel better... [to Toby] He's lying.",Dwight
He has a doctor's note.,Toby
"Oh? From who, Dr. J? Look, you really need to investigate this. People don't just fall off of ladders.",Dwight
A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house. It was on the news.,Toby
Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake? [imitating Darryl] Y'all having birthday cake?,Dwight
That's not a very good Darryl.,Toby
Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?,Dwight
Hmmm.,Toby
It just doesn't add up.,Dwight
"Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point. The ladder didn't reach the top shelf. I don't know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel. [impression] I'll punch you in da mush, see.",Toby
"[walks into conference room on his cell phone, interrupting David and Jim] Uh huh, well if he doesn't like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired. Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right now. I will... I love you too. Bye.",Michael
Who was that?,Jim
Sorry about that. What'd I miss?,Michael
"Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don't mind.",David
"Do not mind! Yes, I do! No, I don't. Yes, I do! No, I don't mind. Catch you guys on the flippity flop. Oh this... call waiting. [answers his phone] Yeah, uh huh, well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes.",Michael
[spying on David and Jim] They've been in there a while.,Creed
Yeah.,Michael
Can't be good.,Creed
Nope.,Michael
Think they're talking about me?,Creed
"No, I think they're talking about me.",Michael
"Yeah, that makes way more sense. Okay thanks boss.",Creed
"What is Jim telling him? That I can't handle this job? That 's bull crap. That is bull crap. Although, it has been chaotic lately. Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients. I will tell you there has been work everyday. Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here.",Michael
Hey Kelly.,Pam
"Ugh, so jealous of your boobs.",Kelly
"Thank you. Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.",Pam
Is Ryan going?,Kelly
"I don't know, he hasn't RSVP'd yet.",Pam
"We invited everyone in the office to our wedding. Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls. [whispers] Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls. [normal volume] Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday off, if they came. So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.",Pam
"Here's the deal. I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time. That came out wrong. It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim.",Kelly
What can I do for ya Hoss?,Andy
[staring into the conference room] How are your sales doin'?,Michael
"How are my sales doin'? Busted. My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy. You're not buying it, you're good. Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately. I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer.",Andy
Again with the cousin.,Phyllis
"Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay. 'Hey Andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha.'",Andy
"Shhh, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room, okay?",Michael
Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I'm completely overwhelmed.,Michael
"You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work? Well, I don't believe that. I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart. It is just elegant.",Michael
[in the cheese cart] Be my eyes.,Michael
You got it.,Andy
What have we here?,Stanley
"Oh, just backing up and turning around.",Andy
"Hey, we're gonna do this...",Kevin
"Dit, dit, dit, dit, it's not for you. [enters the conference room] Pardon moi, Messieurs. I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.",Andy
Cheese platter?,David
"Oui, Oui, Monsieur. From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar. Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan. Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you'll find both challenging and delicious. At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing. If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese. Bon appetit.",Andy
"Alright, well I should go. Thanks for this. You've given me a lot to think about. Please promise me you won't do anything until we speak.",David
"No, I won't. Alright, thanks for giving me your time, I appreciate it.",Jim
Thank you Jim.,David
"Erin, is Michael around?",David
I think he's around here...,Erin
"[crawls out of the cheese cart unseen] Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me. How you doin'?",Michael
"Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?",David
"Yes, definitely.",Michael
[spying at Darryl's house] Sounds like a EMDP-40.,Toby
"Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.",Dwight
You're into trains?,Toby
I have been my whole life.,Dwight
Wow.,Toby
I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.,Dwight
That's so cool.,Toby
Yeah.,Dwight
"Wow, I'd love to take a look at that.",Toby
"Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.",Dwight
"Well, you know, 'cause of the trains.",Toby
"Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming.",Dwight
"Uhh, oh boy, oh boy.",Toby
"Here, get down! He's not using crutches! Get the camera!",Dwight
Get over there! Get over there!,Toby
"Oh, worker's comp, my ass!",Dwight
"I can't believe this. [mistaking Darryl's sister for Darryl] Hey you, ass****!",Toby
Toby...,Dwight
You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?,Toby
Ooohhh... [crashes car into garbage cans] Oh man! You okay?,Dwight
Just keep going.,Toby
Hey Ryan.,Pam
Hey.,Ryan
"So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding.",Pam
"Yeah, I might stop by.",Ryan
It costs about $75 per person.,Pam
"Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.",Ryan
Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not?,Pam
"Yes, I'm coming to your wedding.",Ryan
"Okay, Ryan Howard, yes.",Pam
"Probably, yes.",Ryan
"Kelly Kapoor, yes.",Pam
Are you sure you're okay with these new responsibilites?,David
Look who you're talking to.,Michael
I'm just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone's talents.,David
"Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.",Michael
What about Jim? Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?,David
[looks at Jim] Permission to speak on the record?,Michael
Please do.,David
"Jim is like Big Bird. He is tall and yellow and very nice. But would I put him in charge? No, I don't think so. Because Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions. I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.",Michael
I thought you liked Jim?,David
"Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report... right here. Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.",Michael
"[reading performance report] 'Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is.'",David
"It's not very well written, but you get the gist.",Michael
Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?,David
I can just continue to run it myself.,Michael
Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position.,David
This was Jim's idea?,Michael
Mmhmm.,David
"Wow. Ummm, well I'd have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.",Michael
"Ummm... okay, here's the thing though. The plan doesn't work unless we have someone to replace you. I was hoping... plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer. We may have to replace him.",David
"I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help. Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.",Jim
Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second.,David
Sure.,Jim
"[after talking to David, Jim looks dejected] I can't help but feel partially responsible.",Michael
[shakes jelly beans] Little pick me up? [Jim accepts] Oh those are the best. Little sugar rush.,Michael
"When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?",Jim
Well we did talk about how handsome you are.,Michael
Why don't we head in your office to talk?,Jim
"Oh what a week, God. We said... I know there were certain things we said...",Michael
"Michael, look I'll just be honest with you. Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion. I actually think that talk went really well. And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.",Jim
"Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird... it's kinda weirding me out. Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy.",Michael
"Michael, did you say anything?",Jim
"Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.",Michael
Really?,Jim
Yes!,Michael
You will? Wanna do it right now?,Jim
Yes.,Michael
I tried to keep Michael in the dark. I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.,Jim
I need to see your pupils. I need to see if they're dilated.,Dwight
If they were dilated...,Toby
Toby! Dwight! Is that them?,Darryl
Definitely.,Gwenneth
"You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.",Darryl
We thought that she was you.,Dwight
Why would you think a lady is me?,Darryl
Are you... are you serious? Be... cause you look exactly alike. Am I the only one? Are you getting this?,Dwight
"No, nah. I don't see it.",Toby
"Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.",Darryl
"Aww, Darryl.",Dwight
C'mon Gwenneth.,Darryl
Sad.,Gwenneth
[on phone] This is David.,David
"Hey David, this is Michael Scott. [Jim pushes speaker phone button] Michael Scott here.",Michael
Yep.,David
Just wanted to talk to you about Jim Halpert. I understand that he did not receive the promotion. And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.,Michael
"So, what, you're changing your mind about Jim?",David
"Absolutely, [turns speakerphone off] not. [turns speakerphone back on] Like I said before, Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job.",Michael
"Michael, it seems like you're cutting in and out... This is not what you said earlier.",David
"Wha... here's the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.",Michael
"Well, it doesn't change what you showed me in Jim's file.",David
"Well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly. That file had been falsified. Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.",Michael
"Michael, I really don't know what's going on [police sirens in background] down there, but... oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit.",David
"Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we're here to apologize ahh...",Toby
Cool.,Darryl
Wait! They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.,Dwight
What?,Toby
"He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.",Dwight
Stupidest thing I've ever heard.,Darryl
Really? Then why is there new wood only on one railing? Hmmm? We should check the security tapes Toby.,Dwight
"Well, I don't think there's any reason to check 'em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain...",Toby
"Alright, yeah fine so whatever...",Darryl
Yes!,Dwight
You really did it...,Toby
"Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.",Dwight
And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.,Darryl
Phhhht. No judge is gonna believe that...,Dwight
"Ahhh, kay. Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives.",Toby
So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork. We worked it out.,Toby
"Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face. Alright, Just do it.",Michael
How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.,Jim
"I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam, [starts to choke up] and now I don't wanna lose the baby.",Michael
"So instead, you screwed me?",Jim
That's what she...,Michael
No.,Jim
David Wallace is calling.,Erin
Kind of in the middle of something here.,Michael
Should I tell him you'll call him back?,Erin
"I, yeah... no, I'll tell him myself. Let's both.",Michael
[on phone] Hello.,Michael
"Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you?",David
"No, it's just us.",Michael
"Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please.",David
"Oh, oh, well here he is right now. [Michael knocks on desk] Come in. [Makes sound effects for door opening and footsteps and points to Jim to answer]",Michael
Hi David.,Jim
"Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool. But it only works if everyone's on board.",David
Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.,Michael
We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton. Both of you guys working as co-managers. Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.,David
"Wow, that sounds pretty cool.",Jim
"I like that, so manager and co-manager.",Michael
"Co-manager and Co-manager. See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs.",David
Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.,Michael
"Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second. [Michael picks up phone] Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything. If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay. Is that what you want to do?",David
"Okay people, listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...",Dwight
"Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?",Michael
I'm... I was making it.,Dwight
"Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.",Michael
Co-manager of what?,Stanley
"Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.",Michael
What's happening to you Michael?,Phyllis
"What's happening to me? I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together. Jim Halpert, welcome.",Michael
[shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them],Jim
AHHHHHHHHHHHH!,Dwight
"Niagara Falls in October? Pfft, hells yeah.",Meredith
Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?,Pam
"Nah, I'll just tell you now, easier.",Meredith
"Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging...",Pam
"I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs. I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you.",Meredith
"You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.",Pam
Uh huh.,Meredith
To ask for directions..,Pam
Right...,Meredith
And you will eat whatever is fanciest?,Pam
Unless there's ribs. [leaves],Meredith
Rude.,Angela
"So rude, right?",Pam
Mmm hmmm.,Angela
"[sits down] Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day. It's incredible.",Pam
"Pam, my bag was there...",Angela
[in Michael's office] Could you please sign my expense report?,Dwight
"No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.",Michael
[in Jim's office] Sign this.,Dwight
"Ah, ah, ah. Where's the 'please'? We're not animals.",Jim
Sign it.,Dwight
"No, not without a 'please.'",Jim
Idiot.,Dwight
[in Michael's office] I have a complaint about Jim.,Dwight
That is not big picture.,Michael
"I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.",Dwight
... Okay.,Michael
Jim won't sign my expense report.,Dwight
That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.,Michael
"No, that is huge.",Dwight
You're trying to trick me.,Michael
This has to do--,Dwight
"Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.",Michael
[in Jim's office] I'd like to lodge a complaint.,Dwight
I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?,Jim
You!,Dwight
Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?,Jim
One minute ago.,Dwight
Okay. And how do you feel?,Jim
Angry.,Dwight
All right. Did he hit you?,Jim
No.,Dwight
Did you cry?,Jim
No.,Dwight
Did you feel like crying?,Jim
No.,Dwight
I'm just gonna write 'held back tears.',Jim
"Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.",Dwight
"If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.",Jim
I'm not cr-- uhh!,Dwight
"I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! [claps hands and stands up] Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!",Dwight
"[at the door] Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.",Erin
"Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.",Michael
Michael...,Jim
Yes?,Michael
Can I talk to you in my office for a second?,Jim
"Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?",Michael
Can I also be a boss?,Stanley
"Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?",Oscar
I have noticed that we--,Jim
Welcome.,Michael
Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.,Jim
Mm-hmm.,Michael
"And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--",Jim
Disruptive.,Michael
Yes.,Jim
"No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important.",Michael
"Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.",Jim
Let's do.,Michael
"Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.",Jim
"N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?",Michael
I am.,Jim
"Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets...",Michael
Right.,Jim
"At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.",Michael
"Yes, I agree.",Jim
"Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust.",Michael
I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.,Jim
"You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.",Michael
You mean on a weekend?,Jim
Yes.,Michael
How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.,Jim
Alright. No more meetings this week.,Michael
Really? You just agreed to that?,Jim
I can be very suprising.,Michael
What's going on?,Phyllis
"I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant.",Pam
"You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.",Ryan
"Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?",Phyllis
"We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much.",Pam
"It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?",Pam
Perfect. I hate registries.,Phyllis
"Oh, good.",Pam
"My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?",Phyllis
"No, we're not.",Pam
Good. Good.,Phyllis
Mm-hmm?,Michael
"[walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.",Jim
"Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.",Michael
"Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?",Jim
"Stanley, you don't need to answer that.",Michael
Stanley?,Jim
"If you don't smell this, you're fired.'",Stanley
"Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.",Jim
What do you mean by 'these people'?,Michael
"Michael, this is a conference room meeting.",Jim
"Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.",Michael
That's not what I meant.,Jim
"Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.",Michael
I disagree.,Jim
What do you guys think? [all start talking at the same time],Michael
"Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?",Jim
"No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.",Michael
"That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.",Jim
That is not what Wallace told us.,Michael
That's exactly what Wallace told us.,Jim
That is not the way I heard it.,Michael
"I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C. Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.",Kelly
"It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around.",Michael
"I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.",Jim
"No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace. [Michael pulls out his cell phone] I will call David Wallace.",Michael
David Wallace is on line two for you guys.,Erin
Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just--,Michael
"Hey, David. You got Jim here.",Jim
"Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager.",Michael
"Hey guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it.",David Wallace
"Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.",Michael
Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.,Jim
It's probably a little of both.,David Wallace
Which is it more of?,Michael
Excuse me?,David Wallace
"David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.",Jim
"Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you-- are you texting me?",David Wallace
I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.,Michael
"Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it?",David Wallace
"Nope, not at all.",Jim
"No, it will not be. I am on top of it.",Michael
Very good.,David Wallace
"Alright, thanks alot, David.",Jim
"Talk to you later-- [Jim hangs up] Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. [sighs, and claps hands once] Alright, I am looking forward to this.",Michael
You don't have to lie.,Jim
"I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore.",Michael
Right.,Jim
All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.,Michael
Alright. Let's get started.,Jim
"Hey, why haven't we ever, um...",Creed
We have.,Meredith
"You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it.",Michael
"Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?",Jim
"No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim.",Michael
Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.,Jim
"Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?",Michael
It's hard to tell so far.,Jim
You use your brain too much.,Michael
"I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?",Jim
Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.,Michael
You just came up with that.,Jim
As I was saying it.,Michael
"Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.",Jim
[in nerdy voice] Con-- you look like a nerd.,Michael
Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.,Jim
Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.,Michael
Pro-- no favoritism.,Jim
"Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there.",Michael
"I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.",Jim
"Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where.",Kevin
I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.,Pam
Like money? Like you-- you want my money?,Kevin
Mm-hmm.,Pam
Will you take a check?,Kevin
Yeah.,Pam
"Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, 'To love's eternal glory.'",Kevin
Okay.,Pam
Wait til' Monday.,Kevin
Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! 'Mrs. Pam Halpert!' That's the first time I've seen it in writing!,Pam
"You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.",Jim
That will not go over well.,Michael
"I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...",Jim
"Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself.",Michael
I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.,Jim
"No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.",Michael
Michael.,Jim
And then another--,Michael
"Look, you have a lot of strengths.",Jim
"Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.",Michael
I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.,Jim
Ha! That-- I am not known for that!,Michael
But there is a reason why I'm here!,Jim
Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!,Michael
"No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!",Jim
"Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?",Michael
I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!,Jim
Ah.,Michael
"At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.",Jim
"Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!",Michael
"But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.",Jim
"Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? [laughs] You call it.",Michael
[leave the conference room to address everyone],Jim
[to the camera] This had better be terrible.,Michael
"Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.",Jim
Wait. Seriously?!,Meredith
"Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.",Jim
"Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people.",Oscar
"But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?",Angela
"Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.",Oscar
"Ooh, easy. That's not it at all.",Jim
Well?,Oscar
"Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.",Jim
"[walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What's going on?",Kelly
Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.,Kevin
What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!,Kelly
"Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?",Oscar
No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!,Kelly
This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!,Dwight
"Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--",Jim
"What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!",Dwight
Exactly!,Oscar
Totally!,Kevin
We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.,Oscar
Yes.,Creed
"Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!",Angela
My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!,Meredith
Yeah.,Kevin
"Her kid needs shoes, Jim!",Dwight
What the hell?! [everyone complaining at Jim],Meredith
"Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]",Jim
"That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you [someone growns in disgust], and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--",Michael
What are you talking about Michael?,Angela
We just need to hear your plan for our raise.,Stanley
My plan-- a man-- panama.,Michael
That's not how that goes.,Andy
You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct...,Meredith
"Thank you, Meredith.",Jim
...when he was telling us his dumbass plan.,Meredith
"We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?",Oscar
"Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? [all say yes] Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.",Michael
"Again, that gives us no information.",Oscar
"This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!",Phyllis
What about a raise based on merit?,Michael
Rank each person individually?,Jim
"Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.",Michael
"[sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]",Jim
Are you making a--,Michael
Nope. I'm numbering the paper.,Jim
[everyone talking to the camera] Just--,Oscar
"Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.",Kevin
It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!,Angela
I am so pissed at this company!,Meredith
[out the side of his mouth] And Jim!,Dwight
Yeah. Who said that?,Meredith
I think it was Creed.,Dwight
Yep.,Creed
"[to camera] It's going really well, actually.",Jim
"[to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]",Jim
Toby.,Michael
He's not a part of this. You know that.,Jim
Just wanted to draw a picture of him.,Michael
"Okay, your move.",Jim
Alright! Who to pick? [walking around the table] Who to pick?,Michael
Here we go.,Jim
I... will skip a turn.,Michael
"Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.",Jim
I need more time.,Michael
"Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in]",Erin
"People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.",Dwight
"Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table] That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.",Dwight
What the hell?!,Oscar
Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.,Dwight
"Hey, what are you guys doing in here?",Michael
What does a bean mean?,Kevin
"Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?",Pam
"Michael, what does a bean mean?",Kevin
Jim?,Pam
I was just trying to be unbiased.,Jim
What does a bean mean?!,Kevin
Someone please explain it to Kevin.,Oscar
Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.,Meredith
Not according to the beans.,Phyllis
This is how you make this important decision?,Angela
"There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me. [starts to take Stanley's beans, Stanley swats Andy's hand with his crossword puzzle] That is ridiculous. This is how it works. [everyone continues to argue]",Andy
It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!,Phyllis
"Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise.",Andy
"Yeah, I would, too.",Phyllis
"Are we idiots? [gets up, starts walking around] What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!",Dwight
I say no.,Phyllis
"No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? [all groan] Okay.",Dwight
"[leaving his office, hurrying to Jim's office]",Michael
What does a bean mean?,Kevin
[in Jim's office] How you doing?,Michael
"Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.",Jim
"Oh, what are you usually?",Michael
Six. You?,Jim
"Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero.",Michael
"I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?",Jim
"I know, I know.",Michael
We tried to find the fairest way to do it.,Jim
"Yes, we did.",Michael
I just-- what?,Jim
"Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you. [leaves office]",Michael
Michael!,Phyllis
Michael!,Kevin
Come on! This isn't fair!,Phyllis
[to camera] Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?,Jim
"[at Michael return to Jim's office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!",Phyllis
[Michael give Jim a 'World's Best Boss' mug] Thank you.,Jim
You're welcome.,Michael
What's in here?,Jim
"Gin. [toast, sip]",Michael
Ooh!,Jim
[someone knocks] Just pretend we're not here.,Michael
Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?,Ryan
"Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you.",Pam
"Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?",Ryan
$100 now for sure.,Pam
"Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...",Ryan
"Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred.",Pam
"Instead of $5,000 a year from now?",Ryan
How sure is this?,Pam
The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.,Pam
"I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?",Pam
We would really appreciate it.,Jim
Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.,Dwight
"Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.",Pam
Now this is getting ridiculous.,Phyllis
"Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.",Dwight
All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone.,Meredith
I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace.,Pam
"[Dwight peels a hard-boiled egg at his desk, sniffs it and takes a bite; Pam stares at him, picks up her trash can and pukes into it] Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And... frankly so does talking about it. So... wow... [Andy, Phyllis, Meredith, Erin, Oscar and Angela all proceed to throw up in various places while Creed looks on eating a bowl of noodles; Dwight stares shocked; Pam wipes her mouth with a satisfied look]",Andy
[standing next to a car decorated for leaving a wedding] What do you think? I spent all morning on it.,Michael
It is really special.,Jim
"Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great.",Pam
It's just a really important day for me.,Michael
"Well, congrats.",Jim
Thanks.,Michael
"Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.",Erin
"Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.",Jim
"So... you're going to provide them, then?",Kevin
No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.,Jim
What the hell?,Kevin
Come on. You've got to be kidding me.,Dwight
Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.,Pam
Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.,Jim
Decent people everywhere will get offended.,Angela
"Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned.",Pam
"Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.",Angela
That's nice.,Jim
"You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding.",Pam
"Really, Pam...",Angela
Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time. [hugs Angela],Michael
Ow! He pinched me!,Angela
No.,Michael
Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married.,Pam
We'll see.,Dwight
"Thank you, Dwight.",Pam
Good-bye.,Jim
See you later. [others say good-bye],Pam
"And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara.",Michael
"What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara. [laughter]",Andy
Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke.,Michael
No... I didn't steal your joke.,Andy
Yes. I said that yesterday.,Michael
But you can say that about anything.,Dwight
Dwight...,Michael
"What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.",Dwight
Oh yeah.,Kevin
"No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke.",Michael
It's easy. That's what I'm saying.,Dwight
"This is what I'm talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!",Michael
Pam and Jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.,Michael
I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.,Dwight
Get out of here.,Michael
Yes.,Dwight
"Oh, my God, Dwight.",Michael
"For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster.",Dwight
There's... a name.,Michael
Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.,Dwight
"Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.",Michael
Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.,Dwight
Ok.,Micheal
"She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.",Dwight
Is that all you have on her?,Michael
"Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.",Dwight
You're an idiot.,Michael
"People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It's the hair-- [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I'm going. [long beep] God.",Kevin
"[in Andy's car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to? It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know.",Andy
This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.,Kelly
Mmm-hmm. Erin?,Andy
Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.,Erin
Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom.,Andy
"[in car] Hey, my aunt told me something neat.",Pam
Yeah?,Jim
She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.,Pam
"Oh, wow. That's cool.",Jim
Yeah.,Pam
"[aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.",Jim
Oh.,Pam
Lousy Picture.,Jim
We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.,Pam
"[in car, Michael driving] Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.",Michael
What? No way!,Dwight
Those glasses are super dark.,Michael
Oh. God.,Dwight
"Alright. We need some tunes, I think.",Michael
You know what? I made you a cd...,Dwight
You did?,Michael
Mmm-hmm.,Dwight
That was nice of you.,Michael
This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.,Dwight
"Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.",Michael
"You're gonna like this. [Dwight's voice on the cd] 'Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--' [Michael turns off cd]",Dwight
Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?,Michael
Yeah. It's practical.,Dwight
No. No. That's not how it works.,Michael
"Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.",Jim
Halpert...,Front Desk Clerk
And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.,Jim
Great.,Front Desk Clerk
"I know. We're pretty excited, too.",Jim
Can we take a look at the suite now?,Pam
"Oh, I'm sorry. Somebody just checked in.",Front Desk Clerk
Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?,Pam
"Oh, no. Just an individual. That man over there.",Front Desk Clerk
Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed. [laughs],Andy
I don't like that.,Jim
"I'm gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.",Pam
Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott.,Michael
One moment while I check.,Front Desk Clerk
The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.,Dwight
Mmm-hmm.,Michael
"I'm sorry, sir, but I'm not seeing you in here. When did you make your reservation?",Front Desk Clerk
I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.,Michael
"Oh, ok. Unfortunately, sir, the block only applies to the rate. I'm afraid we're all sold out.",Front Desk Clerk
Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number: Romeo. Tango. G7745.,Dwight
Yes. Schrute.,Front Desk Clerk
And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?,Dwight
Sure. No problem.,Front Desk Clerk
Ok.,Dwight
"Here's your key, Mr. Schrute.",Front Desk Clerk
"Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.",Michael
No way. What if I meet someone?,Dwight
"I'm staying in your-- Come on, Dwight.",Michael
No. No.,Dwight
I would do the same for you.,Michael
You would?,Dwight
Yes.,Michael
Really?,Dwight
Yes... just go--,Michael
"Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.",Dwight
Oh. Thank God.,Michael
"Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?",Dwight
Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why.,Michael
Please?,Dwight
"If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.",Michael
Mmm-hmm.,Dwight
Ok.,Michael
Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! [rips reservation out of Michael's hand] That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.,Dwight
I don't have a room?,Michael
No you do not.,Dwight
Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.',Michael
It worked.,Dwight
Jerk.,Michael
"When Mary was denied a room at the inn... Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we don't know what happens because that story hasn't been told yet.",Michael
Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Hudson.,Stanley
Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?,Michael
Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.,Stanley
Not in the same bed. In the other bed.,Michael
I got one queen size bed.,Stanley
You... are... kidding me.,Michael
"A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.",Stanley
"I'm not a physics major, Stanley. I'm just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?",Michael
Oh. Gross.,Erin
Blow my brains out.,Kelly
That's rude.,Michael
"Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want.",Toby
"You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.",Michael
"So, which one is Pam's grandma?",Mr. Halpert
"Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.",Pam
"Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?",Jim
No.,Mr. Halpert
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word.",Michael
"Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.",Jim
Oh.,Mr. Halpert
How ya doin'?,Michael
Hi.,Mr. Halpert
Nice to meet you.,Michael
Nice to meet you.,Mr. Halpert
Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--,Michael
"Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.",Jim
"[talking quietly, trying not to move his lips]That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.",Michael
Pretty sure everyone heard that.,Jim
Didn't move my lips.,Michael
"Hey, Mema.",Pam
I wasn't sure about your branch of the family. After I heard about your parent's divorce. But you and Jim are just perfect. God bless you.,Mema
Oh. Thank you... but nobody's perfect.,Pam
Well... I wouldn't care to live if I thought that.,Mema
Mr. Beesly. How are ya?,Jim
I'd like you to meet Christy Kelly.,Mr. Beesly
"Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?",Jim
[laughs] No no. She's my girlfriend. Hey? Can you make room at the head table?,Mr. Beesly
"From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report.",Dwight
Why would they make the bad man a boss if you're so much smarter?,Little Girl
"Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.",Dwight
Ewwww!,Kids
That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.,Dwight
"Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor.",Pam
Pleased to meet you.,Oscar
"I'm sorry, it's Kevin. I thought it was Gil?",Penny
She thought I was your boyfriend.,Kevin
You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?,Oscar
"Oscar, it was an honest mistake.",Pam
Him? Him?,Oscar
"Oscar, I would be proud to date you.",Kevin
I'm sorry.,Penny
I'm not gay. I'm Kevin.,Kevin
"Nice to meet you, Kevin.",Penny
Yes.,Kevin
You owe me and apology.,Oscar
I'm so sorry.,Penny
Are you seeing anyone right now?,Kevin
She has a boyfriend. He's out of town.,Pam
Cool.,Kevin
[to a girl sitting next to him] I was the youngest VP in the company history.,Ryan
"More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories.",Meredith
Um... also--,Ryan
How did Meredith get put at the young people's table?,Andy
She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.,Kevin
What? You're kid-- That's-- You're--,Andy
"Jim and Pam, I can't tell you how happy I am to be here.",Isabel
"Head table, where I belong.",Michael
It's just for family.,Dwight
"Well, who's that one?",Michael
"Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. [laughs] In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.",Dwight
"What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?",Michael
That's a very good record.,Dwight
"Alright, so I'll be like, 'You're so sweet guys and so kind'.",Pete
"That's when I'll do the face, like-",Tom
"Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and--",Pete
A noogie?,Tom
You know what? Never too married for a noogie.,Pete
"They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.",Michael
"Pam, you've got the greatest smile and you're body is really fine.",Tom
Smoking.,Pete
Hoping it'll make our wives take it up a notch.,Tom
A little mo' cardio.,Pete
"That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.",Michael
Knight Rider.,Dwight
That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.,Michael
No.,Dwight
"That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. [no one is laughing]",Michael
Very smart.,Dwight
And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.,Michael
No.,Jim
Yeah. Go ahead.,Michael
"Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.",Jim
Douche.,Pete
"Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?",Jim
Like... a year.,Pam
"I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So... I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--",Jim
What's obvious? Why can't Pam drink?,Mema
"Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.",Jim
"[clears throat] Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--",Michael
They were living together?,Mema
"Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation.",Michael
Michael.,Jim
"When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation.",Michael
"Oh, my God. Please.",Jim
When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman--,Michael
Michael.,Pam
...but it's different for the-- ok. Ok.,Michael
Michael. Stop.,Pam
"Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.",Michael
Alright.,Jim
Jim.,Michael
To waiting.,Jim
[quiet and scattered] To waiting.,Everyone
"I should have known. The hotels television set had a movie on called 'Bruno' last night. The remote control had so darn many buttons on it, I couldn't turn it off. So I had to just sit there while it happened to me. I wondered, 'How could they pick such a hotel?' Hmmm. Now I know.",Mema
Mema.,Pam
That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.,Michael
I can't believe it was me.,Jim
"I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.",Michael
Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?,Jim
I have not found that to be the case.,Michael
"Hey, smooth guys.",Pam
I'm so sorry.,Jim
"Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.",Michael
Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning.,Pam
"Oh, my God. Are you serious?",Jim
There's gonna be a free room?,Michael
"Hi, Mema. It's Michael.",Michael
Oh. You're that foul guy that kept talking about intercourse.,Mema
Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?,Michael
"I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she's better than everybody.",Michael
I want to go to bed but I can't. I can't turn that television off.,Mema
"Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there. [turns off tv]",Michael
Oh. Thank you.,Mema
You're welcome.,Michael
It was that horrible Charlie Rose.,Mema
"Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life.",Michael
People are like cats and dogs these days.,Mema
Exactly.,Michael
This used to be such a great country.,Mema
I know.,Michael
I don't know what happened to it.,Mema
"They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema.",Michael
"You mean, Sylvia.",Mema
"Yes, and if it's a boy they will call it Sylvio.",Michael
Partay. Room 639.,Andy
Yes!,Kevin
"Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.",Andy
That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?,Kevin
Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!,Andy
No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.,Andy
"If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come.",Andy
And where do you think you're going?,Angela
I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.,Pam
"Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?",Angela
I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.,Pam
Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.,Angela
[sighs] Nevermind.,Pam
Are you sure?,Angela
Yeah.,Pam
It'll be fun.,Angela
No.,Pam
What are you wearing?,Michael
"What? It's a casual, social outfit.",Dwight
"Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight.",Michael
No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.,Dwight
"Ok. [Dwight howls] That's not appropriate. [Dwight continues howling] Uncool. Uncool, Dwight. [they both howl] Ok. Ok. Come on. Let's go. [both howl as they exit]",Michael
It's a good idea.,Kevin
It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.,Oscar
"Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.",Kevin
"I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.",Dwight
"Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.",Michael
Wait. You're worried about your horses? That's cool. How many horses do you have?,Isabel
Nine and three-quarters.,Dwight
"I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'.",Dwight
"[talking to an attractive woman] Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar.",Michael
Michael.,Dwight
Yes.,Michael
Drop this one. Abort.,Dwight
Why?,Michael
I found twins.,Dwight
"Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.",Michael
Aren't they magnificent?,Dwight
"They're men, Dwight.",Michael
I love finding a good set of twins.,Dwight
Something is wrong with you.,Michael
[everyone is dancing] Go Meredith. Nice moves.,Erin
"You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.",Andy
"Lame! What else you got, Andy?",Kelly
How about a little bit of this.,Andy
Oh yeah. What else you got?,Erin
What else you got?,Kevin
Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo! [Andy does a split and screams out in pain],Andy
What else you got?,Erin
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. [knocks on Pam's door] Pam? [knocks again],Kevin
I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.,Andy
What?,Pam
I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.,Andy
"Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours.",Pam
Everyone else is too drunk. Just don't let me die here.,Andy
"[on the phone] Hey, hey! Where are you? Can you take Andy to the hospital?",Pam
[over phone] What?,Jim
He tore his scrotum dancing.,Pam
[over phone] What?,Jim
He is in my room icing his balls.,Pam
[over phone] What?,Jim
Please stop saying what. Can you take him?,Pam
"Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.",Jim
Your brothers took you out drinking?,Pam
Uh...,Jim
"[over phone] Is that Pam? Hey, have her come out! Have her come out! It would be like Coyote Ugly.",Michael
That's Michael. You're out with Michael?,Pam
[over phone] And Dwight.,Jim
[over phone] Hey-O!,Dwight
"Pam, it just happened.",Jim
"Okay, fine. I'll take him.",Pam
"I love you. Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!",Jim
[over phone] I love you! [laughs],Michael
Are you pushing me off the phone?,Pam
No. Let's talk for a long time.,Jim
Goodbye. [hangs up phone],Pam
Mmm! It's after midnight. [points at Jim],Michael
You're married. [hugs Jim] He's married!,Michael and Dwight
Congratulations.,Dwight
That's not how that works.,Jim
Oh my goodness.,Dwight
Oh my God. You're not going to be able to talk back.,Michael
You'll have Pam to answer to.,Dwight
"She'll be sitting home saying, 'Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons.' [Dwight laughs] 'And... and clip my toenails.'",Michael
Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair. I want to watch TV.',Dwight
Now you sound like Kermit.,Michael
Are you sure this is the right way?,Andy
"Nope. I, like you, have never been here before.",Pam
"Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum.",Andy
"Look, I'm not the one who asked you to do a split when you've never done one before.",Pam
I was trying to liven things up a little bit. I was kinda doing your job so--,Andy
My job? My job is to get married in the morning. That's my job.,Pam
"Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--",Andy
"[Pam swerves the car back and forth] Ow, ow!",Andy
[snickers] I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding. Ah yeah. She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.,Andy
"Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?",Pam
No. No that was real.,Andy
"[folding his pants on top of the ice machine, man walks in with ice bucket] Why don't you take a picture. It'll last longer. God. Can't I get a little privacy?",Michael
[Kevin rings bell at the front desk] Good morning. How can I help you?,Hotel Employee
"I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet.",Kevin
You must be Mr. Malone. One moment please.,Hotel Employee
Thank you.,Kevin
[whispers to manager] Sir. It's the man with the shoes.,Hotel Employee
Mr. Malone. Your shoes are gone.,Hotel Manager
They were stolen?,Kevin
No. Destroyed.,Hotel Manager
What?,Kevin
The bag was opened by our shoe shine and the smell overcame him. I too smelled them and made the choice that they must be thrown away. Incinerated actually.,Hotel Manager
But that was my only pair of shoes.,Kevin
"It became a safety issue, sir.",Hotel Manager
Well... well damn-it.,Kevin
I can offer you a complimentary breakfast.,Hotel Employee
Okay.,Kevin
[walking out of hotel room with a woman] You have everything?,Dwight
Hmm-hmm.,Isabel
Cell phone? Charger?,Dwight
Yeah. So you sure you don't want breakfast? It's the most important meal of the day.,Isabel
"It really is. I'm not hungry. I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep. And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding. She needs you Isabel.",Dwight
"That's really sweet, Dwight. So I'll see you at the wedding?",Isabel
You know it.,Dwight
K. [they kiss],Isabel
"Okay, get out of here.",Dwight
Bye.,Isabel
Okay.,Dwight
"[passes Isabel] Hey, good morning. [to Dwight] It's about damn time. I haven't gone to the bathroom in a day and a half. [walks into hotel room] Oh my God, Dwight. This room is a pit.",Michael
[lays on bed] Really? I hadn't noticed. Too busy knocking boots.,Dwight
[watching Dwight eat breakfast] How can you eat like that?,Michael
I'm ravenous after a night of love making. You?,Dwight
"Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself.",Michael
"Hey, what was she like?",Dwight
She was cute. You know? She was hot. She was very hot. She made love like a tiger.,Michael
Brides side or grooms side? Or townie?,Dwight
She was from Europe.,Michael
No kidding.,Dwight
Uh-huh.,Michael
I bet she had hairy armpits.,Dwight
No.,Michael
"Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere.",Dwight
Wait a second. You're not into her? Are you kidding me?,Michael
No.,Dwight
She's Pam's best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe?,Michael
Oh please. Put a gun in my mouth.,Dwight
No... you're crazy.,Michael
Look. She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one. She's a bumpkin. Pass.,Dwight
She's-- okay. Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist? You have to take x-rays. You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth. You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in. It-- it--,Michael
You should ask her out.,Dwight
[stands up and walks away] I already have my European girlfriend.,Michael
If your hat hits me in the face one more time--,Stanley
That's funny. Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley's date],Phyllis
[sees Kevin's toupee] Oh my God.,Angela
Oh...,Oscar
Oscar. Angela.,Kevin
Are you in a lot of pain?,Erin
Oh cause of last night? No way. Reports have been exaggerated. Weddings make me very emotional. I um--I just have that side to me.,Andy
People say you cry all the time.,Erin
Well that's not--,Andy
Crotch injuries are the worst. You don't need to tell me.,Meredith
I wasn't telling you.,Andy
Is there still something there?,Meredith
Excuse me?,Andy
It didn't get torn off?,Meredith
"No, it didn't--nothing got torn off. Who told you that?",Andy
I may have told some people that. I'm nervous. I'm about to get married.,Jim
If you want to sit on this-- [hands Andy her wrap] I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis. Make it softer.,Erin
"It was my scrotum. Um, and it was. Thank you.",Andy
"Oh, here we go. They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need? I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special. I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory. [holds up painting] And I have another one of them in the nude. But that one is for me.",Michael
"I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.",Dwight
Is it zipping over your belly? Don't squish the baby.,Penny
Thank you weirdo.,Pam
everybody see Kristie's stupid blonde extensions? It's like they were made from a plastic broom.,Pam's mom
"Okay, here I come. [walks out in her wedding dress]",Pam
Oh darling! You look beautiful.,Pam's mom
Thanks mom.,Pam
"Oh, I hope he deserves you.",Pam's mom
He does.,Pam
Are you sure? Remember you don't have to do this. You don't.,Pam's mom
"Mom, you're totally projecting. You're being a drag.",Penny
"Yes. Thank you, mom.",Pam
"Hey, I'm going to go outside and talk to Dwight.",Isabel
"Okay great. [Isabel kisses her cheek] Yeah, I'll see you in a second. [pauses] Wait, what? [tries to follow, but veil gets caught on wall and tears] Oh! Oh no!",Pam
[answers cell phone] Hey!,Jim
Can you come here please?,Pam
Is this allowed?,Jim
"No. No, but I'm allowing it. Just come here.",Pam
[talking to a woman] That was an intelligent comment.,Dwight
Hello stranger. How do I look?,Isabel
"Oh. Fine. Isabel, [holds out hand] nice to see you. What do you want?",Dwight
Um... [shakes head] nothing. Anymore.,Isabel
"[turns back to other woman] So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement.",Dwight
"[to Isabel] Hey, hey... He's not sitting with me either. Where are you sitting? You need a seat buddy?",Michael
I'm standing. I'm a bridesmaid.,Isabel
"Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid. Where am I gonna go?",Michael
Hey.,Pam
Wow. You look--,Jim
Terrible.,Pam
So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry. Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey--,Jim
My veil tore. I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--,Pam
"[takes her hand] Hey. You look just as I imagined you would. Pam, you're so pretty.",Jim
[sighs] Thank you.,Pam
"And who cares? It's a stupid veil, right?",Jim
"No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and-- [Jim cuts off half his tie]",Pam
"There. Now we're even. [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]",Jim
[sighs] Everyone's driving me crazy. I know way too much about Andy's scrotum. [Jim chuckles] And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend. [sighs] This is supposed to be our wedding day. Why did we invite all these people?,Pam
I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down she wouldn't be a good wife.,Phyllis
Yes.,Angela
[to Kevin who is bouncing up and down] What are you doing?,Oscar
I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.,Kevin
How long do you take to pee?,Oscar
"The peeing is fast, Oscar. It's getting my tie back on.",Kevin
[to Pam's mom] Hey. Hi. Do you--would you have a snack in your purse? You're a mom. I just figured you might have--,Michael
"Oh, yeah--[hands Michael a snack]",Pam's mom
Oh! Eww... apricot. Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or--,Michael
No.,Pam's mom
Oh... okay. Were you saving it?,Michael
"Oh, no, no, no. That's okay. I was just--I've had a very rough weekend.",Pam's mom
I'm sorry. [puts food in his mouth] Ugh. Apricot. Made of real apes.,Michael
Do you think they canceled the wedding?,Erin
Relax. You'll get your shot at Jim. Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.,Angela
my weekend was bad so far.,Michael
Oh--,Pam's mom
"I came here hoping to meet somebody. You know, as you do at weddings. End up going to sleep by the vending machine. It was loud, but it was warm.",Michael
Oh that sounds awful.,Pam's mom
And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.,Michael
Oh--,Pam's mom
It is a terrible year for love.,Michael
Yeah. Guess it is.,Pam's mom
I'm thinking about having my sperm frozen.,Michael
"Excuse me, are you Michael Scott?",Tom Halpert
"Um, yeah.",Michel
Heard you might have a whoopee cushion on you.,Tom
Sisters in the can and we totally want to get her when she comes back.,Pete Halpert
"Oh, wow. That sounds hilarious. I do actually. [pulls whoopee cushion out of pocket and hands it to them] There you go. Use it in good health.",Michael
[laughing] Yes!,Tom and Pete
"Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. What is the etiquette on taking the gifts? Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?",Meredith
Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?,Stanley
"Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?",Kevin
No.,Stanley
Who would want it?,Kevin
"Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.",Oscar
Toby.,Dwight
What?,Toby
I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.,Dwight
[sighs],Toby
"[looks over and sees hole in his present] Crap. [sees turtle on the ground, goes over and picks it up] Come here you.",Dwight
Well I guess this weddings not going to happen. I wonder if this is it for them. [Jim and Pam walk in laughing],Toby
Hey. What happened?,Pam's dad
Where were you guys? Do you know how long I've been waiting here?,Ryan
"Well we are here now, so let's just--",Jim
[walks up] Yes! Yes! I have so much joy... in my heart... right now. How do I look?,Michael
You look great.,Jim
You look great.,Pam
[looks at Jim's cut tie] Wear a tie much?,Tom
[music starts playing and people start dancing down the isle] I begged them not to.,Penny
Mm-hmm.,Pam
I know you specifically put this song on your Do Not Play list.,Penny
Yes I did.,Pam
I'm sorry.,Penny
[smiles] Go ahead. I think it's your turn.,Pam
"Wait, what happened? You're okay with this?",Penny
"Yeah, I'm okay.",Pam
Okay then! [takes flower girl to dance down the isle],Penny
"Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.",Michael
Saw it.,Pam
"I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video. I knew we'd need a back-up plan. The boat was actually Plan C. The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago. Pretty much the day I met her.",Jim
"What an awesome party. The best wedding I've ever been too. I got six numbers. One more would have been a complete telephone number. This was epic. My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking. [sticks his feet into the hotel ice machine] Whoo. My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold. What a lovely hotel.",Kevin
"The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. 'Mental' is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because you're mental, if you don't have a good time. You have to enjoy it.",Michael
Well the 'fun' is in it. [conference room group chimes agreement.],Toby
Get out.,Michael
"[halfway out] Yeah, I know.",Toby
"Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake. But you can't just go right to the selling, you need 'small talk.' What topics can you use for small talk?",Michael
Golf.,Andy
Mmhm.,Michael
Stock market.,Andy
Mmhm.,Michael
Dave Matthews.,Andy
"Yes, what else?",Michael
"Uh, small things. Peas, ball bearings, dimes...",Creed
No.,Michael
The weekend!,Meredith
"Yeah! That's good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let's do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, 'So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?'",Michael
Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.,Meredith
All right...,Michael
He calls it an upper decker.,Meredith
"Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with.",Michael
Then do it.,Ryan
What?,Michael
Write a book.,Ryan
"[into mini recorder] The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I'm not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman...",Michael
"[Michael walks in office, man waits on couch] Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to.",Erin
"Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec. [whispers] Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?",Michael
In your schedule it just says nine til noon is 'creative space' and I thought this could be part of that.,Erin
Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.,Michael
You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says 'free play.',Erin
Push free play til tomorrow morning. [to Grotti] Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made.,Michael
Ah.,Grotti
Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.,Michael
"As a manager of business, you have a lot of pride.",Grotti
Mmhm.,Michael
But you also got a lot of responsibility,Grotti
Yep.,Michael
"None greater perhaps, than your need to be sure, that your small or large business is secure in the event of a covered loss.",Grotti
Okay.,Michael
"There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.",Michael
Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.,Kevin
What do you think?,Andy
I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.,Dwight
God forbid you... should have a fire in the warehouse.,Grotti
"Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.",Michael
"Yeah, and a truck, goes off the side of the road, there's injury.",Grotti
"Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.",Michael
You will be hearing from me Mr. Scott.,Grotti
"Okay, well.",Michael
I can be very very persistent.,Grotti
Do your worst. [they shake hands],Michael
"[Grotti knocks over coat stand grabbing his overcoat] Oh, great.",Michael
"Would you look at that people? What an unpredictable world we live in, huh?",Grotti
Mmhm.,Michael
What happened in there?,Andy
"Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.",Michael
Did he threaten you?,Dwight
"No Dwight, not everything is a threat.",Michael
Mobsters are!,Andy
There is no such things as monsters.,Michael
He drives an SUV!,Andy
"I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.",Dwight
"Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?",Oscar
"No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.",Dwight
"Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.",Michael
"All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation.",Andy
"For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.",Oscar
"I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.",Michael
"Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down!",Andy
Exactly.,Dwight
He did talk about a fire in the warehouse... and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.,Michael
"Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around]",Oscar
Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between 'sane and others.' Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The 'coalition for reason' is extremely weak.,Oscar
Oscar says I checked out huh? Huh. [nods head],Toby
"[over chatter] Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?",Michael
"Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'",Ryan
Okay.,Michael
What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?,Ryan
"Um it is, Grotti.",Michael
[groans] Oh no. Fabulous.,Andy and Dwight
What? What?,Oscar
"It's John Gotti, you idiot!",Andy
"It's, it's a completely different name!",Oscar
So he won't get caught!,Phyllis
Yeah. It's pretty close.,Andy
"No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.",Oscar
No I disagree. 'R' is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it 'murder.' And not 'muck-duck.',Dwight
Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.,Michael
Lock your door!,Dwight
I'm not gonna lock my door. [door closes. Then clicks locked],Michael
Hello?,Jim
Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.,Oscar
"Oscar! Uh, what is going on?",Jim
"It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.",Oscar
"Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so-",Jim
Hey Oscar. It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon.,Pam
"Pam, I'm sorry--",Oscar
"Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.",Pam
"You're right. You're right. [Pam hangs up] Oh, okay bye.",Oscar
It's Grotti. He's following up.,Michael
"Already? This, this guy is persistent!",Andy
[reads email] 'I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business.',Michael
That's bad.,Dwight
Yeah.,Michael
That's bad.,Dwight
"Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?",Michael
Yeah right! You heard him! He's gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.,Andy
"Okay, I'm calling the police.",Michael
"[hangs up, rips cord from phone] That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!",Andy
He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.,Dwight
All right.,Michael
"Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!",Andy
Shh!,Michael
You know what?,Dwight
That's not gonna happen.,Michael
That's an exaggeration.,Dwight
That's how it works!,Andy
What am I supposed to do here?,Michael
"When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back",Andy
I was thinking exactly the same thing.,Michael
"No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.",Dwight
Dwight...,Andy
"The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.",Dwight
"I don't know, I don't know about that.",Michael
"Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting.",Andy
"Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.",Dwight
Okay.,Andy
Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.,Dwight
[snaps fingers] I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.,Andy
"Hold on, hold on! Just-",Michael
"No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.",Andy
"All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone.",Michael
Well you're gonna have to. [overlaps] Dwight: We'll be right beside you.,Andy
What?,Andy
"[Andy dressed as a mechanic, Cornell hat on] What are you wearing? Who's Pat?",Michael
"Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing.",Andy
Do you know how to use it?,Dwight
"To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it.",Andy
"Let's go, come on. [whispers] God!",Michael
Should I change?,Andy
You're wearing loafers!,Dwight
Forget it! Forget it!,Michael
[Andy is playing with the tire iron] Take that thing off the table! Please!,Michael
Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.,Andy
Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.,Dwight
Oh! God! [smacks roaches],Andy
Oh my God!,Michael
You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-,Dwight
"Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.",Michael
Hello.,Michael
Mr. Scott.,Grotti
Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.,Michael
Hi. Angelo Grotti.,Grotti
Hi.,Andy
Hello.,Dwight
"So, you got this table?",Grotti
Yes.,Michael
"This is one of those half booths, can't-decide-what-it-is type of thing.",Grotti
Well.,Michael
"Waitress, we're gonna sit over here.",Grotti
That's fine.,Waitress
Okay.,Michael
[answers phone] Hello.,Kevin
Hello Mr. Halpert. I'm calling from the identity theft department at Capital One. We've detected some unusual activity on your credit card.,Credit card rep
"Oh man, do you think it was stolen?",Kevin
First would you mind verifying your home address?,Rep
"Um, yes. [looks at Jim's pay stub] Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA",Kevin
And may I have the last four numbers of your Social Security Number?,Rep
Six-six-five-zero.,Kevin
Well Mr. Halpert. You're obviously not in San Juan Puerto Rico.,Rep
Wait a minute. Yes I am.,Kevin
I'm going to go ahead and put a hold on your card.,Rep
"No. That... I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.",Kevin
Very funny sir. We'll get a new card out to you right away.,Rep
No-,Kevin
"Have a nice day, and thank you!",Rep
Shoot.,Kevin
"If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that. If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better. Ah, you seem like a nice guy.",Grotti
Oh he's not that nice.,Dwight
That's not true.,Michael
Hmm. Very true.,Andy
Okay shut up.,Michael
Have you decided?,Waitress
"Yeah, I'll have the linguini, red sauce on the side. If the sauce does not come on the side, I will send it back. I want garlic bread, toasted, not burnt. If it comes burnt, I will send it back.",Grotti
Okay then. And for you sir?,Waitress
I will have the gabba-gool.,Michael
The... what?,Waitress
The gabba-gool.,Michael
I don't really know what that is.,Waitress
"[with Soprano's inflection] You know, gabba-gool.",Andy
"I don't, I don't have to have that.",Michael
"What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.",Dwight
"Guys, guys-",Michael
I don't really think that we have that.,Waitress
That's okay.,Michael
Bring him the gabba-gool!,Dwight
"Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.",Michael
Okay.,Waitress
"If the salad is on top, I send it back.",Michael
Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards?,Oscar
"I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.",Kevin
This constitutes identity fraud.,Oscar
Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.,Kevin
What's that supposed to mean?,Oscar
Oh you don't know about jail? Oh you would love jail.,Kevin
Why would I love jail?,Oscar
Because... You would love it.,Kevin
I don't think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.,Michael
Look closely Michael. I feel there's a plan here for you.,Grotti
Maybe we have a plan for you?,Andy
"How about you? Maybe you can use supplemental coverage of some kind. Anybody can get hurt! You always think, it can't happen to you, and [drops hand loudly on table] Think about it.",Grotti
[approaches with child] Excuse me. Sorry to bother you. Are you a mechanic?,Woman
Yeeeeah.,Andy
"My battery is dead, I've got my kid, can you please help?",Woman
Yes I can.,Andy
"No, no no, no. Come on. I'm sorry, we're having our salad.",Michael
Come on! Lady in distress? Go! Go!,Grotti
Okay!,Andy
"Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.",Woman
"Hey, do you need any help?",Michael
"I'm sure he can handle a simple jump-start. Now come on, sit down.",Grotti
He's a good mechanic.,Michael
Where were we?,Grotti
I don't...,Michael
He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.,Dwight
"Okay, okay okay.",Michael
So we're choosing...,Dwight
"Yep, all right.",Michael
Check out Dental?,Dwight
Put it down.,Michael
"Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down.",Andy
He seems bad at this.,Kid
"You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the... mechanic store. [Andy places connections wrong, smoke and explosion set off] Aaaah! You got a leaky spark tube.",Andy
What?!?,Woman
"So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles. [Andy walks away, woman is exasperated]",Andy
"Now if you could just sign this letter of intent, I'll bring this back to my boss, and we can get this in motion. [Andy clears throat loudly] You okay, Pat?",Grotti
"Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of.",Andy
Aren't you a mechanic? Why wouldn't you put oil in the car?,Grotti
"It was before, my tech- my technical training.",Andy
Don't do it!,Dwight
Do it.,Andy
Don't.,Dwight
Just do it.,Andy
Okay.,Michael
"Look Mike, I don't know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow?",Grotti
Yes.,Dwight
Okay.,Michael
"I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?",Dwight
It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.,Michael
"You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you.",Andy
I had to make a snap decision Dwight.,Michael
"It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.",Dwight
It was a lot of snap decisions.,Michael
Do you know what 'snap decision' means?,Dwight
Yes!,Michael
It means like this. [snaps fingers],Dwight
Just get in the car.,Michael
Hello?,Jim
Jim?,Michael
Michael?,Jim
Oh thank God.,Michael
"How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.",Jim
"It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.",Michael
That sounds bad.,Jim
"Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend.",Michael
I'm gonna help you through it all right?,Jim
Okay!,Michael
All you're gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and- it- and then go to--,Jim
Jim? Are you?,Michael
And then you'll be saved.,Jim
"What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said.",Michael
Just [drops] and then you'll be saved.,Jim
"No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!",Michael
A- ah--,Jim
No! Oh my God!,Michael
And you'll be saved.,Jim
"No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you!",Michael
I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An- M- please don't call again.,Jim
Jim?!? [dial tone] Oh my God.,Michael
"Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?",Michael
"Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.",Oscar
Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?,Michael
Just- no. No.,Oscar
"All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.",Michael
"We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.",Dwight
He's alive. So you're welcome.,Andy
"Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.",Dwight
"Yeah, some of that existed before.",Andy
"Not the living in fear, that's new.",Dwight
"You're right, that is new.",Andy
Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.,Dwight
Well I don't see that happening.,Andy
Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?,Dwight
Are you saying-,Andy
Yeah...,Dwight
That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?,Andy
What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!,Dwight
That seems a little far-fetched.,Andy
Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown? And that happened.,Dwight
Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.,Dwight
No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works.,Michael
"No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy. His background is perfectly clean.",Andy
"It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.",Dwight
Class act. Boy scout.,Andy
But Grotti acts like he's mafia though.,Michael
He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman.,Andy
And he made us all look like chumps!,Dwight
[grunts],Michael
"If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.",Michael
This is Grotti.,Grotti
This is Scott.,Michael
"Oh! Great. Michael, I'm finishing up your paperwork right now.",Grotti
Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?,Michael
"I, I thought you'd be pleased.",Grotti
Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.,Michael
What?,Grotti
"I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.",Michael
I don't get it. How was I scaring you?,Grotti
I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.,Michael
Whoa. Okay.,Andy
You suck!,Michael
Okay that's-,Dwight
And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance.,Michael
"That's good, let's wrap it up.",Dwight
"How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?",Michael
"Look, Michael, when we all calm down here, maybe at some point in the future, you change your mind, why don't you give me a call?",Grotti
Doubt it. [disconnects call],Michael
[relaxing] Oh man.,Dwight and Andy
What a tool. [Dwight and Andy exchange looks] What?,Michael
"Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!",Andy
No. What do you mean?,Michael
"We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.",Dwight
What?,Michael
You successfully backed down the mob!,Dwight
You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!,Andy
Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not.,Michael
"So I looked him in the eye and I said, 'Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they're already dead.' I said something like that.",Michael
Very close.,Dwight
"Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.",Oscar
Erin?,Michael
Yes?,Erin
Coffee?,Michael
Okay.,Erin
"Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it's not Stop and Shop, I send it back.",Michael
Okay.,Erin
Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.,Michael
How do you return coffee?,Erin
Go. Any questions?,Michael
[on phone] Are you kidding me?,Pam
"Hi Pam, is Jim there?",Kevin
"Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here!",Pam
"Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.",Kevin
Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.,Pam
Cool. Okay. [Pam hangs up] Bye.,Kevin
They have no idea what happened.,Kevin
They're back!,Erin
Oooh yeah... [people chuckle] Jim and Pam!,Kevin
How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?,Kelly
It was.,Jim
It really was.,Pam
Really was.,Jim
[voice cracks] I'm so happy for you...,Kelly
Puerto Rico was awesome.,Jim
"Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.",Pam
[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.,Jim
[goofy voice] Frank and beans!,Pam
"Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?",Michael
Yeah!,Dwight
Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind.,Michael
"Its Jim and Pam, Michael.",Dwight
[gasps] It is?,Michael
Yeah...,Dwight
"They're back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam! [reaching out with hands at chest level]",Michael
Nope.,Jim
"And oh, Jim...",Michael
"Hi, Michael.",Pam
"Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.",Michael
Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him. [groans],Michael
So what'd you bring us?,Meredith
Some candy.,Pam
What else?,Meredith
That's it.,Pam
"Oh, 'cause you spent so much on the wedding.",Meredith
"[behind Pam, acting out blind-guy, groaning]",Michael
It's good to be home.,Pam
This conversation has two items on the agenda.,Dwight
Do we have a conversation scheduled?,Jim
"Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations!",Dwight
"Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.",Jim
"[duck voice] You're welcome! [quacks, laughs]",Dwight
"I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.",Dwight
I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.,Dwight
It's a real handsome duck.,Jim
"Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair.",Dwight
Hey!,Pam
Hi!,Erin
"Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.",Pam
Coco Leche! That's my favorite!,Erin
Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.,Pam
"Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.",Erin
[laughs] I think it'll be okay.,Pam
"[laughs] I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though.",Erin
Great.,Pam
"Oops, sorry. [slides candy back to Pam] Oops.",Erin
I have recently taken a lover.,Michael
"Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?",Jim
Pam's mom.,Michael
What?,Jim
"Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?",Michael
You're messing with me.,Jim
About what?,Michael
You did not have sex with Pam's mom.,Jim
"Oh, big time.",Michael
What kind of car does she drive?,Jim
She drives a green camry.,Michael
[expletive],Jim
And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.,Michael
Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.,Jim
[laughs] What?,Michael
"Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-",Jim
"Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?",Michael
Oh my God.,Jim
"[walks in] Hey, Jim.",Toby
"Not now, Toby, my God!",Jim
"Oh, Jesus!",Toby
"Get the hell out of here, idiot.",Michael
What did I do?,Toby
"Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.",Jim
"I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.",Michael
"No, not more than anything.",Jim
"Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-",Michael
Don't call her 'the mom.',Jim
She's right on my way home from work.,Michael
"Then take a different way home, man!",Jim
"I di- alright, I'll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.",Michael
"Okay, so we're good.",Jim
Yeah.,Michael
Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?,Michael
"Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?",Erin
Sure. Thanks for asking.,Michael
"Pam, we're all set. [Pam places candy on Erin's desk] Yum.",Erin
Frank and beans!,Jim
"Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?",Pam
You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?,Jim
"Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we?",Pam
"You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.",Jim
"Come on, it'll take two seconds.",Pam
"No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]",Jim
"[unwraps rum gift] Oh, wow.",Michael
[giggles],Pam
That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican.,Michael
"Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people.",Erin
"Erin, look. [holds up parrot rum bottle]",Michael
Fun!,Erin
Yeah.,Michael
"Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion.",Pam
"Yeah, no, it's nobody.",Michael
[laughs] I don't know. I think Michael has a date.,Pam
[chuckles] Hmm... no.,Michael
[laughs] I think you have a date.,Pam
I don't.,Michael
Come on.,Pam
"Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.",Jim
"[sighs] I don't deserve this, guys.",Michael
"Yes, you do.",Jim
"No, I don't.",Michael
Just take the parrot.,Jim
[long exhale],Michael
"Okay, back to the old grind.",Jim
I was probably going to break up with her anyway.,Michael
"Oh, that's too bad.",Pam
Don't-,Jim
"Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here.",Michael
Sounds complicated.,Jim
It is.,Michael
"Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.",Pam
You want me to be happy?,Michael
Of course.,Pam
"Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.",Michael
Oh.,Pam
"More than a friend, a co-worker.",Michael
"Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who?",Pam
It's okay.,Michael
"No, no, no, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!",Pam
"That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset.",Michael
"[screams out in the parking lot, Michael watches from his office window]",Pam
"[to Michael] You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?",Dwight
Okay.,Michael
"There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down...",Dwight
[sighs] Feels good.,Michael
There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...,Dwight
"I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner.",Michael
"...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.",Dwight
"[outside, on cell phone] How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!",Pam
[singsong voice] Who wants a hot chocolate?,Jim
Thank you.,Pam
"[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.",Jim
You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.,Pam
"Andy, can I talk to you for a second?",Jim
"Sure thing, Tuna Boss.",Andy
"[holding up a sign that reads, 'Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office']",Jim
[in Jim's office] How may I be of service to you?,Andy
"I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?",Jim
"[both look at Dwight, Jim waves] This aurea is a joke.",Andy
Really?,Jim
What are you thinking?,Andy
I was gonna go with this one.,Jim
"[both look at Dwight who is standing right outside the office] Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.",Andy
[Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog... what was that all about?,Dwight
"I know, right?",Andy
What were you talking about in there?,Dwight
"Trust me it would only make you mad. [opera continues, Dwight looks at Jim standing outside his office, waves, Jim waves back]",Andy
"[in the conference room leading a meeting] Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.",Michael
Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?,Andy
"That was a hit job. If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster. So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.",Michael
Haha! Ha ha ha.,Pam
And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice. [everyone claps and makes comments],Jim
"Who wants to help the world one step at a time? [Dwight raises his hand] Alright, good.",Michael
Volunteerism is important. Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there. Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.,Dwight
"Alright, that's...",Michael
Paint a mural of Chicano leaders.,Meredith
Alright...,Michael
"I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it. [laughter]",Pam
"Okay, I'm out of here, [pretends to leave] see you later guys...",Michael
"Get out and stay out, bye...",Various
"Ok, oh no here's an idea... conservation...",Michael
"I love it, conservation. Let's start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings. [stands up and cheers] No more meetings! No more meetings! No more meetings! No more meetings! [Stanley cheers her on in the background]",Pam
Anybody else? Who else has an idea?,Michael
I have some ideas about conservation...,Angela
Yes! Angela! Please...,Jim
[Michael leaves to answer his phone] Can you hold down the fort? [on phone] Hey boo!,Michael
Thank you. Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...,Angela
[on phone] What's it... why are you crying?,Michael
Yes! I think we should look into that. If you could just speak up louder...,Jim
[to Angela] Shhhh...,Kevin
"Well, for our profit...",Angela
[to Angela] Shhh...,Kevin
"[on phone] No, no, no, I'll talk to her. I will... No... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, I'll let you know how it goes. Alright, by pickle.",Michael
Who's pickle?,Kevin
"[hangs up phone and walks back into conference room] Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.",Michael
"I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor.",Angela
Yes.,Jim
"Hold on, hold on, what's going on?",Oscar
Nothing... nothing at all... it's all good!,Jim
I'm not apologizing to anyone. Michael owes me an apology.,Pam
For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?,Michael
Don't call my mother your lover.,Pam
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.,Kevin
That is not okay dude.,Andy
"Alright, in my defense...",Michael
Disgusting...,Phyllis
She's messed up man...,Creed
"Yes! Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!",Pam
You have no sense of boundaries Michael.,Oscar
"Shut up Oscar. Hey, alright, you know what, clearly I'm outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please? What is so wrong about me? I'm caring, I'm generous, I'm sensual. Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness.",Michael
"Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.",Phyllis
"Maybe you're right, who are we to...",Oscar
"Shut up Oscar. What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!",Pam
I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.,Dwight
Let's get back to the matter at hand.,Michael
"Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody's mom...",Pam
"No, no, no... no, no...",Michael
"Whoa, that's my mother you're talking about...",Ryan
"I don't like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.",Michael
"Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous!",Pam
"Do not talk to me that way! I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out.",Michael
"You are never going to be my father, you get out!",Pam
"I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am...",Michael
Me too...,Pam
Hey. [walks up to Oscar and hands him a report to sign],Pam
Hey.,Oscar
"[in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how's your day going?",Angela
"Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions.",Oscar
"Oh, well, thanks Oscar. I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?",Pam
My mother's in a wheelchair.,Oscar
"Well, he could still... I'm sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.",Pam
"[Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question. Do you think that I should get a Fedora?",Kelly
"Ahh, I don't think so, no...",Ryan
"Well, I think I'd look really hot in one. Where'd you get your fedora?",Kelly
I'd rather not say.,Ryan
I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you.,Kelly
Hi Dwight!,Erin
[Dwight storms through the break room listening to Kelly and Ryan in his ear piece] Shh!,Dwight
[Ryan and Kelly talking] ...it should go with the persona you already have.,Ryan
"Well, I think I have that persona.",Kelly
Where did you get that mallard?,Dwight
What the hell is a mallard?,Kelly
That!,Dwight
"Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.",Kelly
"Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back.",Dwight
"If you take it back, I'll scream.",Kelly
[sighs heavily] I'll give you five bucks for it.,Dwight
Twenty.,Ryan
Ten.,Dwight
Deal. [pays Ryan and takes the mallard back],Ryan
[to Ryan] You're so cool.,Kelly
"This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.",Ryan
"[walks into Toby's office] Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute?",Michael
"Yeah, sure, what's up?",Toby
"Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I'm sorry.",Michael
"Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot. Thank you for saying it.",Toby
Can I sit down for a second?,Michael
"Yeah, er... pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.",Toby
"This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation.",Michael
"Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.",Toby
She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.,Michael
"Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.",Toby
Really? Would you do that?,Michael
Yeah... that's why they pay me the big bucks. [both laugh],Toby
"[hugs Toby, who smiles big] You're a good, good guy.",Michael
I'm good...,Toby
"You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we'd become friends.",Toby
"[walks up to Pam's desk with a binder] Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?",Toby
"Sure, what's up?",Pam
"Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.",Toby
"[to Michael] What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles?",Pam
No... that's...,Michael
Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know...,Toby
"[to Michael] Oh, would that make you feel better?",Pam
I don't... um... I can't hear your conversation.,Michael
You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving.,Pam
"[gets up and puts a hand on Michael's shoulder] Buddy, I think that...",Toby
"Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you're a jackass. [to Pam] Hey, hey, you know what? You're just as stubborn as your mother, when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it.",Michael
"Heh, heh, heh.",Stanley
"Michael, you're just her rebound!",Pam
"You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.",Michael
[to Jim] What! You knew?,Pam
"Barely, I... I don't have all the facts. Frank and Bean...",Jim
"[Pam storms into break room] Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom? Is that how we're gonna get past this? Cause, I will.",Michael
"Mmmmm, yes!",Pam
"Well, that is not gonna happen!",Michael
Then why'd you even offer!?,Pam
Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.,Michael
"Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh[beep] about your happiness! Stop dating my mother!",Pam
You know what? I'm gonna start dating her even harder.,Michael
What's that supposed to mean?,Pam
You know what it means.,Michael
[Pam storms out of the break room] Hey...,Jim
Shut it!,Pam
Yep...,Jim
"I don't need to be friends with Pam. I have plenty of female friends. My mom, Pam's mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on IM, what's her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week.",Michael
"[walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back.",Jim
"Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even...",Dwight
[speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy.,Jim
[walks into Jim's office and takes out ear piece] I'm sorry.,Dwight
A wooden duck?,Jim
Mallard. I put it in your office in order to surveil you. I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.,Dwight
"Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage...",Jim
"Oh, I'm equipped... I can...",Dwight
Silence.,Jim
Don't tell Michael...,Dwight
"I won't. But, you will wash and buff our car.",Jim
"Punishment fits the crime, I accept. [shakes Jim's hand and leaves]",Dwight
"[leaving his office with his rum] Night everyone. Night Pam, thanks again for the rum.",Michael
Night Michael.,Erin
Night Erin.,Michael
"[in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second? So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day. So he generously offered to wash our car.",Jim
"[looking out the window at Dwight washing the car] Awww, he did that for me?",Pam
"Yes, he did. You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.",Jim
Mmmm.,Pam
[Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?,Jim
"Haha, yeah. Say more nice things.",Pam
"Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!",Jim
Maybe I'm overreacting.,Pam
Yeah... maybe.,Jim
But I don't think I am.,Pam
"You're not, nope. Nope.",Jim
[Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh... where'd you get that hat?,Kevin
I'd rather not say.,Ryan
"[walks into Jims office, twists the top of the pen that he placed in Jim's pen holder which has a bug in it, pushes play] [Jim's voice] 'We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our...' [pauses recording] I've got eight hours of this. Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe. Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard? I'm not insane. [starts the recording again] '...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer.'",Dwight
Welcome children of the Scranton Industrial Park Community.,Michael
YAY!,Kids
Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha... [bumps into something] ... ha ha ha.,Michael
"We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.",Jim
I am going to scare these kids so bad.,Michael
"This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. [Kevin chops into Erin, who is dressed as Princess Fiona] Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.",Darryl
Black widow.,Angela
Lulu from The Fifth Element.,Kelly
"Nobody told me what people were, alright? So... label yourselves or take what you get.",Darryl
I want to sell your blood!,Creed
That's really not the trend in vampires right now.,Ryan
Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.,Darryl
I'm a hobo.,Meredith
"I asked for a list. [Dwight rides in on a tricycle, laughing diabolically] ...and a clown.",Darryl
"I'm Jigsaw, idiot.",Dwight
"You're not as scary as Book Face, over there.",Darryl
Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.,Jim
"Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!",Darryl
"Yeah! [a chair falls over, Michael is seen hanging from the ceiling with a noose around his neck - the kids scream]",Kids
"Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?",Michael
Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message?,Michael
It is the easy way out. You are not alone.,Michael
What the hell is wrong with you?,Darryl
Who wants candy?,Michael
...and then I think I'm going to go to the Garlic Festival.,Michael
Wow.,Jim
Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.,Michael
I bet we would.,Jim
They have a TCBY booth.,Michael
Cool.,Jim
The same stuff you get downtown.,Michael
Mmm-hmm.,Jim
Do you like TCBY?,Michael
Who doesn't?,Jim
I can't believe it's- I can't believe it's yogurt. Uh... it'll be fun,Michael
I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour.,Erin
"Oh. Actually, it's just gonna be me.",Jim
They said the both of you.,Erin
That is a mistake.,Jim
You should give them a call. Check that out.,Michael
"Alright. Let's clear this up. [on phone] Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?",Jim
"Jim's a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?",Michael
Great. See ya' then.,Jim
Wha- what?,Michael
They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.,Jim
"Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand.",Michael
"I absolutely don't understand, either.",Jim
"I don't want you to feel like I'm baby-sitting you, or something. Alright.",Michael
Alright.,Jim
Let me get your stroller.,Michael
"Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?",Jim
What are you gonna call him?,Michael
Dave.,Jim
No. What is his name?,Michael
Dave.,Jim
Mr. Bourchard. They're very formal.,Michael
Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.,Jim
"Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?",Michael
"Yes, it is.",Jim
...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.,Michael
No thanks.,Jim
They are into style.,Michael
Mmm-hmm.,Jim
They are into appearance. We are selling success.,Michael
...and paper.,Jim
That's sorta secondary. [offers Jim the watch again],Michael
Nope. No.,Jim
He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.,Jim
Here we are outside-,Pam

- the Wilkes-Barre Industrial Park.,Pam
Industrial P.! Makin' cold calls.,Andy
The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.,Pam
[singing] Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.,Andy
Here it is. [Andy is still singing] Suite 401.,Pam
Yeah. I was gonna sing that part.,Andy
I know. Now you don't have to.,Pam
"Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling. [sings] Suite 401.",Andy
Alright. Hi. Any messages?,Michael
You're soaking wet.,Erin
"Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.",Michael
Wow. Sounds scary.,Phyllis
It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't.,Michael
Why isn't Jim wet?,Angela
I outran it.,Jim
I don't think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.,Meredith
It rained.,Michael
"Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?",Dwight
Nothing. Cocoa.,Michael
I'll just leave that suit in your office then.,Jim
Good. Yep.,Michael
Must be nice to have company on these cold calls.,Secretary
We're kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio. [points to Pam's tummy],Andy
How exciting! Do you guys know the sex yet?,Secretary
"[Andy shakes his head 'no'] Oh. No, no. [laughing] We're not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together.",Pam
[miffed] Looks like somebody's got a case of the definitelies.,Andy
"[Michael is walking around in one of Jim's suits] Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.",Erin
Ok. Thank you.,Michael
Did you say 'Koi pond'?,Stanley
[phone rings] Yeah?,Michael
"Michael, people are asking questions.",Erin
"Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what's going on?",Michael
"Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?",Phyllis
Uh... I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.,Michael
"Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?",Oscar
Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.,Jim
It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.,Michael
So you fell in?,Angela
No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.,Michael
So a child had fallen in?,Angela
Not yet!,Michael
That is hilarious. [extends hand for a fist bump],Kevin
"No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying. [Stanley laughs]",Michael
"Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.",Jim
And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.,Pam
Well that sounds like a really nice deal.,Customer
Sha-bow.,Andy
"And I must say, that since we are a family business it is nice to see that you are, too.",Customer
"Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not.",Andy
My mistake. Sorry.,Customer
It's ok.,Pam
"Nuh. Actually, it's kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh... a nine.",Andy
That- that's good for you.,Customer
"Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.",Pam
"Pam's carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam. Doesn't matter what Pam looks like.",Andy
Yeah.,Pam
You were way meaner to me than I was to you.,Pam
No I wasn't. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.,Andy
"You blew the sale, you idiot.",Pam
Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.,Andy
"Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?",Michael
"Staples? [Kevin clears his throat] Uh, David Wallace called.",Erin
Oh. He did? What did he say?,Michael
"He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.",Erin
Ok.,Michael
[whispers to Erin] I'm gonna kill you.,Kevin
"Michael, don't listen to them.",Stanley
"Thank you, Stanley.",Michael
You just ignore their carp.,Stanley
Ok.,Michael
Michael?,Dwight
Yes.,Michael
A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.,Dwight
"Hey, boss, did you find Nemo?",Creed
"I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story.",Michael
Don't you mean 'Koi Story'?,Oscar
"And when you fell in, did you flounder?",Phyllis
"Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -",Dwight
I know what a flounder is.,Michael
I'm not usually the butt of the joke. I'm usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and he'd have to put on my suit and it'd be too short and he'd look... Damn it! He'd still look good.,Michael
The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been 'Koi-ponded'? Who here's been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis?,Michael
"Michael, you make fun of us every day.",Phyllis
Uh...,Michael
Yeah. Every single day.,Kevin
You never said anything.,Michael
"Uh, we have. Countless times.",Meredith
"Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'Stop because I want you to stop' or STOP as in 'Stop. You're making me laugh so hard. What you're doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!'",Michael
That's never the case.,Angela
"We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right? [writes 'Koi pond' on the list] Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.",Michael
I don't want people making fun of my nose.,Dwight
Your nose?,Michael
It's too small.,Dwight
Alright.,Michael
Oh my. That is small.,Oscar
"Just, write it down, please.",Dwight
Can you breathe okay?,Oscar
What keeps your glasses on?,Kelly
"Hey! It's on the list, everybody.",Dwight
No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance.,Michael
I don't want people making fun of my weight.,Kevin
Ok. That's to broad. It's gotta be something else. How 'bout your stomach? Yeah? [writes Huge Gut] Meredith?,Michael
I don't want to say it out loud.,Meredith
Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.,Michael
I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do? [she writes 'sex with a terrorist'],Meredith
Ok.,Michael
That is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it.,Andy
"Well, you two are quite the salesmen and a very cute couple.",Keena Gifford
Well-,Andy
Oh- [both look at each other and together say] Thank you.,Pam
Some couples don't seem like a good match. You two do.,Keena Gifford
"Well, you know.",Pam
Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook-,Andy
He loves to eat.,Pam
I love to dance-,Andy
I love to watch him dance.,Pam
Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room-,Andy
And I'll just watch him.,Pam
And a baby on the way? You must be so excited.,Keena Gifford
Yes.,Pam
Yeah. We are thrilled.,Andy
Mmm-hmm.,Pam
"In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey?",Andy
"It was, sweetie.",Pam
Oh. I know the best teacher. Her name is Miss Janet.,Keena Gifford
Yeah. On Clearview Avenue.,Andy
Yeah!,Keena Gifford
Yeah.,Andy
"This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.",Angela
"So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?",Phyllis
"Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died. [everyone shows remorse]",Erin
It's a fish.,Michael
They want you to pay for it.,Erin
It could've died of natural causes. So...,Michael
"Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.",Erin
When is the funeral?,Oscar
"Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?",Michael
$300.00 ,Erin
What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.,Michael
"Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy?",Creed
"Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it.",Jim
"No, no.",Michael
Thank you. [everyone begins to leave],Dwight
No. We are not done here. This-,Michael
"One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!",Andy
That's great!,Keena Gifford
"Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me.",Andy
"Yeah, well, that'll happen.",Pam
"Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too. [leans over and kisses Pam's belly]",Andy
Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.,Pam
"Message received, little soy bean.",Andy
"I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.",Jim
"No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'.",Michael
"No, they don't.",Jim
"Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.",Michael
Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.,Jim
I want to make fun of you right now.,Michael
"Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.",Jim
No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid.,Michael
See?,Jim
"Oh, my God.",Michael
"Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much? [everyone starts laughing] Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to.",Michael
"Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?",Phyllis
"Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem.",Michael
"Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.",Dwight
"It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing. [Jim signals for making to stop] No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse. [Michael begins to lose his cool] Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think. [realizing he's going downhill] Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'. Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.",Michael
[watching Angela eat something] Enjoying your nut?,Kevin
Kevin.,Oscar
Why?,Angela
I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.,Kevin
I was.,Angela
Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over.,Michael
"Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...",Jim
We'll stay late.,Kevin
"Well, that went pretty well.",Andy
"Yeah, I guess.",Pam
"We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I'd say we nailed it.",Andy
"If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss.",Pam
You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.,Andy
Yeah. Way too much.,Pam
Yeah.,Andy
"I mean, what the hell was that?",Pam
What the heck was that?,Andy
When you cried?,Pam
"Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.",Andy
You're fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?,Pam
"No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don't know. It was fun to role play, right?",Andy
Hmm.,Pam
"I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single.",Andy
"Well, are you dating anyone?",Pam
What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool.,Andy
Ah.,Pam
You think I can do better?,Andy
Ah.,Pam
Gotta get my goin' out on.,Andy
"Hey, let's watch this thing.",Meredith
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.",Jim
How can we not watch this?,Oscar
What happened to 'Do Not Mock'?,Jim
"We're not mocking, we're watching.",Phyllis
That will inevitably lead to mocking. So...,Jim
"Well, we'll deal with it as it comes.",Phyllis
Is this the tape of me falling?,Michael
Yes. Put the DVD in.,Phyllis
Open QuickTime.,Kevin
It starts on it's own. Let it -,Oscar
No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this.,Kevin
Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.,Jim
No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't fire all of you.,Michael
What are you doing?,Jim
It's alright. I can handle it.,Michael
No.,Jim
"I am a grown-up, Jim.",Michael
Shh. It's on.,Meredith
Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom!,Kevin
Oh. Did - did you see that?,Oscar
See what?,Jim
Why'd you stop it?,Angela
"Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.",Jim
"Jim, you let Michael fall in.",Oscar
Play it again. [everyone has the same reaction as before] He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.,Dwight
Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.,Jim
I don't think you froze.,Michael
It's a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?,Jim
No.,Angela
I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away],Jim
Judas.,Dwight
"Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-",Dwight
"I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.",Jim
Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.,Michael
"[as Jim enters the kitchen] Hey, what's up lifeguard?",Meredith
"Jim, I think I'm in your way. [leans back - they both exit]",Oscar
Oscar's a douche.,Michael
[laughing] He's alright.,Jim
"No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok. [holds door open as they exit]",Michael
Thanks Michael.,Jim
You're welcome. Whoa! [leans back] Almost fell. [they both laugh],Michael
"Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?",Pam
"Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them.",Erin
Ok.,Pam
Thanks.,Erin
Mmm-hmm.,Pam
"How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?",Erin
"No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool.",Pam
"Yeah, he is!",Erin
"Yeah, he is.",Pam
"He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met.",Erin
That's... right. He's like Marlon Brando.,Pam
Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.,Erin
I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah.,Pam
Good morning everybody. Who would like an authentic New York bagel? Hmmm? Stanley?,Dwight
Thank you. [reaches for bagel],Stanley
"No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.",Dwight
Wow. H & H. You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?,Andy
"Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?",Dwight
"This is really nice Dwight, thanks.",Phyllis
Thanks.,Andy
"Oh, don't mention it. You owe me one. You all owe me one.",Dwight
Good morning Michael.,Dwight
Morning Dwight.,Michael
Hungry?,Dwight
No. I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't want hers. Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.,Michael
Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.,Dwight
"Well, yeah...",Michael
You're thinking of deer penis.,Dwight
It worked.,Michael
Regardless. That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry. [holds up tray] Bagel?,Dwight
I don't mind if I do.,Michael
K. I brought cheese too.,Dwight
I'm taking one for my lady friend.,Michael
Excellent.,Dwight
Brain food. Thank you very much.,Michael
Okay. [walks out of Michael's office] You owe me.,Dwight
Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore? Geez. When did everyone get so cynical?,Dwight
"Pam, would you care for a bagel?",Dwight
"Oh, no thank you.",Pam
"That's right. You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time. I'll try again. Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.",Dwight
I have an early lunch.,Pam
"Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom. I don't know. I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go. No way out. No way out.",Pam
These are amazing. You took all these?,Erin
I've always found beauty in uncommon places. Homeless people. Graffiti. Photography lets me capture all that. Have you ever been photographed before?,Ryan
Oh just by like friends.,Erin
Well here's what I've been doing around here. It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.,Ryan
[walks into the office] Whoohoo! Pammy?,Helene
Hey! [gets up to greet Helene] Hey. Happy birthday.,Pam
Thank you. [they hug],Helene
[comes over to hug them both] My girls. There they are. [Pam walks away],Michael
"Birthday lunch. Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch. It'll cure all of your 'Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother' and fixes all occurrences of 'I don't really see them together'. So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine. Take with food.",Michael
"Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?",Angela
I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.,Pam
Yeah--,Michael
Hi.,Kevin
I think everyone has meet Helene. Shall we?,Michael
Wait a minute. [looks at the bag in Michael's hand] Is that another birthday present for me cause you already gave me a necklace.,Helene
Oh my God I love it. [looks at camera and shakes head],Kelly
Tell her how you gave it to me.,Helene
"No, that wouldn't be--",Michael
He put it around my neck while I was still asleep this morning. What a nice way to wake up.,Helene
Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.,Michael
Because of sex?,Kevin
Hey--,Michael
Kevin!,Pam
"Please, Kevin. You're fired. [Kevin looks at Jim; Jim shakes his head] Sorry, sorry. Work with a bunch of idiots. Shall we go?",Michael
"Yes, let's go. [looks at Erin and nods]",Pam
"Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent.",Erin
"Oh, you guys. Just one second. [picks up phone] Oh my gosh! Are you serious? Shipping emergency. I don't think I can go to lunch.",Pam
"Oh man, that's crazy. Right as we were on our way out too.",Jim
I know. Isn't that always how it goes?,Pam
Rarely. If ever. Let me give it a whirl. I'll talk to them.,Jim
I want to handle it.,Pam
That's okay.,Jim
I feel like its--,Pam
It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello? Well that's great. [hangs up phone] Turns out the paper was there all along.,Jim
[sighs] Thank God.,Creed
Something's up. That paper was never supposed to arrive.,Creed
"So, Pammy-- are you still liking sales?",Helene
Yeah-- it's exciting.,Pam
"Well, you know-- Michael and I were-- talking, and maybe if you put a little more face to face time with your clients you could improve your sales.",Helene
Pam's sales are fine actually.,Jim
"Just want you to succeed Pammy. You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today.",Michael
Thank you.,Pam
Today is about family.,Michael
Why did I get in the car? I could of struggled. I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.,Pam
"Oh, Dwight. I have a little surprise for you.",Andy
Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.,Dwight
"Yes! [they laugh] And I wanted to return the favor. I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory.",Andy
Wow--,Dwight
Feel it against your cheek.,Andy
I will. [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight's face],Dwight
You give me a gift-- Bam! Thank you note. You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP. You do me a favor-- Wham! Favor returned. Do not test my politeness.,Andy
Let me get that door for you-- [runs to open door],Dwight
Whoa--,Andy
There you go!,Dwight
Thank you very much. Now I've got it for you. [holds open door],Andy
"Oh... goodness... thanks. You know, here's a healthy fitness tip. If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.",Dwight
Is that right?,Andy
Observe. [walks towards desk],Dwight
Huh. [laughs; follows Dwight],Andy
Right?,Dwight
That really works.,Andy
"Yeah, feel free to use that. Anytime. Okay.",Dwight
"Hey-- oh, hold on a second. Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.",Andy
[straightens Andy's tie] And that needs to be straight as an arrow.,Dwight
Whoa-- thank you very much. [takes off Dwight's glasses and blows on them] Oh boy.,Andy
Thank you very much for that.,Dwight
[puts Dwight's glasses back on Dwight's face] You are very welcome.,Andy
[pulls out Andy's chair] Have a seat. Allow me.,Dwight
[pulls out Dwight's chair] Have a seat yourself.,Andy
You know what? I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.,Dwight
Not necessary.,Andy
"No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away]",Dwight
You didn't have to do that.,Andy
Andy is complicating things. But I'm not worried. This will only up my game.,Dwight
Hello. Scott. Table for four.,Michael
Welcome Scott family. It'll be just a moment.,Hostess
"I use to love coming here. The chicken parm is good. Big part of my childhood. Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.",Pam
What table should we take? So many to choose from.,Michael
Wow.,Jim
[sees table decorated with a banner and balloons] Oh my God!,Helene
"What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations. Oh, wait a second! You mean this one? Wow!",Michael
"Michael, you did all this?",Pam
Not about taking credit. Let's just say we all did it.,Michael
"Well, thank you. All of you.",Helene
"Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place. Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.",Michael
Oh you'll love it. You can have my guide books. I think I'm done with those really long plane rides.,Helene
Oh. Thank you. Thanks for lending me the books.,Michael
"So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?",Pam
[laughs] Sticking with 49.,Helene
49 again? That's nine years in a row. This is now our longest family tradition.,Pam
That's funny.,Michael
"Well, as long as you're running numbers Pam, then help me out with this one. Let's see your six months pregnant, but you've only been married for 30 days, so what does that add up to?",Helene
"Oh, burn. Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]",Jim
You're 54 years old.,Michael
No. I'm 58.,Helene
You're 58 years old?,Michael
Uh huh.,Helene
Congratulations.,Michael
The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle. If anything I am robbing the grave.,Michael
"Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?",Pam
"Oh, well I like Nana, but I also like the classic Grandma.",Helene
Please be Grandma.,Pam
Definitely Grandma.,Jim
I want you to be Grandma.,Pam
"Oh, Michael what do you think? Grandma?",Helene
[nods uncomfortably] That--,Michael
"Yay, Grandma!",Pam
"Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?",Michael
Maybe.,Pam
Helene?,Michael
"Oh, oh no. I don't think so.",Helene
"I am. I'm definitely going to do it. I've already got the run and the bike thing down. Just need to learn how to swim. Come on, you in?",Michael
"Oh no, I think a triathlon is pretty much something I can rule out. It just-- doesn't interest me.",Helene
"So it's a matter of interest. Good, okay. It's not anything you would have ever done.",Michael
"Hmm... I might have done it when I was younger, but now there's just other things I'd rather be doing, instead of running and jumping and swimming--",Helene
Well there's no jumping in a triathlon.,Michael
Oh--,Helene
You're thinking of the broad jump. Would you try-- bungee jumping?,Michael
"No, no... [laughs]",Helene
Snowboarding?,Michael
You want to go snowboarding?,Helene
I might.,Michael
"Michael, what are you talking about?",Helene
[sighs] Nothing. Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.,Michael
Do I really want to go snowboarding? No. But I would like to if I wanted to.,Michael
[singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food],Andy
What's going on in here?,Dwight
Andy bought lunch.,Oscar
Oh... no... really?,Dwight
"Yep, yep. Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.",Andy
There is no book. There's only a survival guide.,Dwight
"You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.",Andy
"Okay, well, allow me. You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make. I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!",Dwight
So we should get the check?,Michael
What about your gift Michael?,Pam
"Oh, no, no, no. No. It's stupid. You'd hate it. I hate it.",Michael
I'm sure I won't.,Helene
Yes you will.,Michael
He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.,Pam
Gimme. Look at this wrapping paper. It's got the word love on it in every language.,Helene
Aww--,Pam
I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all. Might as well of been toilet paper.,Michael
"[opens present, reads inscription] A scrapbook of our first memories by Michael Gary Scott. For my girlfriend Helene on your birthday. [laughs]",Helene
That's just an arbitrary title.,Michael
"Ok, there's a penny. What's that from?",Helene
Penny for your thoughts.,Jim
"It was from the wishing well at the mall. You threw it in. I went back later, waded in and I found it.",Helene
Wow.,Jim
That's amazing.,Pam
"It's not amazing... at all. It's sort of weird that I went and did that. And now your wish won't come true, so that blows.",Michael
[looking through the book] A poem!,Helene
Oh that I plagiarized I think.,Michael
[reading] I can not go to school today said little Peggy Ann McKay...,Helene
[whispers to Pam] Shel Silverstein.,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
"Um-- I have the measles and the mumps, a gash, a rash and purple bumps. And my teachers really mean-- Happy Birthday , I love you Helene.",Helene
That's really nice Michael.,Pam
I think it sucks.,Michel
"I think it's wonderful, absolutely wonderful.",Helene
"Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things. It's a generational-- sort of gap between us.",Michael
[hugging book] God... it's a scrapbook.,Helene
Home run Michael.,Pam
You set the bar so high.,Jim
That was a bunt.,Michael
"Whoa, whoa Dwight. I'm going to do this.",Andy
"Hey, hey, hey-- relax I got it covered.",Dwight
"No, I insist.",Andy
"No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist. [pushes Andy out of the room and locks the door]",Dwight
"Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous.",Andy
Don't worry about it. You can just owe me.,Dwight
Hey. Where'd you go?,Pam
"Oh, just went to the bathroom.",Michael
And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?,Pam
I got thirsty.,Michael
"Okay, weirdo. Come on. It's time for cake.",Pam
"Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly. And then I met Helene. And she is great and she already knows and has done everything that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it. But, I think I want to do those things myself.",Michael
Cakes really good.,Pam
"Oh, I know. I love how they use butter cream frosting.",Helene
"Finish your cake, Helene.",Michael
Hmmm?,Helene
"I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible I need to tell you. I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.",Michael
"Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much. But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.",Michael
"Michael. Michael ,it's okay.",Pam
No it's not.,Michael
"I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy. And that makes me happy.",Pam
Wow. That just-- you've really grown.,Michael
Well--,Pam
"[covering eyes] Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part. Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it. And I want it someday, but just in the future. You need somebody who-- who understands your references. Who is Kafkaesque? I've never-- I don't know him. There's another woman. And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.",Michael
"Okay, so--",Jim
"And I want kids. And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.",Michael
Michael.,Pam
It's not my decision. It's mother nature. And mother has very strict rules about fer-- [waitress comes over to pour water; long pause] -- tility.,Michael
"I, um-- I got it.",Helene
I'm 58. What am I supposed to do now?,Helene
"Well, hobbies--",Michael
Stop.,Jim
[reaching for something on the top shelf] Ahh.,Andy
What's going on?,Dwight
Stupid things wedged up there. No one in this office will help me.,Andy
"Alright, move it.",Dwight
What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something? That is a recipe for a ghost.,Andy
"Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.",Dwight
It's like a little envelope-- there you go.,Andy
Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha-- [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.,Dwight
Surprise! [laughs] It's from everybody. $15 value.,Andy
Dammit. I am no closer to taking Jim down. What a waste of a day. I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. [bends over and hold hand about 1/2 an inch from the floor] They're mushrooms. They don't get that high.,Dwight
Pamela Beesly Halpert--,Michael
What?,Pam
May I have a word with you in my office please?,Michael
I am working.,Pam
"Well, this is a work related matter.",Michael
Really?,Pam
Yes.,Michael
Really?,Pam
"Yes. Join me please, won't you? [Pam gets up and follows Michael into his office] I am going to give you a raise.",Michael
Why?,Pam
Because of all the good work you've done.,Michael
I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.,Pam
"That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam. It's about attitude.",Michael
I have the worst attitude of any person here.,Pam
Do you want the raise or what?,Michael
"Yeah, I'll take it. [turns to leave]",Pam
"Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached. [Pam sighs] And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.",Michael
You're bribing me?,Pam
No! No-- no I am not. Unless you want me to. DO you want me to? Cause I will. I will bribe you. No. Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing. What is it? Talk to me face. Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking. Come on! What do you want? What do you want? Do you want a million dollars? Do you want to hit me? Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--,Michael
I want to hit you.,Pam
What?,Michael
I want to hit you. I'll do that.,Pam
"[nervous laughter] Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding?",Michael
No. Are you kidding?,Pam
Ye-- No. Alright. I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--,Michael
No. I don't think I can hit you in the office.,Pam
Okay.,Michael
"So, um... we'll do it after work. In the parking lot. In front of everyone. I'm going to hit you as hard as I can.",Pam
Okay.,Michael
Okay.,Pam
Okay.,Michael
See you then.,Pam
See you.,Michael
Hey.,Ryan
Hey.,Michael
Quick question.,Ryan
Yeah.,Kelly
Are you scared?,Ryan
Never. About what? A little-- what are you talking--,Michael
We heard about the punch.,Ryan
What punch?,Michael
Pam. She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work.,Kelly
I'm pretty sure we said slap.,Michael
"No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.",Kelly
I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen. Do you?,Ryan
I-- mmm-- I'm good.,Michael
alright. See you there.,Ryan
Hey.,Michael
Hey.,Jim
Do you and Pam ever get frisky?,Michael
Inappropriate.,Jim
I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?,Michael
All the time.,Jim
Really?,Michael
Yeah.,Jim
She strong?,Michael
She wants it bad Michael.,Jim
Can you stop this?,Michael
I can.,Jim
Okay.,Michael
And I don't support her choice to hit you.,Jim
I don't either.,Michael
But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.,Jim
Mmm-hmm. I know.,Michael
I just need some time.,Jim
You gotta do something--,Michael
I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.,Jim
How much time do you think you'll need?,Michael
No more than a week. Maybe two weeks.,Jim
"Come on, man!",Michael
"Pam, can I talk to you for a second?",Toby
Oh...,Pam
"I heard about the hit. Just-- make sure it's off company property, right?",Toby
Right.,Pam
"Okay, I think we should probably be okay.",Toby
Okay.,Pam
Okay. And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot. So its-- its all one motion through the-- body. So you stay a little low and there's a twist. You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm. [demonstrates punch] Pow!,Toby
[stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot.,Pam
Yes.,Toby
Okay. [punches Toby's hand],Pam
Yes.,Toby
Wow!,Pam
Okay.,Toby
"Hey everybody, he's not in the men's room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him.",Meredith
My money's on Pam.,Kevin
It's not a fight. What other outcome could there be?,Oscar
Michael could win.,Kevin
How? He can't hit back.,Oscar
Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?,Kevin
Am I scared of getting hit in the face? No. Everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege. I'm scared I'm gonna love it. [claps hands] Let's do this.,Michael
It's okay guys... I can handle this. Everybody can go home.,Michael
"We're here for the show, Michael.",Kevin
You're just a bunch of voyeurs. Are you eating popcorn?,Michael
It has almost no calories.,Kelly
Are you ready?,Pam
Yes.,Michael
"[goes to punch Michael; he flinches] You have to keep your hands down, Michael.",Pam
I know. [sighs] Okay. Alright. [Pam goes to punch him again] Oh-- God!,Michael
"Michael, you have to put your hands down.",Pam
Put your hands in your pockets.,Angela
"Okay! [braces himself] Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.",Michael
What are you sorry for?,Pam
So many things. I don't know. It's hard to choose.,Michael
How about for dating my mom?,Pam
Maybe that--,Michael
And dumping her on her birthday.,Pam
Yes.,Michael
Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.,Pam
Okay. I promise. [Pam starts to walk away] For the record your mom came on to me. [Pam turns around and slaps him; he gasps],Michael
Holy crap.,Phyllis
Are you okay?,Pam
No!,Michael
You're okay.,Pam
Feel better?,Jim
No. You were right.,Pam
"[walks with Michael back into the office; Michael is clutching is face and limping] Wait, why are you limping?",Dwight
I don't know.,Michael
Let's get some raw meat on that face. I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.,Dwight
"As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes. And guess what? I have four kids. And I have a hover-car and a hover-house. And my wife is a runner and it shows. And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together. And I am happy and I am rich and I never die. It doesn't sound like much, but its enough for me.",Michael
Ahh... [Dwight is holding a frozen chicken to his face],Michael
"Good, good. Keep it on there for another five minutes. Just let the swelling go down.",Dwight
Oh thank you. Thanks. I owe you one Dwight.,Michael
Fire Jim.,Dwight
No.,Michael
I'm cashing in the favor. Fire him.,Dwight
What are you talking about--,Michael
Do it. Promote me. Tri-managers.,Dwight
Forget that.,Michael
Can I have an office?,Dwight
No.,Michael
You know what you can keep your stupid favor. It's worthless. And this is my dinner on your face. I'm keeping it.,Dwight
[pats face] Oh that feels better.,Michael
"[screaming, Phyllis and Dwight wrestling] Got you! Broken arm! Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom! Ha, gonna flip you!",Dwight
"Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.",Jim
"How can I pose this to you in a relatable way? You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives? You cannot go wrong with a throat punch [screams, pretends to punch Meredith in the throat]",Dwight
"OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.",Jim
"No, there is a defense for that. Let me demonstrate. Someone attack me. Kevin, go!",Dwight
No way. Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.,Kevin
False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me!,Dwight
"OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.",Jim
That is correct. Unless there happened to be measles present.,Dwight
"So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?",Jim
Easy. Allow me to demonstrate. I am attacking myself with a throat punch. Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch] Block. Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist],Dwight
"And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.",Jim
"Good point. Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself] Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut. Uh oh, up to the nose. No, you're not. Ow! Oh!",Dwight
"Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.",Jim
"He really is, but not for long. [steps on foot] Ow! Instep, oh, not again. [more screaming] You let go, you let go. Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.",Dwight
You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.,Jim
The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise. [hits himself in the groin and moans],Dwight
But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.,Michael
I did stand up comedy once.,Andy
You did?,Michael
"Yeah, I killed.",Andy
That sounds like it was hilarious.,Michael
It was hilarious.,Andy
Michael?,Dwight
Yes?,Michael
What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?,Dwight
"You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.",Michael
"This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.",Dwight
"Woo hoo, shout out!",Michael
Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal. I just want to stress that it's all conjecture. If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.,Dwight
"Erin, do we have the journal?",Michael
Your feelings journal? You told me to put it in the time capsule.,Erin
Did you?,Michael
"Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.",Pam
"Oh, the Wall.",Michael
"I found the article. [everyone walks over to his desk, he begins reading the article] 'On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's. It is rumored that they will recommend... ' and the article cuts off.",Oscar
It's $1.99 to finish the article. I wonder what it was going to say? [no one makes a move to pay for the article],Michael
Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer],Jim
"I got it, I got it... Oh, Tuna beat me to it.",Andy
It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.',Phyllis
"No, no, that doesn't make any sense.",Michael
"Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs.",Stanley
"Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things. Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.",Oscar
"Oh, that sounds awful.",Michael
Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.,Oscar
"Oh God. Well, that's an interesting theory.",Michael
You know what? You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows. It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.,Dwight
"I'm sorry, Michael, David's in a meeting.",David Wallace's Secretary
"Ah, well maybe you should spy on him. [in Valley Girl voice] Oh my God, wouldn't that be hilarious! [laughs]",Michael
"Um, I'll just have him call you back.",David Wallace's Secretary
"OK, OK. Good. I'll catch you on the flippity flip. Bye. [hangs up phone] He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free.",Michael
"[retching sounds coming from the men's bathroom, Kevin walks to the door and goes in] Michael, are you OK? Did you throw up in there?",Kevin
"No, I'm just poopin'. You know how I be.",Michael
It smells like throw up in here.,Kevin
Crazy world. Lotta smells.,Michael
"[in lunch room with several coworkers] Guys, what if this is our last day at work? What if we never see each other ever again? [Andy scoffs and looks over at Erin, Erin looks sad]",Kelly
"I like Erin. There, I said it. I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws.",Andy
"[Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing] We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.",Jim
"OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody. Anything new on YouTube? Doesn't even need to be good. Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins.",Michael
"Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine. So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.",Jim
"Monkey see, monkey do.",Michael
That's it.,Jim
Monkey pee all over you.,Michael
"That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?",Jim
We have a monthly staff meeting,Michael
"Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room] Here's the deal guys. There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.",Jim
"Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better. I only slack off when things are good.",Jim
"Customers have to use the coupon code from the website. And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.",Jim
[Michael leaves] He needs me. Seat saved infinity. [leaves],Dwight
"OK, great.",Jim
"[walks back in, on cell phone] What? Oh my God! [everyone starts asking questions] There has been a murder. There's been a murder in Savannah. [runs back to his office]",Michael
"Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations. Battleship got me through my parents' divorce. Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation. I don't think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across.",Michael
"[reading the game box cover] Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game.",Meredith
"It is so much fun. Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it...",Michael
"Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.",Jim
"This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about murder.",Michael
I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.,Jim
"Tube City, you owe me one.",Michael
"Co-managing is a give and take. You have to pick your battles. One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them. He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.",Jim
"August the 5th, 1955. It's a sad day down here in Savannah. Local magnate Bill Bourbon was killed last night and all y'all have congregated tonight for a meal to celebrate Bill as he passes on to his great reward. You're not just here to pay your respects, you have to figure out which of y'all is the no-count scoundrel who killed him.",Voice on CD player
"This is ridiculous. [gets up to leave, as does Angela]",Stanley
"There will be food. You leave, you do not get food.",Michael
What kind of food?,Stanley
Sandwich platters.,Michael
I'm in. [sits back down],Stanley
Baby carrots. [Angela sits back down],Michael
"OK, here are your character cards. Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props. Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is. Everything else is up to your imagination. So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse.",Michael
"Whoa, I'll try it.",Kevin
"OK, use your imaginations.",Michael
Who'd you get?,Andy
"Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.",Erin
"Oooooo, saucy.",Andy
How about you?,Erin
"Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother.",Andy
"Michael, I don't like this game. It's scary.",Angela
It's not scary.,Michael
I don't like my character.,Angela
Who are you?,Pam
"Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps. I'm not comfortable with this. [holds up a head]",Angela
"Well how do you think I feel? I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy. Every night, a different woman. Being oogled. Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful.",Michael
"[looks at Oscar who is using his phone, grabs it] Well, well, well. What is this contraption, I do declare?",Michael
"It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.",Oscar
"Who's Michael? I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.",Michael
You don't have to keep saying 'I do declare'. Any time you say something it means you are declaring.,Ryan
That is the way Southern people talk.,Michael
And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?,Jim
"Delta Burke, I do declare. Now, shall we get to the mystery?",Michael
"I'll go. [stands up, begins speaking with a southern accent] My name is Deborah U. Tante. Deb for short.",Pam
"That's clever, Debutante.",Andy
Bill Bourbon was my uncle. I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug.,Pam
Nice accent. You sound like Forrest Gump.,Meredith
I do not.,Pam
"Well, you do actually. You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth.",Andy
"Oooo, now do the Swedish chef.",Kevin
"Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?",Andy
"He lives on Sesame Street, dumbass.",Kevin
"You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK? [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.",Phyllis
"Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm the butler. You were listening in on that? You rich people. You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!",Dwight
"No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing.",Michael
I will poison your food.,Dwight
"I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind.",Andy
"Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!",Michael
I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters.,Michael
Y'all.,Kevin
"[Creed pulls into the parking lot and goes into the office] Sorry I'm late, boss. What's going on?",Creed
"[accent] Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.",Michael
OK. Hang on just a second. Let me just settle in and I'll be right back.,Creed
"Very good, very good. Now, no one was there in the wine cellar. [Creed gets in his car and drives away]",Michael
[in character] Hey there young lady.,Andy
Hello.,Erin
I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.,Andy
"Sounds like a plan, Sugar.",Erin
"Alright, a plan it is.",Andy
"Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.",Dwight
"It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.",Angela
I know you did it!,Dwight
"I know she didn't do it. It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most. Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.",Dwight
[in character] Do you want to go out on a date with me? We can make out by the horses.,Kevin
"Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay.",Erin
How about a threesome?,Meredith
"Yeah, my boudoir's always open.",Erin
Nice.,Kevin
"I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin. Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone. And she might be a murderer.",Andy
"I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.",Oscar
What does that mean?,Phyllis
"Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-",Oscar
"[accent] Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son? This here's Savannah.",Michael
"[tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks. We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt. We can't pay... [in regular voice] - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern.",Oscar
"OK, I'm going back to work.",Jim
No no no no no no no. [accent] I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue. Here we go.,Michael
Well by now you've figured out that ol' Beatrix Bourbon was the killer.,Voice on CD player
"Michael, I was doing so well.",Phyllis
"[accent] Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection. We still don't know who the murderer is. [everyone leaves] Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here. I can't do this myself. Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?",Michael
"OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.",Jim
That could be a good sign.,Kevin
"Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation. Let's listen up.",Angela
"Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.",Jim
"Now, Jim telling us all to work? I think that is a very good sign.",Kevin
Don't just say things.,Angela
"[Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets. Do you want to-",Jim
"[accent] I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y'all skedaddled way too soon. We need to reopen this case.",Michael
"No, you're not reopening the case. The case is closed.",Jim
No it ain't.,Michael
"Frankly, I'm not surprised. A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.",Dwight
"Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie's. It's funny, the guy's dead the whole time.",Andy
I haven't seen it.,Erin
"Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?",Andy
"[accent] Of course, Nathaniel.",Erin
"Yeah, OK.",Andy
[accent] Where are you taking me?,Erin
"[accent] Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah.",Andy
[accent] Savannah? That's a far way from Scranton.,Erin
Did you mean a real date?,Andy
No. [laughs] Did you?,Erin
Totally... not. [Erin gets up and walks away],Andy
"I thought it was for real. So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.",Erin
"You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?",Dwight
"I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.",Michael
"Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.",Dwight
"This is not a game, this is my life. You are out of order, sir.",Michael
Answer me.,Dwight
You are out of order.,Michael
You are out of order.,Dwight
You are-,Michael
I think Michael may have snapped.,Pam
Or maybe he's just stuck in character.,Jim
"Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?",Pam
Both. They're both worse.,Jim
"It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out. We're not going under.",Jim
"Jim, what if we both lose our jobs? I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one.",Pam
"[comes into Jim's office using accent] Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors?",Michael
"Michael, not now.",Jim
"Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now. Come on. Come on.",Michael
I should just go. [accent] Where to now Caleb?,Pam
To Mama Juju Boo Boo.,Michael
"Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.",Jim
Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.,Michael
[laying on the ground] I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks.,Meredith
Hey shut up. You're dead.,Dwight
"Michael, can I talk to you in your office?",Jim
"No Michael here, my name is-",Michael
Caleb!,Jim
Today of all days...,Jim
"No, you shut up. They need this game, Jim. Let us have this stupid little game, alright? [Jim nods]",Michael
"[accent] Oh, you startled me. My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest. What can I do you for?",Michael
Wallace is on the phone. He's returning your call.,Erin
Detective Wallace?,Michael
I don't think so. I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.,Erin
"Aw, shucks, tell him I'm not here.",Michael
You're not gonna answer the phone?,Oscar
"No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room.",Michael
I'll take it.,Jim
Hey David.,Jim
"Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late. Things are still a bit unclear, we didn't officially decide anything yet.",David
"Oh, OK.",Jim
"But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it's not good. We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year. Insolvent. So, well... You know what? I'm sorry, I have to run. But we will talk soon, OK?",David
"Sure. Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-",Jim
"You know what? I can't really get my head around anything like that right now, but that's great. Keep after it, but I gotta run.",David
OK.,Jim
Thanks Jim.,David
See ya.,Jim
[Jim comes out of the office] What's the news?,Pam
Nothing yet.,Jim
"Well, I guess that's not-",Phyllis
Well there is some bad news. [accent] There has been another murder.,Jim
"A murder, you say? I do declare.",Michael
Conference room everyone.,Jim
Do we have to play?,Stanley
No.,Jim
Super.,Stanley
"Oh, this could be a juicy one.",Dwight
Get in there!,Michael
"I think today was a good day to have two managers. 'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing. But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy. It's because they're doing it for the kids. And I get that now.",Jim
"There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue. My little heart can barely take it no more. [regular voice] Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time.",Michael
"[Andy, Michael, and Dwight are pointing imaginary guns at each other] I didn't do it!",Andy
"OK, everybody just calm down.",Dwight
I am calm.,Andy
On the count of three we're all going to put down our guns.,Michael
I have crossbows.,Dwight
"We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?",Michael
"OK, I'm ready.",Dwight
"One, two, three.. [all scream]",Michael
"Andy revealed himself to be a double agent. At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent. And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent. Oh, and it is 6:00.",Jim
"[Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their 'weapons' on each other, Jim walks in] Really?",Jim
[accent] It wasn't me. I'm not goin' down for this!,Pam
"Yeah, I want to go home.",Jim
"Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. [Jim and Pam slowly back out of the office, Pam has her weapon trained on everyone and then they run out]",Pam
[Dwight enters dressed as Recyclops] Not again.,Oscar
Bow down before Recyclops.,Dwight
"Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.",Jim
"Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?",Dwight
The next year he really stepped things up.,Jim
Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?,Dwight
A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.,Jim
Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.,Dwight
Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.,Jim
Recyclops will have his revenge.,Dwight
I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.,Jim
"Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops.",Pam
Recyclops destroys! [starts tearing through the office],Dwight
"Oh, is today Recyclops Day?",Stanley
Yes.,Dwight
I thought you were killed by Polluticorn.,Stanley
Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something],Dwight
That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment.,Andy
Humans are terrible for the environment.,Dwight
The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.,Pam
Mmm.,Jim
A world where you truly can be anything you want.,Pam
"God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]",Jim
"[seated] Ok. Ok. How 'bout this? [rises, waves, sits back down]",Michael
That's great.,Pam
"I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing. [demonstrates]",Michael
Sure.,Pam
Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face.,Michael
And it looks like you're taking a dump.,Meredith
"Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder's meeting and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild.",Michael
"[doing an announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael 'The Machine' Scott. [Michael waves, twirls and sits down]",Andy
Don't do the twirl.,Pam
Lose the twirl.,Phyllis
The twirl sucks.,Dwight
"Michael, I hated the twirl.",Kevin
[still doing the voice & spinning in his chair] Hate the twirl!,Andy
Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.,Michael
"Yeah, good. Don't do it.",Phyllis
"I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin.",Michael
The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.,Oscar
"Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.",Michael
Those are the bullet points.,Oscar
"Well, could you condense it please?",Michael
That's as simple as I can make it.,Oscar
Michael? The limo's here for you.,Erin
"It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.",Michael
"He said limousine, so...",Erin
"[at window in conference room] Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here. [everyone heads to the conference room] Michael, look. Oh, man.",Kevin
They sent a limo.,Michael
Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.,Michael
"[everyone is rushing down the stairs to see the limo] Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.",Michael
What kind of mileage does this baby get?,Dwight
It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.,Erin
This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.,Oscar
Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.,Michael
Calves. Calves all the way.,Dwight
I'm so jealous right now.,Andy
"Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you're invited and you're invited and you're invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-",Michael
Car seats eight.,Limo Driver
What?,Michael
The car seats eight.,Limo Driver
The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.,Michael
No thanks.,Jim & Pam
I'll use it when you're done.,Ryan
[others start raising their hands to be picked] Mmm... whoa.,Michael
"The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.",Oscar
"[in the limo with Dwight, Andy and Oscar] I wish the windows weren't tinted so people could see us in here.",Michael
"Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had sex in here?",Andy
Definitely.,Michael
Smells like it.,Dwight
Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed.,Michael
Word.,Dwight
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!,Andy
[the limo driver raises the divider window] Who's playing with the button?,Michael
"Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?",Jim
"Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under.",Ryan
But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.,Jim
"The company's probably going under, though.",Ryan
Could go either way.,Jim
Seems like it's leaning one way.,Ryan
Maybe we should just wait and find out.,Jim
Definitely.,Ryan
Ok.,Jim
So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?,Ryan
Nah. Might as well do it now.,Jim
"Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?",Andy
I will have to answer.,Michael
I'll ask you a question.,Dwight
"Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.",Andy
Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?,Dwight
"No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.' [they all laugh] I won't say that. I'll something like that.",Michael
This is your big day. Come on.,Andy
"Oh, my god. This is it.",Michael
Mr. Scott?,Laurie
Yes.,Michael
I'm Laurie.,Laurie
"Oh, hi.",Michael
Thank you for joining us. Come with me.,Laurie
"Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott.",Michael
Ok. If you just want to follow me I'll take you up to the lounge.,Laurie
"Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So -",Michael
Kay.,Andy
"Good luck, Michael.",Dwight
See you later.,Michael
[walking past bodyguards at the door] Officers. Thank you.,Michael
"After you, Mr. Scott.",Laurie
Thank you.,Michael
Michael.,David
Hello.,Michael
So glad you could make it.,David
Thank you.,Michael
How was the ride?,David
"Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime.",Michael
"I'm glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we'll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton.",David
"It's nice to meet you, Michael.",Alan
"It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege.",Michael
"Seated, we have the former congressman, Chris O'Keefe.",David
Ah. [bows] Your eminence.,Michael
"For those of you with questions, please line up behind one of the four microphones that have been placed in the aisles.",Registrar
"Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts]",Dwight
"I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.",Dwight
"Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.",Oscar
"Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line.",Andy
"Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.",Oscar
"Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis?",Andy
How is he gonna have grandkids?,Dwight
You guys ever protect the president?,Michael
No.,Security
What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?,Michael
Not supposed to talk about it. Nelly Furtado.,Security
"Alright, guys. You ready?",Alan
Rock and roll. [they walk into convention room and are booed by everyone],Michael
Dunder Mifflin is still a strong company. We are poised to come through this more streamlined and profitable than ever. [boos from the crowd],Alan
[to David] This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.,Michael
It was fun when we weren't on the brink of bankruptcy.,David
"[accidentally into his microphone] We're going bankrupt, you think? [angry jeering from the crowd] They are really angry.",Michael
The shareholders need to empower our leadership -,Alan
I'm just gonna run to the bathroom. Will you save my place?,Woman in line
Sure.,Man in line
No. You will not.,Dwight
Excuse me?,Woman in line
"Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?",Dwight
It'll just be a second.,Woman in line
Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.,Dwight
"... and we're confident. There are many things to be optimistic about in Dunder Mifflin's future and one of them is here with us today. Michael Scott, Scranton Branch manager.",Alan
[loudly applauds] Yes.,Dwight
"In these uncertain times, Michael has managed to maintain steady profits from his Scranton branch. We all thank you, Michael. [scattered applause] Another bright spot in the Dunder Mifflin landscape, our new waste pulp re-purposing plant in Milford. [applause]",Alan
"Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?",Jim
Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.,Phyllis
Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.,Jim
"Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things.",Phyllis
I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.,Jim
That doesn't make you a boss.,Stanley
It's not like you can fire people or anything.,Phyllis
"Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?",Jim
Ryan.,Phyllis
Can't say.,Stanley
Sorry. Plastered.,Phyllis
Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam],Jim
Stuff gets around. I don't participate.,Pam
Who here heard it from Ryan?,Jim
Does and email count?,Kevin
Yes.,Jim
Yeah. [everyone raises hands again],Kevin
"I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright? Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment, is the only one who raises her hand]",Jim
I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.,Pam
These questions are bush league.,Oscar
You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there. [points to Oscar's heart] Don't be a wuss.,Andy
"I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose .",Andy
"[over the crowd booing] Believe me everyone is working very hard, working weekends, struggling, trying to right the ship.",David
You're a criminal.,Shareholder
"Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That's -",Michael
Limousine?,Female Shareholder
Yes.,Michael
You're all corrupt. You should be in jail. [crowd agrees],Second Shareholder
"Quiet! Quiet, please! Please, quiet! Quiet, please. We want to hear your questions.",Alan
Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?,Ryan
"I don't know, man. I just don't know.",Creed
I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?,Jim
Can you actually fire people?,Pam
"To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.",Jim
"Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone.",Pam
"Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.",Jim
"Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'.",Pam
"Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.",Jim
"Well, you'll figure it out.",Pam
Ok. We're gonna take a 15 minute break and then we're gonna answer more questions.,Alan
You haven't said anything yet and we're headed for bankruptcy. [crowd agrees],Third Shareholder
"[board of directors has started to exit] Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with some answers. [a few murmurs from the crowd of 'What answers?'] I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them -",Michael
How are you gonna fix the company?,Fourth Shareholder
"Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track. [crowd starts to agree and perk up] 45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business. [crowd applauds] And you can take that to the bank. [applause continue] And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral. [crowd has gotten very excited and is cheering] I love you, New York! [Michael does the spin and leaves the stage - then runs back across the stage] You. You.",Michael
"Hey, Ryan. How's it going?",Jim
"[playing Tetris on his computer] Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist...",Ryan
Mmm-hmm.,Jim
That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.,Ryan
"Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.",Jim
Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?,Ryan
You know what?,Jim
What?,Ryan
I think I know the problem.,Jim
Great.,Ryan
I think you seem distracted.,Jim
"Yep, that is a problem.",Ryan
"But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.",Jim
"Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim.",Ryan
"I am, too. Let me show you.",Jim
Wow. Things are really picking up.,Michael
What was that about?,O'Keefe
What?,Michael
You were supposed to wave.,Alan
I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.,Michael
What are we supposed to tell them now? Ok? You've dug us quite a hole.,David
"We tell them the plan, right?",Michael
There is no plan.,David
"Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.",Michael
Excuse me?,O'Keefe
Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.,Michael
Who the hell is this guy?,O'Keefe
I am the guy who roused that crowd.,Michael
Yes.,David
Got them on their feet.,Michael
Yes.,David
They were so happy down there.,Michael
Yes.,David
Who cares?,Alan
"Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor.",Michael
"No. No. No. No. No. No. Don't call anybody, Michael.",David
"Well, I'm texting him, so.",Michael
"Please do not text anybody, now, Michael.",David
"It's done. [Oscar, sitting in the lobby, receives a text]",Michael
"Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don't be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don't you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away. [Oscar stands there stunned]",Michael
"I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.",Jim
Mmm-hmm.,Ryan
"Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.",Jim
"I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.",Ryan
Right.,Jim
"Uh, I'm very sorry... about everything.",Ryan
[laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office],Jim
[from behind the door] Is there internet?,Ryan
Ummm...,Oscar
Tell them what you told me. This is genius.,Michael
Ok,Oscar
Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all -,Michael
Um..,Oscar
It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.,Michael
"I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.",Oscar
That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.,Michael
I think this has gone very well and I thank you.,Oscar
"O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. [follows Oscar into the hall] What are you doing?",Michael
"Michael, I didn't ask to come up here.",Oscar
"Wow, man. That -",Michael
What?,Oscar
That was embarrassing.,Michael
For me.,Oscar
"For me, too. You embarrassed me.",Michael
"You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room]",Oscar
"Well, that was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow.",Michael
He's our best manager? Where's the off button on this moron?,O'Keefe
"Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron.",Michael
[zipping through the hall while texting],Michael
"Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.' That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks. Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.",Michael
He can take the bus. He's had his limo ride.,O'Keefe
"[running out of the building with Oscar, Andy, and Dwight] Oscar! Oscar! Come on! There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!",Michael
"The gentleman in the, uh, glasses.",Alan
"Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. [cheers from crowd] Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. [crowd still applauding] A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.",Dwight
Thank you. Thank you for your suggestions.,Alan
Yeah.,Dwight
You wanted to see me?,Andy
"Yeah, Have a seat.",Michael
Is it serious? [Michael stares] Wow. Andy's a wittle scared.,Andy
"Okay, right there is the problem. There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.",Michael
Why would people say that?,Andy
I have it on good authority that you said the following. [hands Andy a notecard] Can you read that back to me?,Michael
Andy have a boo-boo tummy.,Andy
Mmm-hmm.,Michael
"Would you rather me say 'Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?'",Andy
Okay.,Michael
Crazy diarrhea happening right now?' Cause things can get real adult real fast.,Andy
"You are also on record as saying 'wittle-ittle,' 'footy-wutties,' 'nummies,' 'jammies,' 'make boom-boom,' 'widiculous,' and 'wode iwand.'",Michael
"Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes. Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across? Well if I do, Andy's sowwy.",Andy
You can't be a baby in the office. It makes me look like I hire babies.,Michael
"Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.",Andy
"Okay, who said that?",Michael
"I don't-just people. For the record, I think it's pretty fantastic.",Andy
"[Elvis voice] Well, thank you... thank you a lot. And for what it's worth I think your baby voice is tops.",Michael
[baby voice] Tank you Mr. Elwis.,Andy
"[as Elvis] You're welcome, baby.",Michael
"Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.",Andy
"Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?",Jim
The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.,Andy
"Wow, what do you put our chances at?",Jim
"0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!",Andy
"Hmm, sounds risky.",Jim
Don't worry. There is a surefire cure. Employee of the Month. Every awesome place I've worked has had one.,Andy
"Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron.",Andy
"Wow, that's not such a bad idea.",Jim
Great! [sits down],Andy
Anything else?,Jim
Nope! [stands up and leaves],Andy
Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day? There's a bunch of those.,Erin
Keep.,Michael
There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say 'Delivered.' Should I delete all of those?,Erin
I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.,Michael
That's why you have a 'Sent Mail' folder.,Erin
Keep.,Michael
There's about 30 news alerts for 'Nip Slip.',Erin
For what?,Michael
Nip slip.',Erin
Oh okay. I don't know how those got on there...,Michael
Well...,Erin
Must be hackers.,Michael
Hey. What's up?,Jim
"What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?",Michael
Did you murder someone?,Jim
Worse than that.,Michael
"Oh, my God.",Erin
Lurk much? [Erin leaves] I miss Pam.,Michael
I think she's okay.,Jim
Is that what we're going for now? 'okay?' We used to go for 'pretty good.',Michael
"Great. Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?",Jim
"Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better. I'm not in this for the trophies, but...",Michael
"You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.",Jim
"Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.",Michael
It would look bad. Sorry.,Jim
"It would look good, on my mantle.",Michael
Jim's talking to Michael right now. They totally went for our idea!,Andy
Yeah! Your idea.,Dwight
"My idea. I just need Andy to think it's his idea. So it won't get traced back to me. In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace. He will be fired.",Dwight
"Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?",Erin
[glances at it] Looks great.,Pam
"Oh, did you really look it over? Felt like maybe you didn't.",Erin
Okay. [picks up and reads sheet] The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?,Pam
There you are. I don't think we have finished with my Inbox.,Michael
What's 'Scott's Tots?',Phyllis
Has it really been ten years?,Stanley
[shows newspaper article and reads] 'Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders',Stanley
"Michael, why did you promise that?",Pam
To change lives.,Michael
"No Michael, why would you promise that?",Pam
"Yeah, okay. Call the school, cancel. I can't go through with this.",Michael
We've already rescheduled seven times.,Erin
"Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done.",Pam
Well...,Michael
It's terrible.,Pam
No.,Michael
"Just terrible. And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get.",Pam
"I just, I fell in love with those kids. and I didn't want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise. I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education. I've made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.",Michael
"Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?",Michael
No!,Pam
"I'm not a bad person, I bring good news. Like when I promised those kids I'd pay for college. Okay, all right.",Michael
You have to tell them.,Pam
"Would you come with me? You know, like old times, instead of... [makes yuck face at Erin]",Michael
I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it.,Erin
"It's fine. Erin, you're going to go. And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth.",Pam
"Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?",Michael
"Hey Jimmy, what's up?",Dwight
Not much.,Jim
"Cool. Very cool. I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.",Dwight
[laughs] Thanks Dwight.,Jim
That laugh is so infectious.,Dwight
You're creeping me out. I'm gonna go.,Jim
I didn't mean any of those things I just said. And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud. Make it about the work.,Dwight
"Let me guess, you think you should get it.",Jim
"This encompasses all available data. Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation. Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency. Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.",Dwight
"Well, in an ideal world...",Jim
"In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.",Dwight
"Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away 'Survival Skills' and 'Self-defense.'",Jim
I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.,Dwight
"That's okay, I'll do it.",Jim
Mr. Scott?,Mikela
"Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?",Michael
I'm good.,Mikela
Good to see you. Where's your saxaphone?,Michael
"It's in the music room, Mr. Scott.",Mikela
"Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.",Michael
Wow!,Erin
"Well, you didn't even hear it.",Michael
Everyone's so excited that you're here today.,Mikela
"Oh, good.",Michael
"Now, I know you probably want to see everyone, but I was wondering if I could ask you some questions first?",Mikela
Sure.,Michael
[points to a sign saying The Michael Gary Scott Reading Room] You're famous.,Erin
I'm sure you remember this place.,Mikela
"Oh, yeah.",Michael
Do you want to go in?,Mikela
"No, not at all. Nope, come on.",Michael
"Oh, you know what? You know what? I shouldn't go in there. I'm pretty busy, I should just...",Michael
We just want to say thanks.,Mikela
Oh.,Michael
[cheering] Mr. Scott! Mr. Scott! Mr. Scott!,Students
"Mr. Scott, I know you're a busy man, and your schedule moves around a lot. But through all your generosity through the years, your tots, who are ready to graduate, thought it was time to give you a proper thank you.",Teacher
"[getting up and dancing] Oh! What? Oh! Break it down! Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true! Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true! Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true!",Students
"You came into our lives and made a promise, made us honest, made us realize, we don't need to compromise, cause we can have it all! Cause you made it possible, for us to achieve the improbable!",Lefevre
"Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true!",Students
Wow!,Michael
"Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-",Dwight
Hey.,Kevin
So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.,Dwight
Jim said that?,Kevin
He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.,Dwight
Jim said that?,Kevin
You seem suprised.,Dwight
"No, no, that makes total sense.",Kevin
"Hey buddy, so every-",Dwight
Sure. [puts in the twenty],Oscar
Five minutes ahead of schedule. Right on schedule.,Dwight
"Politicians are always coming around, telling us they're going to fix our schools, promising this and that. But you, Mr. Scott, you are actually doing it. You have taught these kids with hard work, that anything is possible. You are a dream maker and I thank you! I thank you, I thank you, I thank you, I thank you! So much.",Teacher
"There were a lot of times over the years where I was pressured to get into the drug game. But I always thought back to my guardian angel, and the gift that you gave me. So I just want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to go to college, educate myself, and become the next President Obama.",Lefevre
"[crying] Oh, God. Oh, God.",Michael
"Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome. I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes. And the winner is, employee number nine. And that is?",Jim
"Number nine, number nine. Jim Halpert.",Andy
Huh? What?,Everyone
Are you kidding me?,Oscar
"Oh, no!",Dwight
"Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-",Jim
I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?,Kevin
"Guys, listen. This was anonymous, all right? There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here. I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.",Jim
"To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.",Angela
"Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it. A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out. Second of all, there was no cash prize.",Jim
Yes!,Angela
Dwight?,Jim
"Yeah, you said 'In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize.' Isn't that what you said?",Dwight
"No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money. But-",Jim
"Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.",Phyllis
"Let's put your hands together and give a warm welcome for the man of the hour, Mr. Michael Scott.",Teacher
"All right. Wow. Um, I am never going to forget today. Not a chance. I don't think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today. Who here has done something stupid in their lives? Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between 'A' gym and 'B' gym, that sort of thing? Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay. Well, me too, I've done something stupid which I would like to share. Ummm. [period bell rings] Should we go?",Michael
"Oh, no. We're okay. It's a double period",Teacher
"Ah. All right. I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable. But you know what's invaluable is intuition. You know what that is? That is the ability to know when something is about to happen. Does anybody out there have intuition? Know what's gonna happen next? Nobody? Okay, you're going to make me say it. All right, I am so proud of all of you. Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and... I'm sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?",Michael
"I'm Zion, I'm Mikela's younger brother.",Zion
"Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition. Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition. I'm so, so sorry.",Michael
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.,Michael
You lied to us.,Mikela
"I lied to myself too. I'm not a millionaire. I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even close. And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30. Maybe by my 50s, I don't know. I wanted to pay for your education. I really did. It was my dream. Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams. My dream was in the right place.",Michael
You owe this to us!,Lefevre
"Okay, hold on. Hold on. Now I can't pay for your college. But you don't have to go to class to be in class. Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience. And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop. [students perk up] Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.",Michael
[yelling],Students
"Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. They're lithium.",Michael
"Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it. Okay? This was your idea anyway.",Jim
Correction. It was my idea.,Andy
Okay.,Jim
My idea!,Dwight
"Guys, I'm starting to think Pam's not really even pregnant.",Creed
"Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on.",Pam
That's fair.,Phyllis
"Excellent idea, Pam.",Dwight
Thank you.,Pam
"That would be employee number three, which would be... son of a bitch, Pam Halpert.",Andy
"How is that possible? No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?",Phyllis
There must be some reasonable explanation for this.,Dwight
"No, wait, come on. I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.",Pam
"Oh, really? From what, two to four?",Andy
Yup.,Pam
"Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay?",Jim
"Hi, I have an order here for a custom cake, Jim Halpert.",Deliveryman
"Okay. That is me, but I didn't order the cake.",Jim
"Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim]",Kevin
It could only be you!' Way to go.,Angela
He knew all along!,Dwight
I'm going to have some cake.,Kelly
David Wallace's office.,Stephanie
"[imitating Kevin] This is Kevin Malone, is David there?",Dwight
"No, he's in his weekly staff meeting, can I take a message?",Stephanie
"Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.",Dwight
[imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson. Jim Halpert is a menace.,Dwight
"[imitating Toby] It's Toby Flenderson. Listen, things are getting really bad down here.",Dwight
"Hey, Mr. Scott.",Lefevre
"Erin, can you give us a second?",Michael
That was messed up what you did.,Lefevre
"Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry.",Michael
Who does something like that? Who promises that to a bunch of kids and then just doesn't come through like that?,Lefevre
What can I do?,Michael
You can pay for my college.,Lefevre
"I can give you an extra laptop battery. Not everyone took one. How about this? If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?",Michael
They're expensive.,Lefevre
"Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?",Michael
"It's about $1,000.",Lefevre
Really? Wow. That's over $200 a year.,Michael
"No, $1,000 each year.",Lefevre
"For-okay, okay here's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each. I'm going to date them one year apart. Now, you are to use one check a year. And please call me before you cash the check? Cause I've got monies to move around.",Michael
"Okay. Okay. Make it out to my mom, Rosa.",Lefevre
That's a lot of zeroes.,Michael
This is Jim.,Jim
"Jim, what the hell is happening there?",David Wallace
"Hey, uh David.",Jim
Yes.,David
"So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today. It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.",Jim
"Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife?",David
No.,Jim
Am I missing something?,David
"I really don't know how it happened, David.",Jim
I know how it happened.,Dwight
"Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier. If you can't do that, we're going to have a separate discussion.",David
"All right, it will not happen again. I promise.",Jim
"Uh, hey, I'm sorry. I'm taking this out on you.",David
No!,Dwight
"It's been crazy here. You know I think you're doing a great job, right?",David
What?,Dwight
Yeah. Thank you.,Jim
No.,Dwight
"Okay. Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend?",David
What?,Dwight
Yes.,Jim
Okay.,David
"Oh, you're kidding me!",Dwight
See you.,Jim
Damn it!,Dwight
"Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---",Erin
Please stop. 15 lives. I destroyed 15 young lives today.,Michael
No.,Erin
Yes.,Michael
"No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.",Erin
"You're what, like, 12?",Michael
"The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school. So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out. Which is something to think about, I think.",Erin
I think you're doing a great job.,Michael
Really?,Erin
"What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn't go out of business?",Michael
I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.,Erin
Really?,Michael
"Yes, but I'm terrible at math so...",Erin
"You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.",Michael
Seriously?,Erin
Yeah. I just sort've had a feeling about him. I have a feeling about you too.,Michael
"Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.",Michael and Erin
"See you tomorrow, Dwight.",Jim
Apparently.,Dwight
How's it going? Good day?,Ryan
"Not now, Temp.",Dwight
"Um, okay, so, um, listen. I know about your diabolical plan.",Ryan
What? Diabolical plan? I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol... [Ryan holds up a written copy of Dwight's daibolical plan],Dwight
I found a copy of it in the copier tray.,Ryan
So what do you want?,Dwight
I want the same thing you want. I want to take Jim Halpert down. I want in.,Ryan
"[yelling] Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--",Dwight
Too loud.,Jim
--the party planning committee...,Dwight
"Too, too loud. Too Loud.",Jim
"But effective, look! [everyone turns to pay attention] On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.",Dwight
Merry Christmas.,Everyone
Merry Christmas. Good.,Dwight
My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! [laughs] Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed.,Dwight
It is time to unveil the tree.,Dwight
"Hey, Rockefeller Center!",Oscar
Yeah.,Jim
"Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.",Ryan
This is all we have.,Jim
Ugh.,Ryan
"No, it's not 'ugh.' It is... office camaraderie.",Jim
It is warm feelings.,Dwight
Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it?,Meredith
Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight! [others join],Dwight
Why would you start so high?,Jim
Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ...,Dwight
"Three, two, one! [pulls sheet to reveal Christmas tree]",Jim
Ooh.,Phyllis
Ah!,Pam
You didn't decorate it?,Phyllis
No.,Jim
Exactly.,Dwight
"We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.",Jim
Everyone.,Dwight
"Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you're not covering anything up?",Andy
"Is it, is it fake?",Pam
Pam!,Jim
"Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die...",Dwight
Yes.,Jim
Like the spirit of Christmas!,Dwight
We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?,Stanley
This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!,Dwight
"Hello. Sorry guys. [louder, face is scratched up.] Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.",Erin
What psycho would send that as a gift? [Kelly hugs Erin],Kelly
I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds? [six geese are inside Erin's car],Andy
"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!",Phyllis
Hey Santa!,Dwight
They finally let you do it!,Oscar
Yeah!,Phyllis
Congrats Phil!,Kevin
It's so edgy!,Erin
"I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. [she awkwardly hugs Jim] It's been a long journey... but [sniffles] I'm Santa Claus!",Phyllis
"So Santa, what can we expect from this party?",Pam
It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!,Phyllis
What if you've been bad?,Creed
Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!,Phyllis
"What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong?",Creed
"Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!",Jim
Yeah.,Phyllis
"For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!",Dwight
"You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!",Pam
That's funny.,Oscar
"Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny. [she walks over to see Oscar at the window looking down on man catching a football in parking lot] I think my water just broke!",Pam
That's too funny.,Oscar
Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!,Pam
"Heeeeeere's Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see. [points to Pam's' pregnant tummy]",Michael
"Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis.",Pam
What the hell is going on?,Michael
"Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?",Michael
Yeah.,Jim
Phyllis?,Michael
Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.,Jim
Take it back. That is absurd.,Michael
"No, I'm not gonna do that.",Jim
No? No! Jim! Come on!,Michael
I think she's doing a good job.,Jim
"It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!",Michael
I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.,Jim
"Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those.",Michael
"If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she'd ask you what you wanted, you would say probably 'freedom.' At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It's a good thing Russia doesn't exist anymore.",Michael
"[santa voice] Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I'm the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!",Michael
[mutters] Okay...,Group
"No it's not, not like penis-wise. [as Santa] Hello little boy, what's your name?",Michael
"Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap.",Kevin
"Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.",Michael
When can I sit on your lap?,Kevin
"Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go. [Kevin sits on his lap. It's a struggle] Oh my God.",Michael
That's really comfortable. [Michael gasps],Kevin
What would you like for Christmas little boy?,Michael
I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that.,Kevin
What did you think was going to happen?,Michael
I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before.,Kevin
"All right, just say 'some toys' please.",Michael
Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list.,Kevin
"Damn it Kevin, come on.",Michael
What about if I tell you the things I don't want?,Kevin
"Okay get off, get off! [pushes Kevin off] Oh! Oh, God!",Michael
I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted!,Kevin
Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again.,Michael
Awesome.,Kevin
Well?,Phyllis
I'm trying Phyllis. You're Santa.,Jim
The only Santa.,Phyllis
That's what I want.,Jim
You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved!,Phyllis
What would Bob do?,Jim
"Never mind, I shouldn't have said that.",Phyllis
Does it hurt?,Andy
It stings a lot.,Erin
Hmm.,Andy
I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts.,Erin
"I know, right?",Andy
So far no one will admit to it.,Erin
Huh!,Andy
"Is it you? [Andy stage face, eyes pop, big mouth smile, Erin laughs]",Erin
Yeah! Totally! I admit it! It's me.,Andy
Seriously?,Erin
Seriously?' Are you serious?,Andy
What?,Erin
Yeah! Totally serious! I'm your Secret Santa! Busted!,Andy
There he is.,Oscar
Hey.,Daryl
Is Matt around? I got his check.,Oscar
"Uh, Matt is on a delivery. Just leave it here, I'll take it.",Daryl
"Ah, I'll just... wait for him.",Oscar
"Matt's a pretty good-looking dude, don't you think?",Daryl
"I'll just leave it here with you. [drops checks, leaves. Daryl smirks]",Oscar
Ryan come here!,Michael
"Whoa, whoa.",Ryan
"Come on, come on.",Michael
I'm doing something over here.,Ryan
Ahhh... Ho ho ho! [struggles to pull Ryan towards him] Come on I need this. Come over here!,Michael
What are you talking about?,Ryan
Just sit down!,Michael
No no no.,Ryan
Hey hey hey. Everything okay?,Jim
Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!,Michael
Can I just talk to you for a second?,Jim
"Whoop! Okay, what?",Michael
"You can't yell out 'I need this, I need this' as you pin down an employee on your lap!",Jim
"Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless!",Michael
Yup.,Jim
"Do you understand, you forced my hand?",Michael
"Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.",Jim
"Oh, do we? Do 'We?' Is that what 'we' want? Why don't 'we' take a vote on it?",Michael
Great!,Jim
Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--,Michael
Who wants Phyllis as Santa? [most everyone raises their hand],Jim
"No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we --[Dwight counts the raised hands] Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?",Michael
Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.,Kevin
"And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. [Michael, then Dwight raises hand] Can I get you some punch?",Jim
I'll get some punch. That looks delicious. [shoves Santa hat into punch],Michael
"Aw, Michael!",Office
"Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.",Dwight
How do you know it's a gun?,Phyllis
What else does it look like?,Dwight
Not a gun.,Stanley
Well I don't have all the pieces yet.,Dwight
"Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun.",Stanley
Not a gun. [crosses gun off his 'what could it be' list],Dwight
"In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin! [Dwight plugs in tree lights, office applauds.]",Phyllis
"I don't ask for much for Christmas, I really don't. It's not like I'm begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. 'Oh buy me something expensive or I'm gonna kill myself.' That's not - I don't care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me? Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, don't look at me.",Michael
"Behold! [extends his arms] Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas. [Angela claps] Those of you who wish to join me, that's great. I'm excited by that. And those of you who don't, I forgive you. But I never forget.",Michael
"Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is.",Toby
Oh the Anti-Christ!,Michael
"You can't, [Michael touches his forehead and makes sizzling noise] Ow. Look, you cannot push religion.",Toby
Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you're saying?,Michael
No!,Toby
"Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!",Michael
"Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that I'm her Secret Santa?",Andy
"All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael.",Phyllis
Okay.,Andy
"[singing] I saw three ships come sailing in, on Christmas day, on Christmas day...",Kelly and Erin
Have you talked to him?,Pam
Who?,Oscar
Matt?,Pam
Is it that obvious? [Pam starts towards Matt] No- hey...,Oscar
"Mmm! Good pate, right? [Matt nods yes] Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?",Pam
I don't think so.,Matt
"Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.",Pam
I had some.,Matt
"Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?",Pam
Okay Pam.,Oscar
Okay.,Pam
Yes! They're the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.,Pam
This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!,Phyllis
We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot. [grabs package],Dwight
"[on karaoke microphone] Uh oh, what's Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?",Michael
Yes! [Dwight opens package to reveal another machine part],Dwight
Oh yes. It's space garbage. Dwight's gonna be able to build himself a friend! [sings] Deck the halls with crappy gifts...,Michael
Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year -,Phyllis
I have.,Stanley
"[on microphone] Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get?",Michael
He got scented candles!,Kevin
"[on microphone] Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of fire where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley.",Michael

It's fabric! I really wanted this.,Angela

No. [Michael gets up and walks into his office],Jim
"Yes Michael, what is so urgent?",David
"David, guess who I'm sitting here dressed as.",Michael
I'm not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up.,David
I'll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.,Michael

What?,Michael
This is a very very bad time.,David
Really? What's going on?,Michael

Do you want me off the call too Michael?,Erin
Hey! Get off! Get off the phone!,Michael
"Listen, I shouldn't tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house.",David
What does that mean?,Michael
I'll be fired.,David

Alan will be out too. All of us.,David
All of us?,Michael
Goodbye Michael.,David

"Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that's one suit Phyllis cannot fit into.",Michael
Hey. How's everybody doing?,Michael
Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.,Jim
That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.,Michael
Are you serious? This is so offensive.,Angela
"You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some... jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.",Michael
What's your pin number?,Dwight

It was a little much Andy.,Erin
Well it's the thought that counts.,Andy
What were you thinking? [Andy freezes],Erin
"I suppose a gentlemen might... throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen.",Andy
"You know what, Christmas isn't about Santa, or Jesus. It's about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you're my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas. And Stanley, you're our mailman. And I can't help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, 'How could they do this to us?'",Michael
What?,Jim
How could we do what? [general murmur],Pam
It's not... Nevermind. Nothing. [arguing voices],Michael
We deserve to know.,Stanley
I didn't say anything!,Michael
If you know something Michael...,Angela
We're going out of business!,Michael

You are kidding me!,Dwight

Come on!,Angela
"Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?",Jim
David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone.,Michael
Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.,Jim
"It's hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not - no offense Meredith.",Michael
"No, I get it.",Meredith
I'll call him. I'll call David.,Michael
"No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone.",Jim
"Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.",Michael
"He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school, I tell them I'm a pediatrician. They patch me through to his secretary. I use my little girl voice. Badda bing, badda boom.",Michael

You weren't supposed to tell anyone Michael.,David
Well I think we're past that now.,Michael
"I am not supposed to... Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don't know.",David
"Oh my God, David. That's horrible.",Jim
"How 'bout us? It's Meredith. By the way, your wife is a very lucky woman.",Meredith
Look. They're buying the company for the distribution. You guys are the only thing about this company that works. So congratulations.,David

"Dunder Mifflin is about to be sold. But first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch. And... I'm... pretty nervous about it. And... I'm... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment. Is that dishonest? Well, think of it this way: when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that I am applying to the office are the same ones that have made Lady Gaga a star... or any number of drag queens.",Michael

Hello.,Pam

"Hello, Stanley.",Michael
Hi.,Fake Stanley
"For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it.",Pam
"Uh, I just need to check out your warehouse and then talk to your HR guy. That is pretty much the only reason I'm here.",Eric
"Ok. Well, I thought I'd show you around a little bit -",Michael
Right.,Eric
"- since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper's Seafood. You like lobster? You've had lobster before, right?",Michael

They make the best Maine lobster in the world. You'll love it.,Michael

"No, Computron, actually I think Cooper's is the best. You're gonna love it.",Michael
Are you calling me wrong?,Computron
"[sighs] Oh, my God.",Michael
"It's called 'due diligence'. Basically, I confirm inventory, take a head count, see if there are any HR liabilities. I'm a glorified fact checker. Actually, I am a fact checker.",Eric
Alright. Excuse me. [slides past Eric to close the door to Ryan's closet office before Eric can see Ryan in there] If you will -,Michael
"Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -",Ryan

"Oh, we will. Have a seat. [Michael gives a pleased look then exits]",Dwight
"I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Toby's favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time.",Michael
"So, um, the manager, Michael Scott... is a bit of a character.",Eric
"He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?",Dwight
"What are, are you doing at my desk?",Toby
Ignore him. He's the local lunatic.,Dwight
"Come on, Dwight. Get out of here.",Toby
"Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. [laughs] Welcome. [Dwight exits]",Dwight
"Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help?",Toby
"Um, are there any outstanding liability issues to be aware of?",Eric
What do you mean?,Toby
"Well, safety issues, injuries that could leave the company open to potential lawsuits.",Eric
Um... nothing comes to mind. [clip montage],Toby
"So, the staff?",Eric

So... generally?,Eric
Yes.,Toby
Generally.,Eric
Generally happy. [clip montage],Toby

"[on the phone] Hey, uh, yeah, I finally got a chance to sit down with HR. So... well, I think I'm gonna be here for awhile.",Eric
This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive. [to Toby] Right? Would you agree with that?,Michael
"Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about.",Toby
"That's, that is true. [clip montage]",Michael
"[as Eric is being escorted out by Michael and Toby] Thank you, so much.",Dwight

Thank you. It's nice to meet you all.,Eric
Good to meet you.,Pam
Have a great day.,Angela
Hope to see you soon.,Dwight
Yeah.,Kevin
I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of... or Pam... or Kevin? [clip montage over Daryl's Dunder Mifflin jingle],Michael

"Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre. [mispronounced 'sob-ray'] They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses. Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didn't need them touching our asses.",Michael
"Oh! [rips open cardboard box] Wow. Awesome. [distributing items] For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you.",Michael

Cool. What next? [Dwight puts his face on scanner],Michael

Terrible mistake.,Dwight

Because we're usually not on the same page.,Pam
Okay. [starts round of applause],Michael
Oh. Okay. And to you. [begins applauding],Gabe
Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is.

"Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away.",Pam
"Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.",Jim
We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into.,Pam
"Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.",Jim
We're hoping our interview seals the deal.,Pam
"But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.",Jim
Okay. Okay. Yeah.,Pam
"So you've just been bought by Sabre. You've probably got a lot of questions. Hi. I'm Christian Slater. What's it like to work for Sabre? Let's find out together.

"Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?",Meredith
"Actually, that's Nick. He's your new IT guy. Uh, he's setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites. And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well.",Gabe
"Mm, nope. Don't like that.",Michael
"Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment.",Gabe
"We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right?",Michael
Little cups? Like paper or plastic or... ?,Gabe
I don't know what they're made of.,Michael
They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.,Dwight
"Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle.",Gabe
"You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.",Michael
That's ok.,Stanley
"There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company.

What?,Michael
Looks like we kicked it. [indicates water jug is empty],Toby
I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.,Michael
I don't want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre's doing for us.,Michael
"Oh, I don't get that sense at all from you, so...",Gabe
"Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I'm - I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em.",Michael
Which ones?,Gabe
All of them.,Michael
"Well, I wish that I could do something, but it's kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know?",Gabe
So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?,Michael
You know what? Let me see what I can do.,Gabe
"[after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.",Jim

"Well, I saw them in there.",Erin
"Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like, [imitating Italian accent] 'Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries.'",Andy
I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.,Erin
The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing.,Andy
"[on videochat] First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say, in just the way you wanted me to say it, so...",Gabe
"Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.",Jo
"Ok, um, I told the story of your uncle, and I have a feeling that you would have [Michael gesturing behind computer] really been proud of the way... Okay, um...",Gabe
"Wait a minute, who is it? Who's there? Is there somebody in the room with you? [Michael gesturing 'no'] I want to see who it is. Turn me around.",Jo
I don't - it's just...,Gabe

Hello. No. My name's Michael Scott. Hello.,Michael
"Oh, hello, Mr. Scott. Pleased to meet you.",Jo
Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.,Michael
"Aw, thank you. I've been working on it since I was a little girl. To, um, to what do I owe the pleasure of this videochat?",Jo
"Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -",Michael
"Pardon. Pardon me, Mr. Scott, but the last time I saw a company as mismanaged as Dunder Mifflin, it was my grandson's snowball company, so you'll excuse me if I prefer that you all adapt to the way that we do things.",Jo
Ok. I feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. He'd know what to do.,Michael
"So listen, why don't you tell Gabe if by the end of the day you can't handle the changes.",Jo
"I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.",Michael
I would take until the end of the day if I were you. [Michael leaves conference room],Jo

Good to see you. Come on in. My office is right back here. This is the play room.,Jerry
"This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -",Jim
"Oh, so you saw it already?",Jerry
"No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular.",Jim
It's lovely.,Pam
[cell phone rings] Oh. Got to take this. Sorry.,Jerry
Do it.,Jim
"Okay. Hi, this is Jerry.",Jerry
"Ok, you've got to pull it together.",Pam
We should just go. He's really uncomfortable.,Jim
He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.,Pam
What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?,Jim
That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.,Pam
Sorry about that. Right this way.,Jerry
All right.,Jim
"I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre. [rings doorbell] He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is? [loud drumming as door opens] Hey. Hi, sorry.",Michael
Michael.,David
I hope you're not busy doing something.,Michael
"No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on.",David
You sure?,Michael
You look great.,David
You look great too.,Michael
You hungry? I'm just having lunch.,David
"Oh, yeah, that sounds good.",Michael
"Fantastic. Teddy, look who just stopped in.",David
Huh? Hey. [continues drumming],Teddy Wallace
Hey. Wow.,Michael
"Keep it up, son.",David
Really loud.,Michael
"Wow. Oh, yummy. [David spreads marshmallow fluff on bread] You have got the life, my friend.",Michael
Yeah.,David
Can I just stay here and never go back?,Michael
Things not going so well there?,David
"Oh, man. How much time do you have?",Michael
I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday.,David
Yeah.,Michael
"Hey, honey. How's your day going? Did you do anything cool?",Mrs. Wallace
"Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out.",David
"Oh, 'cause I saw you had shoes on, so I didn't know if you did anything.",Mrs. Wallace
"No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael.",David
"Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see...",Michael
No problem at all. This is great. So what are you guys up to?,Mrs. Wallace
I don't know.,Michael
"Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. May -maybe we'll go outside. [drumming intensifies] Outside.",David
"There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.",Jim
"That seems a bit premature, don't you think? I don't even know if I have a space for you yet, and you're already lining up your holiday plans.",Jerry
"Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.",Jim
"Yeah, if the time comes, we can discuss it.",Jerry
Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?,Pam
What?,Jim
Seriously? You told her?,Jerry
Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.,Jim
And you - you thought that might have something to do with how the meeting is going?,Jerry
No.,Jim
"Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well.",Pam
"Well, you didn't consider the fact that it might not be going super well just because it might not be going super well?",Jerry
Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.,Pam
I'm being perfectly pleasant. Did you ever consider that you might not be as charming as you think you are?,Jerry
"Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?",Jim
It doesn't lock for the children's safety.,Jerry
Anybody could have walked in.,Jim
It was story time.,Jerry
"Sabre is changing everything. [Michael and David sitting in hot tub] Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?",Michael
"I don't know. I mean, what can you do?",David
Exactly. What are you thinking?,Michael
"I, I - It's a tough one.",David
It is a tough one.,Michael
I don't have any ideas for you there.,David
Yeah. But one would be good.,Michael
"Hey, oh, okay. Wait.",David
Okay.,Michael
I want to tell you about a business idea I have.,David
Okay.,Michael
"Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. It's like a shop-vac type of thing. [imitates vacuum] Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks. [sucking noise] Picks it up!",David
So the kid's making the noise to pick it up.,Michael
"No. No, no, no. That's the -that's the vacuum noise.",David
"Oh, okay.",Michael
You-you don't like it.,David
"No, I think it is-",Michael
"No, it's ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he's gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh... It's like shop-vac. [sucking noise] Did I say that?",David
Yep.,Michael
It'll be ok.,David
"Hey, any fun weekend plans?",Andy
"No, you?",Erin
"Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?",Andy
Nothing. It's wide open.,Erin
Okay.,Andy
That's as hard as I can hint.,Andy
"Hey, you know, if you want, I'm sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again.",David
The what?,Michael
Suck it. That's what it's called.,David
"Oh, okay.",Michael
Huh? Catchy. Kids'll love it.,David
Like it.,Michael
There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of 'em.,Michael
See you later. [hugs Wallace],Michael
"Oh, Michael.",David
Bye now.,Michael
Thank you for coming.,David
Thanks for having me.,Michael
"Well, that's not the David Wallace that I remember. [reverses out of driveway, Wallace follows him] That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.",Michael
"Hello. [comes in carrying 4 gallons of orange juice and his water bottle] Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go.",Michael
You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh.,Michael
"Well, I'm not really one for making speeches.",Michael
"Yes. Yes, you are. You make a lot.",Everyone
But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.,Michael
That's your toast?,Angela
No. This is my toast. I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.,Michael
"Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud.",Phyllis
"Here's my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good.",Michael
Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.,Kevin
Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.,Michael
To us and to Sabre.,All
"Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.",Michael
"[singing] Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.",David
Suck it!,Teddy
Yeah!,David
Suck it!,Teddy
Yeah!,David
Suck it!,Teddy
Yeah! Take out the Suck It and we'll...,David
Suck it!,Teddy
Yeah!,David
Suck it!,Teddy
Yeah!,David
Take out my Suck It and we'll suck it.,Both
Yeah! Teddy!,David
Yeah. [high-five each other],Teddy
"[on phone] Vancouver Court Hotel, how many I help you?",Hotel Employee
"Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America! I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics.",Michael
"Well, we are looking forward to having you, so, let me just pull up your information here...",Hotel Employee
Okey doke.,Michael
"Um, I don't seem to have it, sir.",Hotel Employee
What?,Michael
[looking through Michael's email] I'm not seeing anything under 'confirmation.',Dwight
No.,Michael
Could it be under 'affirmation?' Cause you have thousands of those.,Dwight
No. [to hotel employee on phone] We're trying to look it up right now.,Michael
You [i]did[/i] get the e-vite to my barbeque!,Dwight
"Um, come on.",Michael
Michael...,Dwight
"Uh, sir? A lot of people are trying to get last-minute reservations at hotels here for the Olympics, but we've been fully booked for months.",Hotel Employee
"Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.",Michael
"Wait, I got it! Confirmation code: XV2RDM!",Dwight
"...Oh, here it is. Yep.",Hotel Employee
Oh.,Michael
Thank you.,Dwight
Uh-huh. Seven nights in our street-view economy single?,Hotel Employee
That's it!,Michael
"Yeah, we changed it since it was a while back. I do apologize.",Hotel Employee
"Uh-huh, okay...",Michael and Dwight
"Yeah, how may I help you Mr. Scott?",Hotel Employee
"Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please.",Michael
"There is a cancellation fee for this, sir.",Hotel Employee
"Okay, put it on my card.",Michael
"Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?",Michael
"[Jo Bennett enters with two humongous dogs, everyone stands to welcome her except Dwight] Why hello!",Michael
"This is Michael Scott, co-regional manager of this branch.",Gabe
"Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett.",Michael
"Oh, that's Mrs. Bennett, sweetheart. My husband and I are divorced, but I kept the 'Mrs.' just to piss off the new wife. Well, let's take a gander around this place.",Jo
[Jo's dogs are sniffing at his crotch] These sure are pretty dogs...,Andy
They love a good crotch.,Jo
They sure do.,Andy
You should take that as a compliment!,Jo
"Oh, I do!",Andy
[to Dwight] Hello.,Jo
Hello.,Dwight
Do you always stay seated when a lady enters the room?,Jo
"I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.",Dwight
I like that.,Jo
This is Accounting.,Gabe
Hi!,Kevin
Good-looking group.,Jo
Over here is Meredith Palmer and Creed Bratton.,Gabe
Another couple of heartbreakers. Who is this tall drink of sun tea?,Jo
"That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office.",Gabe
[gesturing to Michael] I thought this guy was the manager?,Jo
"Oh, he is. He's the co-manager, and that's the other co-manager.",Gabe
Two guys doing one job? We gotta do something about that!,Jo
Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.,Andy
"[as Andy is passing her a card] No, no!",Angela
"What, no candy?",Kevin
"Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem 'too eager,' so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit.",Andy
"[throwing a card at Meredith, which skims her throat]: Look alive.",Andy
"Ow! Geez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat!",Meredith
"Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat.",Meredith
"Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.",Michael
"Whoa, whoa.",Jim
"Whoa, whoa!",Michael
"I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here: Michael handles more of the 'big-picture' stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...",Jim
Yeah. I think I understand.,Jo
Alright.,Jim
Each of you is doing half a job.,Jo
No.,Jim
And sometimes I can hardly handle that!,Michael
"This is knucklehead talk. I'm not gonna bite it, you know. You can't give me gravy and tell me it's jelly, because gravy ain't sweet! Is it, Jim?",Jo
I don't think so.,Jim
Michael?,Jo
Forget the question...,Michael
"I think one of you should return to sales, and the other one be manager.",Jo
I humbly accept the management position.,Michael
I... Why would you just say something like that?,Jim
"Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of folk: those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now.",Michael
Do you even know what that means?,Jim
Yes.,Michael
"Well, I'm gonna let this marinate. So you can go.",Jo
Um...,Jim
You can go on. Shoo!,Jo
"I'm Jolene Bennett, Jo for short. I'm a breast cancer survivor, close, personal friends with Nancy Pelosi, and Truman Capote and I slept with three of the same guys. When I was a little girl, I was terrified to fly, and now I have my own pilot's license. I am CEO of Sabre International, and I sell the best damn printers and all-in-one machines Korea can make. Pleased to meet you.",Jo
"[almost running into Erin] Whoa-oh, traffic jam!",Andy
"Uh-oh, traffic jam on route three!",Erin
[imitating car noises] Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep!,Andy
Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up!,Erin
"There's blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine's card.",Andy
"[opening card] Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!",Erin
"Yeah, well it's Snoopy and Woodstock.",Andy
You named them?,Erin
"Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?",Andy
"Uh, yeah I do remember. [reading card] Aw, they love each other.",Erin
"Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed.",Andy
"Wow, it smells really good too.",Erin
"Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.",Andy
"Andy, whoa! Thank you very much!",Erin
It's got pheromones in it.,Andy
Hey!,Jo
Hi.,Kevin
"[to Angela, who's having a hard time deciding on a chair] Just choosing seats, not getting married. Chop, chop little onion!",Jo
"Jo, there's books in my chair.",Kevin
"That's right, darlin', now you're the proud new owner of a Sabre handbook and my autobiography. Now, you all must be in a tizzy. I can see it on your faces, I mean, what's going on now? I mean, who owns Dunder Mifflin? Right? I mean, Sabre? What's that? Some company I've never heard of? Down in Tallahassee? Where is that? Near Mars?",Jo
"No, we know. Texas!",Michael
"Now Dunder Mifflin has an arm's reach in all these small businesses all over the northeast. Now we're gonna take that arm, and we're gonna start selling printers.",Jo
I could manage my way around that.,Michael
They're the easiest-to-use printers on the market.,Jo
I will try to manage my excitement!,Michael
"I have been saying the word 'manager' a lot, so whenever Jo thinks 'manager' she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a penis. I can't even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis. And vise-versa.",Michael
I think that's it. So we're all good! [many employees raise their hands] Thanks ya'll.,Jo
"[Jo leaves] I, uh...",Dwight
[reading her Valentine's card from Andy] Oh my God.,Kelly
"I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.",Kelly
"So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.",Pam
This is way more than I make now.,Jim
"I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.",Jim
"Hey, you got a second?",Jim
Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?,Michael
"Actually, yeah.",Jim
What?,Michael
Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.,Jim
What? Really?,Michael
Yeah!,Jim
Wow!,Michael
"La la la, hello Oscar!",Michael
Michael. Reading.,Oscar
What are you reading?,Michael
The Atlantic.,Oscar
"Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.",Michael
I should step into sales myself.,Oscar
"Why, is there an untapped gay market?",Michael
Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.,Oscar
...Where did you get that information.,Michael
Manual.,Oscar
Manuel who?,Michael
"Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.",Michael
Son of a bitch. [enters conference room] Pardon me.,Michael
"Oh, speak of the devil. We were just talking about you. Have a seat!",Jo
Okay.,Michael
Now Jim here is thinking about taking himself out of the running for being manager.,Jo
"Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.",Michael
Really?,Jo
Really.,Jim
"Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman.",Michael
"Well, I think you're both being a little too modest.",Jo
"No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.",Jim
"No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.",Michael
Why would you do that?,Jim
I'm turning myself in right now!,Michael
"You know, Michael, you have more experience in sales and management, so I'm gonna defer to your judgment.",Jo
Thank you.,Michael
"I think you [to Michael] will become the salesman, and congratulations! [to Jim] You're gonna be the new manager of this branch!",Jo
"Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.",Michael
"[pointing to the window in Michael's office] Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown!",Pam
Mm!,Jim
"[on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89... 88...",Dwight
You're twenty minutes late!,Dwight
"[walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster!",Ryan
Just admit you lost track of time.,Dwight
Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.,Dwight
Did you see Saw?,Ryan
Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.,Dwight
"No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?",Ryan
"Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.",Dwight
"Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.",Ryan
I like where you're going with this. Continue.,Dwight
Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?,Ryan
I have an old barn!,Dwight
Yes!,Ryan
"It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?",Dwight
"We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...",Ryan
"Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!",Dwight
Well suggest something else then! Don't just...,Ryan
He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!,Dwight
Don't just criticize my idea!,Ryan
Think!,Dwight
You think of something then!,Ryan
"Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.",Erin
How is that possible?,Michael
"Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.",Erin
"No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.",Michael
"You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager.",Erin
"Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? [Michael's phone rings] Michael Scott, head of sales.",Michael
"[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.",Jim
The new IT guy. Nick.,Dwight
Nick.,Ryan
"I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.",Dwight
Like Frodo!,Ryan
"Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?",Dwight
"Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.",Ryan
Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.,Dwight
I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.,Dwight
Who's hungry?,Erin
What is that?,Jim
It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say 'Who's hungry?',Erin
"Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though.",Jim
Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?,Erin
Why would I wanna do that?,Jim
"It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.",Erin
"For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...",Jim
Oh sure.,Erin
Yeah. Thank you.,Jim
Well.,Erin
"[on phone] It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye. [hangs up phone, blows train whistle] I just got a new account for the gentleman's club in Carbondale. It is called 'Curves.' I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it!",Michael
Nice!,Kevin
"You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.",Dwight
Why not? It's part of the sales experience.,Michael
It's not really 1992 anymore.,Dwight
"Well, okay...",Michael
"[reading Andy's card] You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.",Kelly
Geez louise.,Erin
"I know, obsessed with me much?",Kelly
"Well, everyone got one.",Erin
What did yours say?,Kelly
Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with.,Erin
"It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.",Erin
"Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.",Dwight
"Uh, yep.",Nick
"I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.",Dwight
"No, I actually don't.",Nick
"Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.",Dwight
I think that you should call the cops.,Nick
"No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.",Dwight
"I don't know what to tell you, man. I'm sorry, I just can't give out his password like that.",Nick
"Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.",Ryan
Are you... you threatening me?,Nick
"Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight crushes an apple]",Ryan
What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?,Michael
"Michael, stop.",Pam
"No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs?",Michael
Michael...,Pam
"You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.",Michael
"Michael, it's Phyllis.",Dwight
"No, this is geological.",Michael
I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on.,Phyllis
Are you kidding me?,Michael
No.,Phyllis
And you guys are okay with this?,Michael
"She sent an email, so.",Dwight
I did.,Phyllis
[has two tissues in his nostrils] It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed.,Andy
Oh my God.,Michael
Oh! You scared me!,Kelly
"I'm sorry, I thought you saw me.",Andy
"I didn't see you. And you were there all along. [takes papers out of copy machine] Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.",Kelly
"Cool, thanks.",Andy
"Bye, Andy. [kisses his cheek]",Kelly
...That was weird.,Andy
No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her.,Meredith
I don't even know what that card said.,Andy
"Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right... now.",Meredith
Hey.,Michael
Hey.,Jim
"You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here.",Michael
"Well, the grass is always greener.",Jim
Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch.,Michael
"Well, it's what you wanted.",Jim
I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.,Michael
"For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.",Jim
"We make a poster that says 'Happy Opposite Day!' and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.",Michael
"Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.",Jim
Lethal Weapon?,Michael
That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.,Jim
"You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don't need so much management?",Jo
What? What I'm saying...,Michael
"Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.",Jim
"And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys? [dogs go to him] See? They love me.",Michael
"Fine. I don't care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it.",Jo
Alright.,Jim
Alright!,Michael
"[cell phone rings] Oh, I gotta take this. Yep. Uh, finish walking my dogs for me. And don't ride 'em. Lotta people try to ride 'em.",Jo
"[Erin leaves room] Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message: 'Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way.'",Andy
You don't even like us as friends?,Phyllis
"Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you.",Andy
"What are we, five?",Oscar
"Please don't read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog.'",Andy
"[entering with Erin] Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?",Kelly
It's n-- that wasn't... I like someone else.,Andy
Who?,Kelly
"It's not... Whether or not, you...",Andy
"Who, what?",Kelly
"Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?",Erin
"Oh, it smells good in here.",Michael
"Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.",Erin
"Erin, what about my keyboard? [Erin hits a button on an electronic keyboard, playing a beat] Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?",Michael
"Oh! [hits another key, they awkwardly dance together]",Erin
[gesturing to Michael dancing in his office] He looks happy.,Pam
Yep.,Jim
"Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he [Jim dunks Dwight's tie in his coffee cup, Pam smiles] what? Michael!",Dwight
[entering elevator with Ryan] I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.,Dwight
"Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.",Ryan
"Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?",Dwight
"I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not?",Ryan
Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.,Dwight
"Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know.",Ryan
"It is not 'farm boy swill,' I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.",Dwight
I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!,Ryan
"[on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave... Yeah, I'm pregnant... Great, well, I'll write up the order. Okay, thanks.",Pam
Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales.,Dwight
"[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby? Oh, thank you very much. I'm excited. Oh, definitely.",Jim
"No, no! You need to come by your sales honorably!",Dwight
There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it.,Pam
"[on the phone with a client] Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ... Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay.",Dwight
"I need a baby. I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life. Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.",Dwight
"Kevin, you're such a gourmand.",Pam
"I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook. Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.",Kevin
Hmm.,Pam
"Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot. Not all meals. Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.",Kevin
I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast.,Kevin
"Mmmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking?",Pam
I think it should be a surprise.,Kevin
"[After Pam has a contraction] Oh, getting there, huh?",Meredith
"No, no. I still have time.",Pam
"I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.",Pam
"Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.",Jim
"If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.",Pam
"Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it. And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.",Jim
I cannot wait for that joke to be over.,Pam
Ooh.,Pam
"Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car...",Michael
Michael.,Jim
"Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.",Michael
"Michael, you shouldn't have done that.",Jim
"Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.",Michael
"You know the baby's not going to live here, right?",Pam
"Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.",Michael
"Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here. Burning man, port-o-potty.",Jim
"Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital!",Michael
"Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight.",Pam
"Ooh, spooky. But why?",Erin
Because the insurance company only covers two nights.,Jim
Everything's fine. We have plenty of time.,Pam
"Well, you don't want to wait too long, Pam. Otherwise the baby's going to become a teenager in there and you'll be up all night, from the rock music.",Nick
"Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I.T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd.",Michael
[as Nick looks over at her] What are you looking at?,Angela
"Ha, nerd.",Dwight
"Did you know that labor can last weeks? Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.",Kelly
[with Angela in the break room] Bare my child.,Dwight
Excuse me?,Angela
"I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother. If you agree, say nothing. If you disagree, say anything... Very well. Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.",Dwight
[after Pam has another contraction] That's seven minutes. Here we go. This is happening. Come on.,Jim
"Hold on, hold on. It isn't midnight yet.",Pam
Are you serious? Pam.,Jim
"No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.",Pam
"I... Pam, please.",Jim
"I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.",Pam
"Yeah, no, you really should. Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks. My old roommate.",Andy
Did you hear that? Butt-mud Brooks.,Pam
"Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.",Jim
Five minutes apart.,Pam
"So, the plan was seven minutes. But we're calling an audible, because that's her call. Because she's the quarterback. I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.",Jim
"Okay, stop watching me.",Pam
"Okay, crazy. I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.",Jim
Mm-hmm.,Pam
"Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal. While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?",Jim
Not until midnight.,Pam
"Guys. Word of advice. Speaking as a former baby. Don't get too hung up on baby names. I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.",Andy
I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.,Erin
"My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.",Andy
"You know, it's getting real crowded in here. Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.",Jim
"No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.",Michael
"[as Andy and Kevin shout 'yeah!' in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.",Jim
"Actually, the distractions are good. I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.",Pam
"Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes! No, no, five seconds! Right now, right now! Conference room! Topic, potpourri! Let's go!",Michael
"Um, I am sort of a master of distraction. When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class. Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. [Michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises.]",Michael
The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.,Michael
Can we do sleight of hand tricks?,Andy
I will allow that.,Michael
Yes! Can anyone do those?,Andy
I'm going to go look at the Internet.,Stanley
"[as Pam has another contraction] Oh! Oh, alright. That's a good one.",Jim
"Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys. Just, um, keep talking.",Pam
Okay.,Michael
"Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.",Kelly
"Oh, thanks, Kelly.",Pam
"Does anybody have anything? Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?",Michael
"Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.",Pam
"Yes, Phyl?",Michael
I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.,Phyllis
"[ as Pam shakes her head] Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that.",Michael
I can do the evolution of dance-dance.,Andy
"[as Pam gives the thumbs up] That sounds good! Do you need some music, or...? Okay.",Michael
"Nope, actually music would just throw me off. I need complete silence. Okay... [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances] You're clapping. I need complete silence. Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over. Evolution of dance-dance.",Andy
"[reading from a book as Kelly admires] 'You let me in your bed. But now, I sleep alone. Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.'",Ryan
[naming race horses] Affirmed. Seattle Slew. Secretariat. Citation. Assault. Count Fleet. Rollaway. War Admiral. Omaha. Gallant Fox... And... I know this. Uh... The jockey was Johnny Loftus. Sired by Star Shoot.,Erin
Good afternoon.,Angela
Have a seat.,Dwight
What is this?,Angela
"Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.",Dwight
Of course.,Angela
It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.,Dwight
You know I was thinking...,Angela
"Now, then. Let's get to it, shall we? Item one: [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus. Agreed?",Dwight
Agreed.,Angela
"[as Pam has another contraction] Where are we? We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.",Michael
"For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!",Kevin
"Okay, you know what? I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call. He'd probably know...",Jim
"Jim, please. Happy thoughts here. Happy times.",Pam
"Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times.",Michael
Alright.,Jim
"Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor. And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one.",Michael
"Um, stimulate the nipples.",Erin
"Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.",Michael
Her shirt is touching them. Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.,Kevin
I have a shirt like that in my car.,Meredith
"Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?",Michael
"Okay, uh, the second one is walk around. We're already doing the opposite of that. Perfect. Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.",Erin
"Okay, the opposite of that?",Michael
Stick spicy food up her butt.,Kevin
"Nope, nope, nope, nope. Come on, let's go to the hospital. Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.",Jim
"Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.",Pam
"Mm-hmm. Okay, great. Well, sorry.",Jim
Why don't you go do some work?,Pam
"Great. I will do that. Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled. And you know how very rarely I use that word. Frazzled.",Jim
"I know, you don't like to be frazzled.",Pam
"No, I don't.",Jim
Okay.,Pam
"Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now. Totally.",Jim
"Ooh, someone's freakin'.",Michael
A little frazzled.,Andy
I think he is.,Michael
"I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy, she's crazy. I'm not crazy, she's crazy. [reading from various books] Five to seven minutes. Five to seven minutes. Six minutes. Different, but not really. Five to seven minutes.",Jim
Acceptable names include and are limited to: Ebenezer.,Dwight
Jedediah.,Angela
Jonas.,Dwight
Jedediah.,Angela
Warf.,Dwight
No Star Trek names.,Angela
Okay. Fine.,Dwight
What if it's a girl?,Angela
"Irrelevant question. Section 5A, child shall be male.",Dwight
Hey. Uh-uh. I cannot control that. You can't put that in here.,Angela
Yes you can.,Dwight
No.,Angela
"It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.",Dwight
Absolutely not.,Angela
[Pam approaches as he sits in his car] Hey.,Jim
"Hey. I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital.",Pam
"Ah, you know me too well.",Jim
"Okay, Jim.",Pam
Yeah? ... Oh.,Jim
"Everything is fine. You don't have to worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay?",Pam
Did you say 'she?',Jim
"I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn't wait... Oh, God, don't be mad.",Pam
Mad? How could I be mad? We're having a little girl.,Jim
Mm-hmm.,Pam
"Wow, we're having a little girl. Oh, man.",Jim
I know.,Pam
"Woo, alright. Well, I definitely feel better.",Jim
Good.,Pam
Yeah.,Jim
Okay.,Pam
"Alright... Hey, did you change?",Jim
"Oh, yeah, my water broke.",Pam
Oh. Oh...,Jim
"[enters the office and has another contraction] Oh, whoa. Ha. Wow.",Pam
"Pam, Pam! Okay, alright, okay, it's time. Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please! Is it midnight yet?",Michael
"No, it's 4:35.",Phyllis
"4:35. Alright, almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn't have sex like seven and a half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let's go to the hospital, shall we?",Michael
"No, not yet, Michael.",Pam
We can do...,Michael
"Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast! Where's Kevin?",Pam
Oh. What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?,Michael
That's fancy feast. Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.,Oscar
What is October feast?,Michael
"There is no rush to get to the hospital. I am fine. I'll get there. And if I don't get there, I don't get there.",Pam
"Our ultra feast menu's theme: Hollywood. We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels. I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I... Are you okay?",Kevin
"Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm fine. Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.",Pam
"Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital.",Michael
Alright. Time to go. Okay.,Jim
"That's right, let's do this.",Michael
Let's give it a shot.,Jim
"Nope. No, no, that's better. That wasn't even the worst of them. I'm fine.",Pam
"Hey, come on. Let's go to the hospital.",Jim
"They're not that bad still, babe.",Pam
"Pam, Pam, it's time. Let's go to the hospital.",Jim
"No, it's passing, it's fine. It's okay.",Pam
"Come on, Michael says we should go now.",Jim
"Let's go, Pam. Yeah, I think we should head out.",Michael
"No, it's passing, it's fine.",Pam
Pam.,Jim
"Ah, no, it passed. It's good.",Pam
You know what? Let's go. We got to go to the hospital.,Jim
"Okay, I'm not going. I'm not... It's fine. [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on. No! I am not going! I am not going, okay!? I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.",Pam
"Hey, are you kidding me?",Jim
Are you kidding?,Michael
"If anyone can do this, you can do this.",Jim
You can do this. You can do this.,Michael
"Pam, I'm scared. I'm real scared.",Jim
"I'm scared, too.",Michael
I'm petrified.,Kevin
"The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.",Jim
Yeah.,Michael
A really awesome baby.,Jim
We're going to have a baby.,Michael
So let's have it at the hospital.,Jim
Let's do that.,Michael
How are we doing on contractions?,Jim
Two minutes apart.,Michael
Two minutes...,Jim
"Oh, God. Oh, no.",Pam
"Michael, I told you.",Jim
It's okay.,Michael
"No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.",Jim
"Jim, we waited too long!",Pam
"I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon.",Michael
"We waited too long! Two minutes doesn't do us any good. Well, what happened to four and three minutes?",Jim
"We're okay, Jim! Okay, Pamela. You know what time it is?",Michael
I don't want to have my baby here.,Pam
You're not going to. You know where you're going?,Michael
The hospital.,Pam
"Yes, you are. And you know what you're going to have?",Michael
A baby.,Pam
Yes! We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.,Michael
"I got it! I got it! Everybody it's go time! At your stations. Stanley, man the phones. Meredith, please, get bottled water. Erin, call an ambulance, please!",Michael
"No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops.",Dwight
"Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually.",Jim
"No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it.",Michael
"Alright, I have my wallet.",Jim
Yes.,Michael
"Go bag's in the car... Keys, my keys, where's my keys?",Jim
Go bag! Where's my go bag? Where's my go bag?,Michael
There's nothing in it.,Erin
"You are telling me now that there is nothing in it. Okay, great! Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?",Michael
"The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!",Oscar
Has anyone checked how dilated she is? This is ridiculous!,Dwight
"Dwight, get away!",Pam
"No, no, no. Dwight, let Jim do that, please.",Michael
I didn't know we had a tape measure.,Erin
[as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] 'We' don't.,Dwight
"Okay, I can't find my keys! I cannot find my keys! Found 'em. They're here.",Jim
Here we go!,"Dwight, Jim and Michael"
Good luck!,Phyllis
"Good luck, Pam!",Nick
Thank you! Wish me luck!,Michael
Have fun! [sigh],Creed
"Hey, it's 5:00!",Meredith
[entering the elevator] Here we go! Here we go! On our way!,Michael
Hold it!,Stanley
"Come on, Stanley! Okay. We're going now!",Michael
"Oh, one more!",Toby
"No, no, no, no! Out, out! Idiot.",Michael
"Dwight, what is the traffic like?",Michael
Doesn't matter. I'll escort you!,Dwight
Alright.,Michael
Let's go!,Dwight
"Geesh, Dwight!",Michael
[as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!,Dwight
What!?,Michael
This is where I saw that deer last week.,Dwight
Where?,Michael
Right over by that fence.,Dwight
By the bushes?,Michael
"Okay, Michael! Focus!",Jim
"Okay, go, go, go, go!",Michael
Let's go!,Dwight
"I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends.",Dwight
"Alright, here we go! You're doing great! She'll be here soon.",Jim
"Okay, just breathe... She? You found out? Come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised.",Michael
Michael!,Pam
Yeah?,Michael
"Stop texting, put your phone away! Come on.",Pam
"Michael, come on!",Jim
"I'm texting about you, okay!?",Michael
"Ugh, alright. [as he puts a police siren on top of his car] Let's move! ... What?",Dwight
Pull over!,Policeman
Are you kidding me?,Dwight
"Pull over! [Dwight begins throwing various weapons out of the window] You're not allowed to impersonate a police officer! Don't make this difficult, Dwight!",Policeman
"Wait, wait. My iPod's not in here!",Pam
Okay.,Jim
It has the birth song on it!,Pam
"Okay. I know, I know. But my iPod is in the go bag. We'll be fine.",Jim
"Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.",Pam
"Okay, so what do you want to do?",Jim
I don't know! Let's go by the house and get it. It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!,Pam
"Pam, no! Are you nuts? We're going to the hospital now.",Jim
"Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go. [as he calls Dwight] Ready?",Michael
Dwight Schrute.,Dwight
"Hello, Dwight. Pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday.",Michael
Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday? I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.,Dwight
Okay.,Michael
Dwight! Go to my house. Get my iPod. I think it's on the kitchen table. Do not touch anything else. The key is under...,Pam
I don't need a key.,Dwight
"Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the...",Pam
"No, no, don't, don't tell me. Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.",Dwight
Dwight just listen! It's underneath... [Dwight hangs up as the policeman hands him a ticket],Pam
Okay.,Michael
"Wait, you alright?",Jim
Yes.,Pam
"Do you have everything, guys?",Michael
"Michael, just go park the car.",Jim
"Okay, alright. [he parks in an ambulance zone]",Michael
Sir! You can't park here!,Hospital employee
Dunder-Mifflin. It's okay. [he throws the keys into bushes across the street] I just did.,Michael
"Pam's doing great. Uh, she's ten inches dilated now. Uh, sorry, meters. Centimeters. And she's also fully faced. Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet. It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.",Jim
Daddy? She's ready to push.,Nurse
Okay.,Jim
"Where is my little nibblet? Halpert, room D1. Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you. Here we go.",Michael
"[as Pam screams] Doing great, push again.",Jim
Not yet.,Doctor
"No, don't push. Pull. Pull.",Jim
Why don't you get more ice chips?,Nurse
"No, Jim, stay!",Pam
"Okay. Really push this time, Pam.",Doctor
Okay.,Pam
"[looking horrified as he walks from the room back into the lobby] Okay, not yet, not yet. I'm going to go wash my eyes.",Michael
That kid's going to have a lot of hair.,Michael
"Hey, have you guys seen her?",Andy
She hasn't popped yet.,Meredith
What? God damn it. She was supposed to come out yesterday.,Andy
"I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born. This frame set me back fifty five bones. But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper.",Andy
This is ridiculous. We just can't wait here.,Phyllis
I think it's going to be any minute now.,Michael
"But you don't know that. I mean, we could be here another half an hour.",Phyllis
"Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?",Michael
I have an ice cream cake in the car.,Phyllis
"Oh, my God. Go, go, go! Are you insane? Alright.",Michael
"[Pam screams as he approaches the door to their room] Guys? Hello? Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...",Michael
This is happening!,Pam
"You're starting, you're kinda losing them.",Michael
"Oh, my God! Look at her! baby, she's so beautiful! Oh, my God.",Jim
"Oh, my God.",Pam
"[smoking a cigar] Yeah, that's right. It's a baby, see?",Michael
"Sir! Sir, you can't smoke that in here. Put it, put it out.",Doctor
Okay. You can't smoke anywhere these days.,Michael
"[with Jim, holding the baby] She's incredible. Want to count her fingers and toes again?",Pam
"No, let's let her rest. I'm sure there's still twelve on each.",Jim
Okay.,Pam
"Guys, guys!",Michael
Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.,Jim
Eleven pounds...,Michael
"She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches. Mother and daughter are doing great.",Jim
Yeah!,Everyone
Thank you! Thank you!,Michael
Congratulations. That's great.,Oscar
Hi there.,(Pam's mom) Heleen
"Hey, grandma's back.",Jim
"Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee.",Helene
Great.,Jim
"Oh, thank God. I haven't had caffeine in nine months.",Pam
"Ooh, somebody has a full diaper.",Helene
Oh. Let me get it.,Jim
I am a diapering master. I have done little else in the past two months. There is nothing I cannot diaper. Go ahead. Try to think of something. I dare you.,Jim
"Where's the baby? I want to see the baby. Oh! Oh, Helene, hi. Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this? Congratulations on being a grandma.",Michael
"Hello, Michael.",Helene
"Hello. Oh, good for you. I worry about you.",Michael
"I'm, uh... You know I think, uh, I think it's time for me to go.",Helene
Okay.,Pam
Love you.,Helene
"Love you, as a friend.",Michael
"Love you, mom.",Pam
"Ooh, I want to hold the baby!",Michael
"Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.",Pam
Alright.,Michael
"Again, no pants.",Pam
"Oh, okay.",Michael
Ready?,Jim
"Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael.",Michael
"It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.",Jim
"Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod. I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it. What I did find, was mold, and lots of it. So, I did what anyone would do. Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it. I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets... Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].",Dwight
"There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able. I made a family! I got these two together, and I made a family.",Michael
This man has a gift!,Andy
Who else here is single?,Michael
I'm not single. I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single],Kelly
"I am offering up my services to you all. You saw what I did with Pam and Jim. I can help you, too.",Michael
Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?,Stanley
"Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any? [Stanley raises his hand] Who else? Come on! People, I know models!",Michael
"Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.",Ryan
"Ha ha, you got that right! Meredith? Come on, you're obviously single.",Michael
You know it. I am never getting married.,Meredith
Like Clooney.,Meredith
"Andrew, what about you?",Michael
"Torn scrotum. Still on the mend, so not good timing.",Andy
"Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin. I'm just waiting for the stars to align. Literally. I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.",Andy
"Well, when you least expect it, expect it. I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love. I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person. And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.",Michael
Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?,Pam
We were just kids. What did we know?,Jim
How we doing?,Nurse
Great.,Jim
Good.,Pam
Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?,Nurse
Doesn't she sleep here?,Pam
She can. But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest. You've been through a lot.,Nurse
I think we'll be okay.,Jim
"Okay, great.",Nurse
"[as the baby yawns] Oh, big yawn.",Pam
"Ready? One, two, three...",Jim
"One, and then wrap around. It's okay. Hold that arm down.",Pam
"I can't. She's too strong. She's, careful, though. You don't want to break it.",Jim
She's not gonna... Just...,Pam
I got it. Alright.,Jim
Go.,Pam
Nurse!,Jim
How you doing?,Jim
"I don't know. I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything.",Pam
Really?,Jim
Doesn't feel right.,Pam
"Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?",Jim
How does one do that?,Pam
Wasn't it... It's kinda like a... Like that.,Jim
"Do you want to try it, Jim?",Pam
I think you're good. Doing a good job.,Jim
Somebody buzzed?,Nurse
"Oh! Really? Must have sat on it, Pam.",Jim
I can't tell if she's getting anything. It just doesn't really feel right.,Pam
"Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while. I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later.",Nurse
Even if she's not getting anything?,Pam
"Yeah, she'll be fine. I can always give her a bottle since we're in the nursery.",Nurse
No. I read in the book about nipple confusion.,Pam
"Oh, good. You know everything.",Nurse
"She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.",Pam
"Well, I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay?",Nurse
Alright.,Jim
Alright.,Nurse
It's going to be alright.,Jim
Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.,Pam
"Ha ha. No, yeah, that will be good.",Jim
[in Michael's office] You wanted to see me?,Erin
"What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?",Michael
"Oh, boy! ... What's that sound?",Erin
[as he appears from behind the door] Ta-da!,Kevin
I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.,Michael
Yes!,Kevin
I don't know what to say.,Erin
"Oh, say nothing. You will learn to love me.",Kevin
"Okay, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth. Why don't you guys get to know each other? Maybe have lunch together?",Michael
"Erin, would you have lunch with me?",Kevin
Okay.,Erin
Good!,Michael
Yes!,Kevin
"Michael, could I talk to you privately?",Erin
"Sure. Kevin, please leave.",Michael
Bye.,Kevin
Bye.,Michael
"I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not. I like Andy.",Erin
Okay. This is going to kill Kevin.,Michael
I'm sure he'll be fine.,Erin
"I'm not so sure. Kevin has an enormous heart. Literally, he has an elephant heart. He had a transplant when he was seventeen. Had some problems, blah blah blah.",Michael
Really?,Erin
"No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart. But he is very sensitive. And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him... I bet his heart is enlarged, though.",Michael
I don't want anyone to die.,Erin
Just don't let him sit on you... I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him.,Michael
Hi.,Kevin
Hi.,Erin
She touched my shoulder.,Kevin
"Hey, guys. We're short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy.",Nurse
"Oh, hi.",Jim
Hi.,Kathy
"Hi, so sorry.",Dale
"Careful... Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.",Jim
I know.,Pam
You see that? I'm pretty sure she's... Hi.,Jim
Did you grow up around here?,Erin
No.,Kevin
"So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?",Erin
Yes.,Kevin
"Why was I hiding behind the plant? Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class. Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class. And then, uh, they would say things like 'Oh, this guy's going to fail this class,' or, 'What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?' And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, 'Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people? Busted.' ... Oh, the reason? The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and... I was jealous.",Andy
"Uh, hi, Pam Halpert?",Hospital employee
Yes?,Pam
Hi. I'm Clark. Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant.,Hospital employee
"Um, yeah, that would be great.",Pam
Yup. Really great. When's she available?,Jim
"Actually, uh, I'm the consultant. Got milk? Ha ha. Alright, let's see what we're working with.",Clark
"So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...",Pam
I'll get that for you.,Clark
"Oh, thank you. Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing. I don't know if she's getting anything.",Pam
Okay. Let me feel here.,Clark
Okay.,Pam
"Yeah, it's quite full. Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand.",Clark
Okay.,Pam
"When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C. Uh, does that hurt?",Clark
"No, I mean, it feels... pressure.",Pam
Okay.,Clark
Are you sure it doesn't hurt?,Jim
No. It just feels like pressure.,Pam
"Okay, well. Feel how I'm flicking the nipple? Like that?",Clark
Yup.,Jim
Stimulate it.,Clark
Yeah.,Jim
"Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh...",Clark
Perfect.,Jim
And you can just... The baby should grab on to that.,Clark
I think she will.,Jim
"Okay. So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though. I'm not sure if...",Pam
We'll figure it out.,Jim
It doesn't... Why don't you bring your baby over here... She's beautiful.,Clark
"Okay. Aw, thank you.",Pam
"Yes, congratulations.",Clark
Thank you.,Jim
"Well, you're doing a good job. Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you. Okay?",Clark
Okay.,Pam
Please do.,Jim
"Oh, shoot.",Pam
What?,Jim
"Shoot, she fell off.",Pam
"Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.",Jim
"Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?",Pam
No need. I saw him do it. I can try it.,Jim
"Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.",Pam
"Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.",Jim
"[on the phone] Hey, what's up, kid?",Dwight
Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?,Angela
"Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts. Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?",Dwight
I look forward to it.,Angela
Very well.,Dwight
Goodbye.,Angela
"[trying to sleep as the baby cries] Jim, Jim, get her.",Pam
Hmm?,Jim
Get the baby. Get her. Come on.,Pam
Okay. Sshh. I know. [hands the baby to Pam],Jim
I got her. Okay. Okay. Okay... Jim! She latched! She latched.,Pam
That's amazing.,Jim
"Oh, my God. I didn't even have to do the 'C thing.'",Pam
That's awesome.,Jim
"Aw, we're doing it.",Pam
that's great.,Jim
We're really parents now.,Pam
Mm-hmm.,Jim
Kevin. Erin would like a few words with you.,Michael
Hey.,Erin
Hi.,Kevin
I have really enjoyed our time together.,Erin
"Yeah, me too.",Kevin
I want to continue working on our friendship.,Erin
"Really, really fun.",Kevin
Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.,Erin
"Yeah, me too.",Kevin
"And, you're my friend.",Erin
Yeah.,Kevin
"And I hope that I'm your friend... And, maybe...",Erin
Yeah.,Kevin
"Oh, my God, this is agonizing. Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?",Michael
You said she liked me.,Kevin
"Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin. And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place.",Michael
I've dumped better than Erin.,Kevin
No.,Michael
"Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.",Kevin
Lynn was as hot as Erin.,Michael
"Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.",Kevin
"This isn't about me, and that is debatable. And I have a personality, where as you... Yes, Andy?",Michael
[he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant] Ow.,Andy
Kev... Nice. Going.,Michael
Well...,Erin
Knock knock.,Isabelle
"Oh, hey, Isabelle.",Pam
Hey.,Jim
"Hey. Pam, she's gorgeous. Can I hold her?",Isabelle
"Yes. She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down. Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her. I don't want her to spit up on you. Come here, sweety... Oh, my God! Wrong baby!",Pam
What?,Jim
Wrong baby! This is not our baby! Sshh.,Pam
"Okay, okay.",Jim
"Oh, my gosh.",Pam
"[waking up] Oh,has she been fussing long?",Kathy
"No, not at all.",Pam
Perfect.,Jim
"I was out like a light... Oh, she's not hungry...",Kathy
How's it going?,Nurse
"Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...",Pam
Ha ha ha.,Jim
Bottles are fine. A lot of babies grow up using bottles. So are you excited to bring your baby home?,Nurse
"We definitely are. At 3:00, right? You said we could stay until 3:00?",Jim
"Yeah, you can. It's 2:35.",Nurse
Half hour.,Jim
Twenty five minutes. And you're all set with the car seat?,Nurse
"Yes, car seat's right there.",Jim
That bottom part needs to go in the car.,Nurse
"Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.",Jim
"Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes.",Nurse
"Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be... Can we get a late checkout? I don't... I don't think she heard me.",Jim
"[entering the Halpert house] Hello? Dwight? What, what are you doing here?",Isabelle
"Isabelle. Hello... Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...",Dwight
"Wow, ha. New cabinets.",Isabelle
Yup.,Dwight
All I did was bring macaroni and cheese... Where's the fridge?,Isabelle
"Oh, it's... In the backyard. I'll take this.",Dwight
"Oh... Well, I'll let you get back to it.",Isabelle
"Hey, listen. I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning. You know, just for fun.",Dwight
"Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too.",Isabelle
"Are they now? Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right? Ha ha.",Dwight
Yeah...,Isabelle
"Alright. I'll call you, kid.",Dwight
Do that.,Isabelle
Are you really sure we should be leaving?,Jim
Yeah.,Hospital employee
"But you hear the baby crying, right?",Jim
Mm-hmm... Where's your car?,Hospital employee
"Uh, it's in the lot.",Jim
"Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around.",Hospital employee
"Right, okay. Yes, that would be the smart thing to do. Uh, Pam, I will be right back.",Jim
"Okay, please hurry.",Pam
"Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately. It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.",Andy
"Okay, good.",Erin
"The fax says 'Erin, will you have dinner with me?' from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.",Andy
"It's busy. Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?",Erin
"Sorry, that's unacceptable. I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired.",Andy
[tearing up] You can't talk to me like that. I didn't do anything wrong. I've been having a tough day today.,Erin
"Oh, God, no. I'm... Just read the fax.",Andy
You read the fax.,Erin
I'm... I'm asking you out.,Andy
"Oh, my God. That's amazing. Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.",Erin
"So, it's a date.",Andy
Yes. Do you have a day in mind?,Erin
"Yeah, what day? What day?",Andy
Everyday is fine. Or...,Erin
"Well, that, what's that one?",Andy
Thursday?,Erin
Okay. Let's do it.,Andy
Okay.,Erin
Would you like me to help you up out of the chair?,Hospital employee
"Oh, yeah, sorry.",Pam
"Yeah, we just got a lot of discharges today.",Hospital employee
"Okay, alright, thanks... Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay... Okay, let me... Just you and me. Come on. There we go... Yeah... Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it.",Pam
Five tickets on the windshield... Hey.,Jim
Hi. We did it.,Pam
"You used my move, didn't you?",Jim
I used a variation of your move.,Pam
"[smoking a cigar] There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love. And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today... I think I'm going to be sick...",Michael
"Two forms of ID, please.",Dwight
"And now you, two forms of ID, please... Alright, all is in order. I just need your signature... What is it?",Angela
Nothing.,Dwight
Alright. How would you like to celebrate?,Angela
Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice. I feel sick... [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby] I couldn't find the iPod... Give me a couple days. I'll be out of your hair.,Dwight
Hello hello. Top of the morning to you! Ooh ooh! Green M&Ms! Nature's Viagra! [Grabs and pours Kevin-esque scoop of M&Ms into his coat pocket] Two of my favorite joke areas combined. It'll be a good day.,Michael
"I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?",Kelly
"Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.",Ryan
Well why don't you invite your friends?,Kelly
Why are you being so weird about this?,Ryan
"Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids.",Meredith
Why no kids?,Ryan
"Yeah, where are your kids?",Kelly
Nope. Nuh -uh. Not today!,Meredith
"It is St. Patrick's Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.",Michael
"Welcome back, 'Dad!'",Erin
"Oh, thank you!",Jim
Hey!,Phyllis
Hey!,Stanley
Welcome back Tuna!,Andy
Hey... [reveal Dwight's Mega-Desk],Jim
"Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.",Dwight
What do we got here?,Jim
Mega-Desk.,Dwight
Of course.,Jim
Command central.,Dwight
Hm hm.,Jim
"Surveillance, gaming- and business.",Dwight
Okay. [Pulls desks apart] Just gotta...,Jim
Okay. Come on! Jim!,Dwight
"Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.",Dwight
"Oh, I love this, so much fun! There's such team spirit in this room! 'Morning Darling!",Jo
Morning!,Jim
"Well, this is my last day at the Scranton branch for a while. But I'm leaving it in the very capable hands of some of the loveliest people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. Oh I'm gonna miss this place. And the snow! Hoo, my dogs love peeing in that snow! Makes me think they're onto something.",Jo
Oh good morning sweetheart.,Jo
"Morning, honey-pile.",Michael
I'm sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands?,Jo
It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.,Michael
[pulls out glass cube with coal.] Is that a lump of coal?,Jo
Yes it is!,Michael
Have I been that naughty?,Jo
"No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.",Michael
"Err, thank you very much. We, we don't get to see much coal in Tallahassee, I'm used to alligators, and some of the worst Chinese food you've ever tasted.",Jo
"Mm, that sounds great, actually.",Michael
"Well, if you ever get down in my neck of the woods, you got a place to stay.",Jo
"When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!",Michael
Erin go braugh!,Andy
Andy go braugh to you! Nice kilt!,Erin
Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt.,Andy
"Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to 'How I Met Your Mother' that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them.",Andy
No. [re-enters bullpen from kitchen.],Jim
Great.,Dwight
No.,Jim
Thank you. [hangs up phone],Dwight
No-no-no-no-no.,Jim
Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?,Dwight
"[swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?",Jim
They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!,Dwight
Good Lord! [Photo of Cece on Jim's desktop] I can't believe I'm missing this.,Jim
"It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic.",Pam
Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone],Jim
"Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?",Dwight
It is. Big time.,Jim
"Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.",Dwight
Pretty amazing.,Jim
"What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.",Dwight
Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.,Jim
"I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.",Dwight
Is that what happened to you?,Jim
"I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.",Dwight
That's a common mistake.,Jim
"Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.",Dwight
Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?,Angela
"Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion.",Erin
In your nose?,Angela
Yes. [Angela returns to desk and puts embroidered breathing mask on],Erin
"I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.",Erin
"Now, after all the talking I've been doing. It's your turn. This is a town hall meeting. I want to hear what you all sound like.",Jo
That is a great idea JB.,Michael
"Thank you. You know I get way too many ideas from the top. Now I want to hear your ideas. I mean, did you guys know that Liquid Paper? That wasn't invented by some fancy engineer. No, that was created by a lowly typist.",Jo
"Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap.",Kevin
You know it doesn't have to be an invention.,Jo
I have a question.,Oscar
"Oscar, homosexual accountant.",Michael
"In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?",Oscar
"I am so proud of Sabre's 'Print In All Colors' initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply. [Kelly applauds] Daryl?",Jo
"Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse...",Michael
Okay hush now.,Jo
Okay.,Michael
"The Sabre shipping method could be more efficient. Combining inventory systems makes sense on paper, but printers and paper ship differently. It'll be faster to deliver them separately, instead of waiting on everything to come in.",Daryl
But you wouldn't need more trucks?,Jo
Not at all. There's a way that it can be scheduled. I sketched this out downstairs.,Daryl
Oh look at you.,Jo
"Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We're very proud of you. You know what, we're gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.",Michael
[Looks over his proposal] I like this Daryl. I like this a lot. Maybe you should be doing your sketching upstairs. Would you like an office up here?,Jo
Are you serious?,Daryl
Yeah. Take Jim's old office.,Jo
Um. I set my stuff up in there. So... just give me a few minutes to clean that out for you.,Gabe
"Yeah, I want to hear more from you.",Jo
Absolutely.,Daryl
All right.,Jo
Thank you.,Daryl
"Okay. Any questions? Anything on anybody's mind? I'm leaving tonight, this is your last chance for a while!",Jo
"Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much!",Michael
"Yes, well okay. Florida ain't that far away.",Jo
"Well, I am heading down there.",Michael
"Well, anytime now.",Jo
How about July 4th weekend? [Reveals paper ticket],Michael
Oh honey you didn't buy a ticket?,Jo
I did!,Michael
"Oh honey. I'm not home, very often. And uh, me and my relatives, they take up the guesthouse. I think you should check with my office, before you book any dates, okay?",Jo
"You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -",Michael
Enough!,Jo
"All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.",Michael
Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm.,Michael
"[singing] Moving on up, to the East Side, to the deluxe apartment in the sky...",Daryl
"Hello. I want you to stop what you're doing right now. You are stressed, and I'm taking you to lunch.",Michael
"No, that's very generous of you, but I'm all set.",Jo
No is not an option.,Michael
Yes it is.,Jo
"All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.",Michael
How many knocks does it take to get you to do some work?,Jo
[laughs] I'll be over there.,Michael
And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.,Jim
"[Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.",Dwight
What?,Jim
My headphones are broken.,Dwight
Right.,Jim
Can I listen to my music at a low volume?,Dwight
Yeah that's great. Great.,Jim
"Okay? [Unplugs cord, sings] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-'",Dwight
[Overlapping] When's the last time you upgraded your printer?,Jim
- and the man in the moon. When you coming home Dad? I don't know when-',D
[Whispers] Please stop that!,Jim
-But we'll be together then-',Dwight
Can you grow up?,Jim
"-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then.'",Dwight
[Turns off Dwight's music] Whether it's this time or next time.,Jim
[Vocalizes and continues song] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon',Andy
[On business call] Yeah.,Jim
"[Singing, Dwight supplies beats] 'Little boy blue and the man in the moon.'",Andy and Dwight
"No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--",Jim
When you coming home Dad?,Andy and Dwight
"You know, can I call you back?",Jim
I don't know when-',Andy and Dwight
"That would be great, thank you.",Jim
"But we'll get together then, we're gonna have a good time-'",Andy and Dwight
"[On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.",Jim
I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.,Jim
This fax came for you. [Coughs],Erin
Oh no no no! Are you feeling ill?,Jo
Uh...,Erin
"Oh no honey, if you got a bug, I want you to go on home. I can't have you getting Callie and Jo Jr. sick. These dogs have got to be in a commercial with Dwight Howard next week.",Jo
Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.,Erin
"Yeah, but you sound like death, girl. Now why don't you go on home and take care of yourself and get in bed. And shred that and have them send me a clean fax, okay?",Jo
Well... [Jo closes door on her],Erin
She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right?,Andy
Yes?,Jo
I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you. [Turns feint],Andy
Oh! You're sick! [Andy coughs] Dangit! That's exactly why I sent that receptionist home.,Jo
"No, no, no, no, no.",Andy
Get everybody sick in the office.,Jo
I have some good ideas...,Andy
We don't need any heroes here honey. It's time for you to get on home now.,Jo
You sure?,Andy
You'll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on.,Jo
Very nice.,Michael
"Not bad, huh?",Daryl
"A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?",Michael
I impressed her with my good ideas.,Daryl
"Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?",Michael
I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there.,Daryl
"How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?",Michael
"Now Mike, I have to ask you to leave, so that I can learn about this tiny television.",Daryl
Okay. All right.,Michael
Hey there.,Jo
Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.,Michael
Well there's chatting time and there's working time. I'm still on working time.,Jo
"Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.",Michael
"Well, if you feel like you've done a solid days work...",Jo
Right. What?,Michael
"Well I mean, if you can put your name on this day, and be proud of the amount of work you've done, then, by all means, you should toodle on home.",Jo
Mm. mm. Oh well.,Michael
Anything else I can help you with?,Jo
"No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish. [Exits, closes door, takes off coat.] Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.",Michael
"Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.",Kevin
Hey Pack-man.,Michael
"Hey what's up, Butt-plug?",Todd Packer
How you doing stud? You already there?,Michael
"Dude, I've been here since three! I've boot and rallied twice.",Todd Packer
How's the lady situation?,Michael
Fat and ugly. You might actually have a chance.,Todd Packer
"Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.",Michael
"Oh here's what you do. Hike up your skirt and pull out your tampon, borrow some balls and come meet me!",Todd Packer
Yeah. Maybe next year.,Michael
"Maybe next 'queer.' Hey ladies, who wants some bangers and mash?",Todd Packer
"[Opens door, surprised] Oh! Andy!",Erin
Hi!,Andy
I'm in my jammy-jams!,Erin
"That's okay, I'm in my 'worky-works.' You look amazing!",Andy
"Oh, thanks. Come in!",Erin
Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?,Meredith
Oh I'm in.,Kevin
I'm in.,Oscar
"All right. [The four of them get out of chairs to run out, Jo exits her office. They retreat.]",Meredith
"Oh, you don't become the most powerful woman in Tallahassee by slacking off. [Scoffs] You do it by working hard. Or marrying rich. I did both!",Jo
"Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles 'Cat's in the Cradle' song]",Dwight
"Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening [phone rings] I have...",Dwight
Hello?,Jo
"Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.",Jim
"Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers.",Jo
"You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!",Jim
Okay.,Jo
Okay.,Jim
Sorry Sugar. What'd you want?,Jo
"Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.",Dwight
Thank you.,Jo
[pops back into Jo's doorway] Thanks again by the way.,Jim
Hey! What are you fellas doing up here?,Daryl
We're here to bust you out!,Warehouse guy 1
"I wish, but uh-",Daryl
Dude! Your shirt tucked in?,Warehouse guy 1
"Oh. Yeah, um, I must have did that when I was in the bathroom. All right then, uh, let me get to it.",Daryl
All right.,Warehouse guy 1
See you later.,Warehouse guy 2
Your hand's cold.,Erin
It is? I'm sorry.,Andy
"Yeah, have some more blanket.",Erin
"Okay, thanks.",Andy
What's up?,Reid
Whoa!,Andy
"You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.",Erin
I didn't know you had a brother.,Andy
He's my foster brother.,Erin
"Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard. [They shake hands]",Andy
Cold hands. [Takes spot next to Erin on love seat],Reid
"Are we rotating seats, or?",Andy
"Oh yeah, you're the guest. Take the easy chair, best seat in the house. Plus, you don't have to sit next to this big dork and her smelly feet.",Reid
"Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them! [puts her feet in his face]",Erin
Ooh! [Erin giggles],Reid
"So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?",Andy
None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.,Erin
All right. Formative years. [She laughs],Andy
Nice skirt.,Reid
"Yeah, it's a kilt.",Andy
"Oh! Sorry! Sorry, sorry. [They retreat. Pan around office still full with staff.]",Night cleaning crew
"Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.",Angela
Overnight all my damn bags home. I'm carrying nothing but my Sable gloves. I've had it with Homeland Security. And I want you to put all those tracking numbers in my Blackberry.,Jo
How late do we have to work tonight?,Michael
You never know with Jo. Sometimes we're here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days.,Gabe
Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?,Michael
"Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right? I will date when I'm dead! [Laughs]",Gabe
"Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing.",Michael
Hello Jo.,Michael
Anything I can do for you Puddin'?,Jo
"There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8:30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees.",Michael
Hmm.,Jo
"I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.",Michael
All right then.,Jo
"Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day. [Starts to leave office] And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.",Michael
Michael?,Jo
Yes.,Michael
I look forward to that too.,Jo
Ooh. It's coming down out there.,Andy
"Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.",Erin
"No, I-",Andy
I'm so sorry I was so sick. [Andy leans in. She leans in. Reid appears in background. Erin kisses Andy on the cheek.],Erin
"Ah. Oh great, now I'm gonna get sick. [They both laugh]",Andy
"Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!",Michael
[cheering Michael],"Meredith, Creed, Oscar and Matt"
Drinks are on me!,Michael
"No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!",Oscar
Oh -hoh! All right.,Michael
"Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late? Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something: Do I even like her? As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, 'Don't worry, be happy.'",Michael
Whoops! [Humps Michael],Todd Packer
"Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. [Meredith joins behind Packer] What the hell is going on back there?",Michael
Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.,Jim
What the hell is this?,Dwight
Oh!,Jim
This is not Mega-Desk.,Dwight
"No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk.",Jim
"That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.",Dwight
Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk],Jim
"Hello, Dwight Schrute?",Dwight
"Hey Jim, Jim. Come here. [holds up photo] Do you know who that is?",Michael
No.,Jim
"Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans...",Michael
Is he you?,Jim
[laughs] I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.,Michael
Where did you take that?,Jim
In my condo complex.,Michael
"Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.",Jim
"I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.",Michael
Sure. That they should do one.,Jim
"[feigning accent] Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?",Michael
Who's that?,Jim
"Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.",Michael
John Dillinger.,Jim
No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.,Michael
Captain Crunch.,Jim
"Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?",Michael
At the Yankees game. Yeah.,Jim
"Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.",Michael
"I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...",Jim
"I know, I know.",Michael
...in your condo complex.,Jim
I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.,Michael
M. Night Shulman?,Jim
"[speaking at a staff meeting] First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -",Michael
When are we getting to sales topics?,Stanley
"Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?",Dwight
"Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be.. [muttering, people rise to leave] No, no, meeting's not over.",Michael
But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?,Phyllis
No sales topic per se.,Michael
Well then no Andy Bernard per se. [Andy and others begin exiting the room],Andy
Dwight?,Michael
"Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.",Dwight
"I would like your undivided attention, please.",Michael
You couldn't handle my undivided attention.,Dwight
"Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it's kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.",Michael
"Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier.",Dwight
Yeah.,Michael
When I was asking about the leads.,Dwight
M-hmm.,Michael
... is there any news on the leads?,Dwight
Is that all you have to say to me?,Michael
"Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! [leaves office] Alright, Dwight out!",Dwight
"Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?",Dwight
Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.,Angela
"Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.",Phyllis
"Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque. [Jim stands in corner, texting]",Michael
"Oh, sorry, wait one second.",Jim
Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you.,Michael
"This is actually a big potential sale, so...",Jim
You writing your memoirs over there?,Michael
You writing your name over there?,Jim
"Well, it's a pretty big check.",Michael
"That's good. You know, with the kid.",Jim
Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.,Michael
"Alright, here we go. [taps page] Michael...",Jim
"I'm just saying, that -",Michael
Michael - [Michael signs] Great.,Jim
"[on phone] Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick. [motions to Darryl] Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy... [covers phone] I'm making a sale. Sales.",Andy
There's other pencil's in this office.,Darryl
"Give me that [wrestles with Darryl, Andy falls over chair and to the floor]",Andy
Honey and jelly sandwich time. [removes lunch from fridge],Michael
Michael.,Darryl
"Oh, you got to be kidding me. [holds up squashed sandwich] Look at that. That's -",Michael
I know who did that.,Darryl
You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?,Michael
Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.,Darryl
The sales department smashed my sandwich.,Michael
"Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.",Darryl
You don't get it.,Michael
You need to get back on top.,Darryl
That's what she said.,Michael
Yeah.,Darryl
Yeah.,Michael
"Something came for you, Michael. [hands him a parcel]",Erin
Thank you very much.,Michael
What'd you get?,Jim
"Ah, just the stupid leads.",Michael
Alright!,Jim
About time.,Stanley
Me likey!,Andy
"Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.",Phyllis
"Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you. [Angela, Kevin and Oscar applaud]",Michael
"We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael!",Stanley
"[on phone] Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.",Gabe
"Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.",Michael
"Michael, I don't want to incentivise murder. But - we've tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff -",Gabe
They act like I have no power.,Michael
But you do. You are in charge -,Gabe
Thank you.,Miichael
"- of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael.",Gabe
"Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.",Michael
"Okay, good.",Gabe
Exactly that.,Michael
Good.,Gabe
Exactly that.,Michael
Why do you keep repeating - [Michael hangs up],Gabe
"Hello. May I have everyone's attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I'm going to give the leads to... King Creed! [hands him a lead]",Michael
What are you -,Phyllis
- and to King Meredith! [hands her a lead],Michael
They aren't salespeople!,Stanley
And to King Angela! [hands her a lead] Because today we are all kings. And queens [pats Oscar's shoulder].,Michael
What the hell do you think you're doing?,Phyllis
"I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis.",Michael
Hey.,Jim
Hey.,Michael
"So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?",Jim
Mm-hmm.,Michael
"Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?",Jim
Okay. [passes Jim some index cards],Michael
"Hey, alright.",Jim
Alright.,Michael
"Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?",Jim
"Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?",Michael
I don't think you understand -,Jim
I do understand it.,Michael
[holds up card] This one's a map.,Jim
Or is it?,Michael
"Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.",Angela
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?,Phyllis
I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work [hands her a mountain of paperwork],Angela
What are these for?,Phyllis
"It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them.",Angela
I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring -,Kelly
It's my -,Ryan
The Kardashians is a good show.,Stanley
No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?,Ryan
It's about a family. A real-life family.,Kelly
"No, Stanley, do you -",Ryan
"[over phone] Hey baby, what's up?",Pam
I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?,Jim
Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.,Pam
"Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.",Jim
Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair.,Jim
"How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'",Jim
"He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.",Pam
I love you.,Jim
"Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment. [cuts to Jim fishing one of the leads out of a catering size tin of Ravioli] A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally [clue next to Jim reads: 'Now that's Italian!'] Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing [cut to scenes of chaos as everyone argues] Some people shouldn't be in this business.",Michael
Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman.,Andy
Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. [grins] I hid the leads.,Erin
Where?,Andy
"[mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key, Andy begins to walk away] Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. [Andy hovers his hands above her chest] Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.",Erin
Are you...,Andy
Lower.,Erin
Are you sure?,Andy
"Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering]",Erin
"What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car]",Dwight
Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.,Jim
Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.',Dwight
[taps car] Lincoln.,Jim
The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.,Dwight
[holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too.,Jim
The leads are in?,Dwight
"Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.",Dwight
"Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.",Michael
"Kevin! Damnit [runs over to Kevin's desk] Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -",Dwight
You are never going to find them.,Kevin
Really.,Dwight
I'm going to enjoy this.,Kevin
[begins to strangle him] Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?,Dwight
[muffled] I'm still enjoying it.,Kevin
Where are they?,Dwight
Turn the trash. Turn the trash.,Kevin
"Turn the trash [releases him - Kevin coughs] It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.",Dwight
[stands up and reaches for her buttons] Okey-dokey.,Meredith
"No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen.",Kevin
It's coming off anyway.,Meredith
"[dashes to kitchen, overturns the trash can, tastes the bin liner] Clean sack.",Dwight
What -,Kevin
I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.,Erin
"If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.",Toby
"[dives into dumpster, rattling noises then he emerges] It's empty!",Dwight
Wait. What day is today?,Michael
"Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday.",Kevin
"Oh my god. Oh my god [takes off running] oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey [chases after garbage van] wait, wait!",Michael
"Okay. You know what, let's just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car -",Michael
"Michael, why would we all go to the dump?",Phyllis
"Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump.'",Michael
"Not your staff, Michael. You.",Stanley
"Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -",Michael
"Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?",Toby
Really?,Michael
"I'm not going. You did this, not us.",Angela
"Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit [looks to Jim for vocab-reassurance] Complicit. You were all successories!",Michael
"That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.",Darryl
You can.,Michael
I can't. You know that.,Darryl
"Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself.",Michael
"I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.",Dwight
[looks around dump] This place has gone to hell.,Dwight
"You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.",Michael
"Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.",Dwight
"Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters.",Michael
"[to Oscar] You're adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't -",Kelly
Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.,Jim
Why?,Kelly
Just all the - drama.,Jim
What drama?,Kelly
"Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?",Jim
So unnecessary.,Kelly
"Oh, good, phew, thank god you said that.",Jim
"I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that?",Kelly
I have new baby pictures.,Jim
Don't use your cute baby to make us like you.,Kelly
"She's wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]",Jim
"If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly.",Stanley
Didn't we kind of start it?,Jim
I think you're remembering that wrong?,Phyllis
Yeah.,Andy
"I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.",Phyllis
"Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?",Jim
"All those who agree, say aye [all present - Stanley, Andy and Phyllis - raise their hands] All those opposed -",Andy
I don't think we need opposed.,Jim
"[kicking through rubbish at the dump] You've changed, man.",Michael
"Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?",Dwight
"Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.",Michael
Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.,Dwight
"No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight.",Michael
"When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -",Dwight
Assistant to the managed him -,Michael
"Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!",Dwight
Yeah.,Michael
"Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.",Dwight
You think you would have done better without me? Really?,Michael
I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.,Dwight
Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -,Michael
Kung-fu movies!,Dwight
"You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -",Michael
Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.,Dwight
"That's my wife you're talking about, man.",Michael
"Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? [Michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at Dwight, who sidesteps] You watch it!",Dwight
"If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.",Michael
Don't do it [lobs something at Michael],Dwight
"No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. [they throw volleys of rubbish at each other] No, time out, time out. [Michael inspects a box, then hurls it at Dwight] Time in!",Michael
No! [lunges for a large wooden spool],Dwight
"Don't even think about that [Dwight begins rolling it towards Michael, as he reaches him Dwight kicks it and falls backward. The spool comes to a halt in front of Michael, and Michael pushes it towards Dwight.]",Michael
"[kicks spool] Stop it, get out! That's my spool.",Dwight
What's the least we can do to make this okay?,Phyllis
I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.,Jim
And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too.,Andy
I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.,Phyllis
That is a dangerous precedent.,Stanley
Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.,Jim
"Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.",Phyllis
"Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.",Jim
"Okay, fine. Cash it is.",Phyllis
Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches'.,Andy
"Okay, Dwight. Here we go [picks up a sink, spills dump juice on his pants] oh god.",Michael
Oh [half-heartedly throws something],Dwight
"We're never going to find those leads, are we? [they both sit on the edge of a claw-footed bathtub]",Michael
"[surveys the mountains of trash surrounding them] Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.",Dwight
"So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -",Phyllis
"No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay [others enter] Hey everybody!",Jim
[stares at the table filled with treats] Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.,Meredith
"No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry.",Jim
Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.,Andy
"Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So... [Jim gestures for her to continue]",Phyllis
"Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.",Oscar
"Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.",Kevin
Do you have any pastries without fruit?,Angela
Yes! We do. [opens box] Eclairs.,Jim
"[enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our -",Stanley
- two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.,Jim
"Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.",Phyllis
[beams] This is - nice! [pats Oscar's shoulder] All of us back together.,Stanley
This [picks up racquet] Why would somebody throw that out?,Michael
"Hey [holds up an old sweater] You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?",Dwight
"Yeah, she does - she loves purple. [Dwight sniffs it] Does it stink?",Michael
Yeah [puts it back in the bath tub],Dwight
"Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would read:",Michael
Hope - grows.,Dwight
In the dump.,Michael
"[drives into office parking lot, honking horn. Enormous purple object strapped to the roof of their car] Woo hoo!",Dwight
Good news that you found our leads?,Stanley
No! Better!,Michael
We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room. [reaches out the window and pats it],Dwight
Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.,Phyllis
"Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only [they both cheer and high-five]",Dwight
[at dump] It's freezing out here.,Andy
[strips off jacket] Go on. I have warm blood. [tries to drape her small jacket across Andy's back],Erin
"Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met. [Andy and Erin kiss]",Andy
[Michael grunts and strains while doing push-ups] Breathe. Work your core. Come on.,Dwight
How many is that?,Michael
"Not counting the last one, 25.",Dwight
Count the last one.,Michael
"Ok, 25 and one girl push-up!",Dwight
"Oh, new record!",Michael
Okay.,Dwight
"Oh, what did you do today?",Michael
I made a sale.,Jim
"Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.",Michael
What do we get if we do 'em?,Meredith
"My respect. [everyone returns to work] Okay, I'll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups -",Michael
And one girl push-up.,Dwight
"Gets to go home. [everyone starts to do push-ups] Ooh! I say 'dance,' they say 'how high?' Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. [steps on Angela] Disqualified!",Michael
Ow!,Angela
"What do we got? Creed, disqualified.",Michael
"[from desk chair] Oh, come on!",Creed
19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.,Jim
"[Stanley straining and breathing heavily] Oh, wow, that is adorable!",Michael
Ten...,Phyllis
"Yeah, I'm betting one more.",Michael
"Eleven, wow!",Phyllis
Good.,Michael
[chanting] Stan-ley! Stan-ley! Stan-ley...,Everyone
"Alright, alright. [chanting continues]",Michael
"Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.",Oscar
"Well, it's not exactly fair. He's got all of his weight that's helping him go down.",Michael
"25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!",Dwight
"One more, one more! [cheers and applause]",Phyllis
"You okay? You okay, Stanley?",Oscar
Excuse me.,Stanley
Wow. [applause],Jim
"Hey. Matt, right?",Oscar
"Hey, Oscar. You're here early.",Matt
I always come in at 7.,Oscar
"No, you don't.",Warehouse Guy
"Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?",Oscar
"I don't know. I'm free. If you hear of anything going on, let me know.",Matt
Yeah.,Oscar
"Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.",Oscar
"Hey, what's up?",Darryl
"Hey, nice office.",Oscar
"Thanks, it's cool. So...",Darryl
"You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.",Oscar
Has that ever happened? Ever?,Darryl
Didn't we? I think we did.,Oscar
You want me to invite Matt?,Darryl
"Yeah, the whole gang, Matt included.",Oscar
"Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.",Darryl
So happy hour.,Oscar
Happy hour. My pleasure.,Darryl
All right.,Oscar
So what do you think?,Oscar
"Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.",Phyllis
"Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?",Phyllis
A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.,Andy
"I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.",Jim
"Oh, baloney.",Andy
Good one.,Jim
Ring her up.,Andy
"Absolutely, I will do that right now.",Jim
"I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.",Jim
"So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-",Jim
[on phone] Yes! Yes! I would love to!,Pam
Ha! Knew it!,Andy
"[through phone] It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God!",Pam
I did not see this coming.,Jim
"Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto. [whispering] Are you going later?",Andy
"Sure, if you are.",Erin
Yes.,Andy
"Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.",Erin
Whoa.,Andy
"We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um... but we're kinda keeping it quiet for now 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, and we just don't want all the drama.",Andy
Exactly.,Erin
"Yeah, cause when everyone knows- [knock on window, open blinds to Kevin giggling and making sexual gestures] That's actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.",Andy
Quiet.,Erin
"Hey, boss man.",Andy
Yes?,Michael
"A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?",Andy
"Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time.",Michael
"I'm sorry, I meant later.",Andy
"Ok, yes. Sure.",Michael
For happy hour?,Andy
"No, I got that.",Michael
Trying to get a head count.,Andy
I am in.,Michael
"All right, yes! It's a deal.",Andy
It's a deal.,Michael
"Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie.",Pam
Okay.,Jim
I want her to meet Michael.,Pam
Why?,Jim
"They're both single, I have a sense they might-",Pam
You've been gone for a long time.,Jim
It is not that. Kevin! Oh!,Pam
Yeah! [hugs Pam],Kevin
"Hey, how are you?",Pam
"Oh, I missed you so much.",Kevin
Aw!,Pam
Yeah!,Kevin
Yeah!,Pam
Waaah! [starts to make crying baby noises],Kevin
"When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.",Kevin
"Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God! [laughs]",Michael
Easy.,Jim
"It's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party...",Michael
"Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.",Jim
Sucks to be you.,Michael
Would you like to be our fourth?,Jim
That would be sublime.,Michael
All right.,Jim
"So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.",Darryl
"Hey, Michael.",Pam
Yes.,Michael
This is my friend Julie.,Pam
"Hello, how are you?",Michael
Good. Hi.,Julie
What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for? [Julie laughs],Michael
Julie laughs at everything.,Pam
So you work with Pam and Jim?,Julie
"Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.",Michael
[giggles] I should hope not.,Julie
"No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.",Michael
Hey.,Isabel
"Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.",Pam
Of course.,Isabel
You want to play pool?,Pam
"Um, I'm gonna do a lap. See if I know anyone.",Isabel
Ok.,Pam
"And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-",Angela
"Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel.",Dwight
Mm-hmm.,Isabel
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?,Dwight
A girl like me is why a guy like you comes to a place like this.,Isabel
"Ooh, I love repartee.",Dwight
Do you?,Isabel
Usually means there's a battle scene coming.,Dwight
"So, what do you do?",Michael
I am an ESL teacher.,Julie
Really?,Michael
Yeah.,Julie
"See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?",Michael
Are you thinking that I said 'ESP?',Julie
Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.,Michael
"I was a little nervous when Pam told me he was her boss, but he doesn't act like a boss at all. If I had a boss like that, we'd never get anything done.",Julie
So what do you think?,Jim
About what?,Michael
About Julie?,Jim
She's nice.,Michael
Yeah.,Jim
Yeah.,Michael
So you like her?,Jim
"Uh, yeah, sure.",Michael
So Pam was right?,Jim
About what?,Michael
About you two hitting it off.,Jim
"[removing tie] Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything. [puts on backwards golf cap]",Michael
"My brother, good head, bad heart. Good head, bad heart.",Hide
I know.,Oscar
"Hey, Michael, where have you been? [Michael shoots pool ball up into their faces]",Pam
"Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?",Jim
Why are you wearing a hat now?,Pam
"Guys, come on, I'm on a date. Let me do my thang.",Michael
"Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning? [tries to wink]",Michael
You want to just make a run for it?,Jim
Maybe.,Pam
Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam's chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!,Kevin
What is happening?,Jim
Whoa! What is crackin?,Andy
"Guys, one second. [on dance videogame]",Ryan
"We're focusing, we're focusing, we can't talk.",Kelly
What's this game?,Erin
One second.,Ryan
"Yeah, how do you play?",Andy
"Guys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it's all yours now.",Ryan
Only three tickets.,Kelly
"If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.",Ryan
Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.,Kelly
"I know, but you wanted the big thing.",Ryan
"Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?",Andy
Oh I know.,Erin
"They'd be like, 'what's up with those two?'",Andy
"Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.'",Erin
"Did we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch.",Andy
"Yes, okay. Yeah, that's smart.",Erin
No drama. Ok.,Andy
"Oh, air hockey, basketball, we could play that. Oh, whack-a-mole.",Isabel
Any brothers or sisters?,Dwight
Three brothers.,Isabel
Really?,Dwight
"Two are in the Marines, one's a cop.",Isabel
Vegetarian?,Dwight
No. I love meat.,Isabel
What's your blood type?,Dwight
O-negative. Universal donor.,Isabel
"Universal donor. [startled by Angela, curses]",Dwight
"Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.",Dwight
"Hey, guys, guys, guys. [steals a cherry from waitress passing buy] Watch this. Ready?",Michael
What are you doing?,Julie
I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.,Michael
"Michael, you don't have to do this.",Jim
"[choking] Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.",Michael
"I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.",Michael
"Hey, you two having fun?",Phyllis
Did you tell them?,Andy
No.,Erin
"This is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama!",Andy
I get it.,Erin
[Isabel and Dwight playing whack-a-mole] You are amazing at this. How did you get so good?,Isabel
Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.,Dwight
Whack!,Isabel
Extend the fingers more.,Dwight
Whack!,Isabel
Good.,Dwight
This looks like a hoot.,Angela
"Hey, monkey, how you doing?",Dwight
Whack.,Angela
"Listen, can I talk to you for a second?",Dwight
Okay.,Angela
"Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.",Dwight
It's no worry.,Angela
"It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.",Dwight
I could see enjoying that.,Angela
"No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.",Dwight
But we signed the contract.,Angela
"Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.",Dwight
We both-you didn't dup-,Angela
[Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.,Jim
Maybe it should come from a man.,Pam
Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.,Jim
Hello.,Bar Manager
Hello.,Michael
Hi.,Bar Manager
Hi.,Michael
You wanna pay 400 bucks to re-felt this table?,Bar Manager
"Yeah, why don't you send the bill to 23 I Don't Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania?",Michael
"Hey, Michael, why don't you just get down.",Pam
"Hey, she can tell I'm on a date, right? Right? I'm just having fun.",Michael
"Ted, are we having fun?",Bar Manager
Really? You told on me. That's lame.,Michael
We got a problem?,Bouncer
Yes. Homelessness. What?,Michael
"All right, go.",Bar Manager
Where?,Michael
Get out. Now.,Bar Manager
"Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry.",Michael
"Ok, um, why don't we just finish the game? Michael, it's your shot.",Pam
She can't talk to us that way.,Michael
"You guys are stripes, I think...",Pam
"You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?",Michael
It stopped.,Jim
"Well, I am starting it again!",Michael
Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.,Pam
"Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and I'm gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize.",Michael
Then I am sorry that I didn't kick you out.,Bar Manager
I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.,Michael
"Well, uh, I'm the manager here, sir.",Bar Manager
"Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I don't see that from you.",Michael
Is that how you do it?,Bar Manager
Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.,Michael
Really? How much have you written?,Bar Manager
I've written all of it... in my head.,Michael
Oh.,Bar Manager
"If you're really interested, it's called 'Somehow I Manage' and there's going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up.",Michael
Huh. Have you read Lee Iacocca's? It's a classic.,Bar Manager
"Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it.",Michael
"Dude, tonight! You're not going to want to put it down. It's gonna make you want to go out and buy a Chrysler tomorrow.",Bar Manager
I own a Chrysler.,Michael
Shut up.,Bar Manager
"No, you shut up.",Michael
What's your drink?,Bar Manager
Grenadine.,Michael
What?,Bar Manager
"We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead.",Andy
Okay.,Erin
[Andy sits at table with another woman] Hi.,Andy
Hi.,Girl at table
"I don't normally do this, but...",Andy
Do what?,Girl at table
Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people.,Andy
"[Erin sits with man, rubs her hand on his thigh] Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?",Erin
[Andy spits out his drink] What are you doing?,Andy
What we said to do.,Erin
"We didn't say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers!",Andy
I was flirting with a man.,Erin
Get in here. [Andy and Erin go into photo booth] Where did you learn to talk like that?,Andy
The movies. I don't know.,Erin
"Well, what movie? Black Snake Moan?",Andy
I manage a paper company-Dunder Mifflin/Sabre.,Michael
You have a card?,Bar Manager
I did. I actually put it in your bowl.,Michael
Stanley Hudson?,Bar Manager
"No, no.",Michael
"Whoa, a lot of Stanley Hudson's in here.",Bar Manager
"No, it's Michael Scott.",Michael
Michael Scott?,Bar Manager
He is I.,Michael
You just won yourself a lunch.,Bar Manager
"Oh, hey guys. [thumbs up]",Michael
I think I'm gonna go.,Julie
Really?,Pam
Yeah.,Julie
"I'm sorry, he's not usually like that.",Pam
What's he usually like?,Julie
"He's more, just... like... you can go.",Pam
Yeah.,Julie
All right.,Jim
Okay. Bye.,Pam
See ya. Nice girl.,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
"Hey, Julie! You having fun? [Julie leaves]",Michael
"So... when are you coming in for that free lunch? You're gonna want to come in on a day that I'm working. Uh, maybe I can hear more about that book, too.",Bar Manager
"Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right?",Darryl
I couldn't understand a word he said.,Oscar
"Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.",Darryl
Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.,Oscar
"Hey, what's up?",Matt
"There he is! Hey, hey, hey.",Oscar
Anyone up for some hoops?,Matt
Sure. Hoops!,Oscar
Let's do it.,Matt
"Hoop it up, right.",Oscar
This is not what I want my relationship to look like. [holding photo strip of he and Erin fighting],Andy
"[over PA] Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I've been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you.",Andy
"You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go.",Andy
[laughs] You love drama.,Erin
"I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen.",Andy
"With this move, he can't get you.",Dwight
"Well, I think that he could counter that move. The Scranton strangler is a professional strangler.",Isabel
"Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me. I would be like-aaah!",Dwight
Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute.,Angela
Sh-what?,Dwight
You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.,Angela
"No, no, no. [trying to talk over her] Blah blah blah blah!",Dwight
For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.,Angela
What are you talking about?,Isabel
What are you-,Dwight
"Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.",Angela
Angela...,Dwight
Did he not tell you that?,Angela
You're really putting me in an awkward position here.,Dwight
Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?,Angela
"Angela, not here!",Dwight
Dwight?,Angela
Whack! [Isabel smacks Angela on forehead],Isabel
You'll see me in small claims court!,Angela
You are an impressive specimen.,Dwight
Thank you. [Dwight and Isabel kiss],Isabel
"[crying] Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill.",Kelly
"Oh-oh, gosh. Oh.",Pam
You all right?,Jim
"Okay, we have to get home.",Pam
Yeah!,Kevin
"Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady.",Michael
"Actually, you didn't.",Jim
Not at all.,Pam
"I think I did. But I can't take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me.",Michael
"Tell 'em your story, Hide.",Darryl
"In Japan, heart surgeon. Number one. Steady hand. One day, yakuza boss need new heart. I do operation. But, mistake! Yakuza boss die. Yakuza very mad. I hide in fishing boat, come to America. No English, no food, no money. Darryl give me job. Now I have house, American car, and new woman. Darryl save life. My big secret: I kill yakuza boss on purpose. I good surgeon. The best!",Hide
"[Kevin's voice] Oscar, Toby said he left my Girl Scout cookies on my chair. Have you seen them? Wait I'm sitting on them. [all laugh]",Cookie Monster
This is awesome!,Andy
Thank you. It didn't even take that long.,Oscar
"[Kevin's voice] What's the difference between a chimichanga, [Kevin arrives behind the group] a chalupa, and a tostada? Call me back ASAP. It's urgent.",Cookie Monster
This isn't funny. I don't talk like that. [all continue laughing],Kevin
Say 'Me eat cookie.',Phyllis
No. I won't say it.,Kevin
"Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.",Dwight
It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.,Ryan
[gets up and starts to walk to Oscar's desk] Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?,Dwight
Mm-hmm.,Phyllis
I love that show.,Dwight
[Kevin's voice] This is Kevin. This is Kevin.,Cookie Monster
"Good work, buddy.",Ryan
Thank you.,Oscar
"That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please.",Dwight
Yes.,Oscar
"Me, too Oscar.",Kelly
C.C. me,Ryan
"Angela, this is inappropriate.",Kevin
This is my favorite day.,Angela
"It's Secretary's Day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. [Andy unfurling a giant 'Happy Secretary's Day' banner by reception, placing a teddy bear on Erin's chair]. Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's Secretary's Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago. And a Stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin.",Andy
Here you go.,Meredith
"Oh, thank you.",Erin
I do.,Andy
[hands Erin a basket of beets],Dwight
Thank you.,Erin
"If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom.",Andy
[as Halperts arrive] Welcome back!,Erin
"Hey, thanks.",Pam
"It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off.",Pam
"[at her desk, grabs her plant and sees it dried up, looks at Jim] Oh. You couldn't have watered it?",Pam
I literally did not know that existed until this moment.,Jim
"Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.",Dwight
"It's nice to see you again, Dwight.",Pam
"Hello, Pam.",Dwight.
[arrives at Michael's office and sits] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day.,Andy
I'm going to give Erin $15.,Michael
I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.,Erin
A one-on-one lunch with Erin?,Michael
"Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. [Michael glances over at Erin in reception, Erin waves her teddy bear's arm at Michael].",Andy
She's kind of a rube.,Michael
[slams his hand on Michael's desk] That's my girlfriend you're talking about.,Andy
Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch.,Michael
[taping desk] She's gonna be so psyched.,Andy
"[walks over to Erin's desk] Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary's Day.",Michael
"Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.",Erin
I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to...[Erin snaps a picture of Michael] lunch.,Michael
I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.,Erin
Ugh.,Michael
Just the two of us.,Erin
"Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm...",Michael
"Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...",Erin
"Okay, well, we'll figure something. [Michael turns and starts back toward his office]",Michael
Oh.,Erin
"[looks at Andy who is urging he agree with her, Michael turns around] Okay, let's go to Hayworth's.",Michael
[cheerfully] Okay.,Erin
All right.,Michael
"[sitting at kitchen table with Darryl] Have a cookie, Kev.",Meredith
"Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that.",Kevin
I brought those in. It's my birthday. That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.,Darryl
"Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. [pats Darryl's back] Happy Birthday.",Kevin
Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it],Darryl
"[as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.",Darryl
"They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me.",Kevin
"[again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level...",Kevin
This is violent and offensive.,Gabe
Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.,Kevin
"It's awful. [reaches for tissue box, hands it to Kevin]",Gabe
I'm not crying.,Kevin
You have some food on your face.,Gabe
[on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth],Kevin
The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure.,Gabe
"Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around.",Gabe
Yeah.,Kevin
"And that's straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao.",Gabe
[in his car with Erin driving to lunch] Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I'm kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.,Michael
I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?,Erin
"[shakes head, annoyed] I don't know.",Michael
I would have chosen the 1490's.,Erin
Ahhh.,Michael
Cause America was discovered.,Erin
Right. [sighs],Michael
"[at lunch] And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. [Michael keeps moving around, very clearly bored and annoyed]. So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?",Erin
An age or month?,Michael
"Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.",Erin
I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.,Michael
How many pillows do you sleep on at night?,Erin
So how are things going with Andy?,Michael
He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.,Erin
"Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo.",Michael
Yeah I love that.,Erin
"Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser.",Michael
What?,Erin
I don't think he is the best dresser. Reminds me of Easter.,Michael
Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?,Erin
Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh.,Michael
Here we go. Hot plate.,Hayworth's waiter
Okay.,Michael
"And your salad, miss.",Hayworth's waiter
Why wouldn't he tell me that?,Erin
I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.,Michael
They had sex?,Erin
"They were engaged, so... [Erin looks shocked] Okay, you know what, sir?",Michael
Yes?,Hayworth's waiter
"Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?",Michael
Of course. I'll get you a bowl of pickles.,Hayworth's waiter
Thank you.,Michael
"Uhhhh, they were engaged?",Erin
Mm-hmm. Yeah.,Michael
"[face looks disgusted, moves around uncomfortably] Uh-oh...",Erin
Well...,Michael
"[moans, pulls hair over her face]",Erin
What are you doing? What are you doing?,Michael
"In the Foster home, my hair was my room. [exhales, prolonged exclaiming]",Erin
"Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now.",Michael
"[breathes heavily, groans]",Erin
[turns to other restaurant patrons] I'll have what she's having!,Michael
[in Michael's car] Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.,Michael
[feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.,Pam
What's up?,Jim
Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.,Dwight
"Dwight, don't be gross.",Jim
"No, no, he's right.",Pam
"Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy.",Dwight
"That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?",Pam
"[removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.",Dwight
"You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?",Pam
Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.,Dwight
"Mm. [walks into bathroom, Meredith is using her brest pump] Meredith!",Pam
I just like the way it feels.,Meredith
What are you doing?!,Pam
Just relax. Okay.,Meredith
Relax?!,Pam
This is like the Cadillac of pumps.,Meredith
Give it back to me now.,Pam
"Okay, I was just warming it up.",Meredith
It's disgusting!,Pam
It's not a big deal.,Meredith
It's not sterile!,Pam
We're both girls. Who cares?,Meredith
So... how was lunch?,Andy
Lunch was fine.,Erin
Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?,Andy
"I don't know. It was lunch, Andy.",Erin
"Well, I know. [stammers] Just want... I mean... [chuckles]",Andy
Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.,Oscar
"God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.",Erin
"[using a Cookie Monster voice] 'My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant.' See I did the voice.",Kelly
That's a little derivative.,Ryan
But parody is always derivative.,Kelly
"Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?",Ryan
Jim does a really good one. Do yours.,Pam
"Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. 'Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.'",Jim
"Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?",Gabe
"Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.'",Jim
Ok.,Gabe
"Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.",Andy
"You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so..",Michael
I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.,Andy
No. No. No.,Michael
Specific shout-out..,Andy
Stop talking.,Michael
"Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote [starts to use a British accent] a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..",Andy
[throws a piece of cake at Andy's face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.,Erin
Oh God.,Michael
Can we talk about this in private?,Andy
I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?,Erin
Yes.,Andy
Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?,Erin
"No, no never.",Pam
Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?,Erin
Yeah pretty much.,Dwight
Who are you?! I don't know you! [pushes someone away to leave],Erin
"I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue.",Gabe
"Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you.",Kevin
Thanks.,Erin
"So if you need anything, I'm right over there.",Kevin
"[imitating Cookie Monster] 'Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.'",Pam
"Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days.",Gabe
"What? What do you mean, suspend me?",Pam
I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.,Jim
"Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight.",Gabe
"Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.",Dwight
I don't want to hear it. Suspended.,Gabe
C' is for suspension.,Kevin
Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?,Andy
"Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.",Michael
"I was going to tell her, just on my own time.",Andy
"You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.",Michael
"Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.",Andy
Psst. Hey. Erin.,Angela
"You want to talk to me, come to my desk.",Erin
You embarrassed me earlier.,Angela
Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.,Erin
You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.,Angela
I want to throw up just thinking about it.,Erin
You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!,Angela
"[standing behind Erin] I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know.",Toby
Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.,Pam
Really?,Erin
Yeah. And he worked here too.,Pam
"It was Andy, wasn't it?",Erin
"No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants.",Pam
I hope you find what you're looking for.,Erin
Thank you. [kisses Jim on the cheek],Pam
[talking on the phone] So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.,Gabe
[answers phone] Hey Toby.,Pam
"I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal.",Toby
Very interesting.,Pam
"Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure...",Toby
[Gabe walks in] Thanks Toby.,Pam
"Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. [Pam hands Jim a note] It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension.",Gabe
I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.,Pam
"And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.",Jim
"[gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.",Dwight
Great.,Gabe
[gets on one knee] I kneel before you.,Dwight
"Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.",Gabe
Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.,Dwight
"[following Jim and Pam to their car] Guys, to err is human. [trying to block their car]",Gabe
Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?,Erin
"Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.",Andy
How long were you guys together?,Erin
A year.,Andy
A year? You were together for a year?,Erin
Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else...,Andy
I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?,Erin
I didn't see that movie.,Andy
[walking back into the office] That was ugly. I'm sorry you had to see that.,Gabe
Do they still get paid?,Kelly
It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened.,Gabe
Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.,Oscar
Pathetic.,Meredith
Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] 'Or cookies.',Gabe
What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?,Dwight
Alright.,Gabe
"[imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.",Kevin
You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang.,Gabe
I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit.',Dwight
Ciao' Right? 'Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee.',Kevin
Why don't we say ciao to the impressions? [everyone says ciao],Gabe
[sitting on bench outside groaning],Erin
Erin?,Michael
Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.,Erin
"No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?",Michael
I can't trust Andy anymore.,Erin
Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.,Michael
It's Andy's fault.,Erin
"Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.",Michael
"Oh, I like his butt.",Erin
You said butt.,Michael
You tricked me!,Erin
"Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him: 'Hey! Hey Scott!'",Michael
"Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day.",Andy
Hey Kevin it's Oscar. I'm looking at the sheet you sent me. And I can't seem to find the column for shipping cost.,Oscar's voice from the computer
I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.,Kevin
I don't get it.,Phyllis
"Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.",Jim
Yeah. 'I vant to count to ten'.,Pam
"But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.",Kevin
But you're an accountant too.,Kelly
Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch?,Oscar
That would have been funny.,Pam
But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.,Kevin
"[walking up] Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? 'Oscar. I am the Count.' Nailed him. Nailed him. [Gives Kevin a fist pump] Good work Cookie Monster.",Michael
Thank you.,Kevin
"Buenos dias, Erin.",Michael
"Buenos dias, Miguel. [phone rings] Hello, Dunder-Mifflin.",Erin
"No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.",Michael
"I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.",Michael
"Buenos dias, Jaime.",Michael
"Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?",Jim
"Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!",Michael
"Guten tag, Herr Michael.",Dwight
"I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.",Dwight
La telefona.,Michael
El telefono.,Oscar
"Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.",Oscar
Your office is full of genitalia.,Oscar
"[clears throat] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!",Michael
That's what he says?',Oscar
"Damn it. [knock on door] Ah, Angelo.",Michael
Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela's forehead with female genitalia] Michael.,Angela
Yo soy Cancun.,Michael
"[removes post-it, leaves] Uhh!",Angela
"All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.",Jim
"You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] 'I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee.'",Pam
"Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.",Jim
Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.,Michael
"You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.",Dwight
I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.,Michael
"If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?",Dwight
[whispers] That's a good point.,Jim
This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.,Pam
Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.,Jim
"We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.",Pam
[whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.,Jim
[vaudeville delivery] Yee.,Pam
"Hi, uh, Donna Newton, here to see Michael Scott.",Donna
"Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim.",Jim
Hi!,Donna
How are you?,Jim
Did somebody order a hooker over here?,Michael
"[laughing] Oh, stop that.",Donna
Hi. How are you?,Michael
"There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so...",Michael
"Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.",Michael
You look exactly alike.,Donna
"Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister.",Pam
I have a sense about these things.,Donna
All right.,Jim
You have some ancestors in common... somewhere back.,Donna
I knew it. You should see their baby.,Angela
"[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.",Jim
[barges in] Hi.,Michael
Hold on one second.,Jim
"Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?",Michael
What?,Jim
Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.,Michael
None of this is time sensitive.,Jim
"Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.",Michael
"Oh, yeah, thank you.",Donna
"Okay, I have more of them.",Michael
"You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities.",Gabe
Sounds all right.,Darryl
What is this?,Dwight
"Oh, this is 'Print in All Colors,' Sabre's minority executive training program.",Gabe
"It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.",Dwight
I didn't say 'a'ight.',Darryl
How do I apply?,Dwight
You have to be a minority.,Gabe
"Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?",Dwight
Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.,Gabe
Come here. Come here.,Dwight
Hmm?,Gabe
"Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?",Dwight
Well...,Gabe
I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?,Darryl
"One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?",Dwight
"[on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.",Kelly
"Oh, man. White people, right?",Dwight
I don't know if she was white.,Kelly
"Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.",Dwight
Yeah.,Kelly
"I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.",Dwight
"Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right.",Kelly
I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.,Dwight
Never thought of myself as an executive before.,Kelly
"I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?",Dwight
"I can't think of any CEO's, any race.",Kelly
You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.,Dwight
I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.,Kelly
That's not... she's... okay. Yes.,Dwight
"I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go! [Michael's picture pops up on the PowerPoint screen] Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.",Michael
Mm-hmm.,Donna
"And that would be a display [image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up] of the crisp, gorgeous black.",Michael
Yeah.,Donna
"It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on.",Michael
This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before.,Michael
Who took the photo?,Donna
Ryan.,Michael
Oh. [Michael quickly advances PowerPoint show to last slide which is 'SEX' in bold white letters on a black background and then exits the show quickly],Donna
And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.,Michael
[giggles] Not bad.,Donna
"Oh, thanks. [softly] You're not bad, either.",Michael
"Thank you. [Michael tries t kiss Donna, Donna clears throat] Hmm.",Donna
Hmm.,Michael
Oh my God. [realizing Jim and Pam are looking through the conference room windows],Donna
Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?,Michael
"[in his office] You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?",Michael
No.,Jim
I'll have one.,Pam
"Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.",Jim
"Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.",Michael
"Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.",Jim
"Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.",Pam
"Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20's it would have been annoying. In my late 20's, I find it really flattering.",Donna
"Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.",Michael
What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?,Pam
What?,Jim
What was that?,Jim
Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.,Pam
"Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.",Jim
Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale.,Pam
"Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.",Jim
"Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]",Pam
How as being a minority affected you?,Dwight
"Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.",Kelly
"Oh, good, and you resent this because...",Dwight
Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.,Kelly
"Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.",Dwight
Just put it in your pocket.,Kelly
[indistinct chatter inside conference room],Michael and Donna
[looking it] Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.,Kevin
You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.,Phyllis
"You ever notice you can ooze two things: sexuality and pus. Man, I tell ya.",Creed
She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.,Phyllis
Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.,Pam
[tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy],Kevin
Is this... is this the best you can do right there?,Donna
"Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.",Jim
"Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business, [removes sweater revealing her revealing top] where, if you're in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like.",Donna
Yeah. [chuckles],Jim
"So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?",Michael
What's that?,Jim
Maybe wee find some wiggle room?,Michael
I don't... I don't think so.,Jim
I think we could. [Donna giggles],Michael
I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...,Oscar
"Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.",Michael
"Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.",Oscar
Why don't you run them again?,Michael
What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?,Jim
"If she is, it's working.",Michael
"Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says 'no,' then she is not interested.",Kevin
She does not like him.,Jim
You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?,Pam
cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.,Jim
I was after your money.,Pam
"Well, the joke was on you.",Jim
"Yes, it was.",Pam
[typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.,Kelly
Okay...,Ryan
Hey... what are you guys doing?,Dwight
"This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic.",Kelly
Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.,Ryan
"Oh, that is so good.",Kelly
"You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.",Dwight
"Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me.",Kelly
Ryan? What does he know?,Dwight
It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?,Ryan
Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.,Kelly
We?',Dwight
"When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager.",Kelly
And then the two of us are cleanin' house.,Ryan
"Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.",Dwight
So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...,Michael
Mm-hmm.,Donna
Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?,Michael
Yes.,Donna
I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?,Michael
"Oh, I haven't tried those. No.",Donna
They're good [Donna grabs mint],Michael
You want one?,Donna
Sure.,Michael
"It's like cool... 'certified cool.' I like how they say 'certified.' Like there's some consortium of... [Michael grabs the mint from Donna's hand with his mouth, Donna pulls her hand away] Michael!",Donna
I can't stop myself from kissing her.,Michael
"Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day.",Kevin
"Well, why don't you just move the M&M's?",Andy
"Well, why don't you shut up!",Kevin
"Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.",Michael
It is totally insane.,Jim
"Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.",Oscar
Okay. What do you think?,Michael
"I think it's over, man.",Kevin
Andy?,Michael
Ehh.,Andy
"Okay, some for, some against.",Michael
Nobody's for.,Jim
Pam?,Michael
Hmm?,Pam
What do you think?,Mihael
"Um... I think it's really, really unlikely.",Pam
Okay.,Jim
Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.,Pam
What?,Jim
"I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.",Pam
I'm going with Pam's group.,Michael
Wait.,Jim
Here we go.,Michael
Michael. Michael.,Jim
Okay.,Michael
Michael.,Jim
"No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck.",Michael
No.,Jim
"What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.",Michael
Kelly is disqualified!,Dwight
What?,Gabe
"You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.",Dwight
"Yeah, but she's not white, though.",Gabe
"Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.",Dwight
"Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone.",Gabe
"I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.",Darryl
Kelly is the only applicant.,Dwight
"Yeah, unless somebody else applies today.",Gabe
Namaste.,Kelly
"Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.",Dwight
Hello.,Kelly
That's very nice. [referring to Kelly's bindi] I never noticed that before.,Gabe
Sometimes my bangs cover it.,Kelly
"Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh... may I ask you what that means?",Gabe
"I do find that offensive, actually.",Kelly
We should have your contract done by Thursday.,Michael
"Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then.",Donna
Okay.,Michael
"And, um... you know I just wanted to say it was really... really nice to do business with you.",Donna
"Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.",Michael
Thank you. Did I... get everything?,Donna
I don't know. I think so.,Michael
"Yeah, I think so.",Donna
"[whispers] Okay. So... Oh, Donna?",Michael
Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't... we don't validate.,Donna
"No, it's just in the lot, so...",Donna
Thank you so much.,Michael
You're welcome. [they hug] You're... welcome.,Donna
Mmm. [Donna giggles],Michael
Bye.,Donna
"[follows her out of office] Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have...",Michael
"I don't have, uh, any other questions. [blind clanking as she leans against door to prevent from Michael kissing her] I'm just gonna... make my way down to...",Donna
All right. All right. Bye.,Michael
Bye-bye!,Donna
And have a good elevator ride.,Michael
Okay.,Donna
"Oh, what's that out there?",Michael
"Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]",Kevin
How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?,Dwight
Holy cow. I'd be so happy.,Erin
"I wasn't talking to you, pale-face.",Dwight
I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.,Erin
What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.,Dwight
"Dwight, I know these programs. 'Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow.'",Stanley
Yes.,Dwight
I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.,Stanley
Mm!,Erin
"Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.",Dwight
"Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.",Oscar
I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen],Dwight
"For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.",Kelly
"Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program 'print in all colors' initiative.",Dwight
Dwight: What are you doing?,Kelly
Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.,Dwight
"God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves]",Kelly
"Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I'll translate.",Dwight
Why? I don't need translator.,Hide
You don't know what you need. Just...,Dwight
"Well, uh... why don't you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide.",Gabe
"In Japan, heart surgeon, number one. Steady hand.",Hide
"Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?",Pam
I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.,Michael
"You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.",Pam
She suckered you too.,Michael
Mm-hmm.,Pam
Was it the cleavage?,Michael
"Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.",Pam
Yep.,Michael
"Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far.",Phyllis
"You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused.",Andy
"Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?",Erin
God. She left this here?,Michael
Yeah.,Erin
Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.,Michael
What?,Jim
No.,All
Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.,Michael
"It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.",Oscar
Michael...,Pam
[hold up barrette] Well...,Michael
She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.,Pam
"Yeah, I know. I know.",Michael
I'm sorry.,Pam
"I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. [waves, returns to his office, clears throat, turns around and runs out of office]",Michael
Michael! [sighs],Pam
"[runs down to parking lot, sighs]",Michael
[still in parking lot sitting in her car] Michael!,Donna
Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.,Michael
"Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. [clapping] All right.",Gabe
They're going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She'll be the first. The program's mostly black. It's almost too black. That didn't sound right.,Gabe
[puts a bindi on Erin's forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.,Kelly
"Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?",Erin
Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.,Kelly
Great.,Erin
"Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]",Dwight
"Thank you, Dwight.",Kelly
Oh.,Dwight
I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.,Kelly
Gosh. He he.,Dwight
Because I never forget anything.,Kelly
"Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?",Dwight
You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.,Michael
"No, y-you were... right.",Donna
Who?,Michael
You were right.,Donna
About what?,Michael
You were right. [Michael leans into Donna's car to kiss her and they kiss passionately] I'm sorry.,Donna
"No, no. No.",Michael
I'm sor...,Donna
No... [they kiss again],Michael
[returns to office] What happened?,Michael
Kelly got into the minority training program.,Erin
"Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! [all look at him] I kissed. We kissed.",Michael
Ooh.,Kevin
"Oh, Michael.",Phyllis
"No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.",Michael
You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!,Michael
Stop it!,Dwight
Stop what?,Jim
"You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!",Dwight
"[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.",Jim
Yup. That's exactly what we did.,Jim
"It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, 'I will when you lose the baby weight.'",Pam
Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!,Dwight
Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?,Michael
It's a pen.,Jim
"Michael, come on.",Dwight
"Get back to work, Dwight. Please.",Michael
Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically],Dwight
"Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!",Michael
"Who enjoys the weekends? [all raise hands] Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did. [all nod] And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend. So just shout it out.",Michael
I have an idea for your weekend.,Stanley
Okay.,Michael
Let me get back to my desk right now.,Stanley
"Okay, you get out of here, big dog. [high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.",Michael
Stanley got to go.,Pam
"Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.",Michael
Walk around apple orchards.,Andy
Oh!,Michael
Super romantic.,Andy
That's fun.,Michael
Eel fishing.,Dwight
All right.,Michael
Curl up with your favorite DVD.,Darryl
You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.,Meredith
"We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's.",Michael
"Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.",Kelly
"Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, 'I wanna go to Mount Pocono,' you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.",Michael
"Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?",Kelly
"You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.",Michael
Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.,Ryan
You guys think Donna's cheating on me?,Michael
"No, Michael, no.",Pam
Are you nuts?,Dwight
You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...,Pam
"... and... we had sex, too.",Michael
That is right. Don't make any more of it.,Pam
How?,Michael
How what?,Pam
How do I not make any more of it?,Michael
You could start by concluding this meeting.,Pam
"All right. [all stand up to leave] And she won't say, 'I love you.'",Michael
"Oh, no.",Dwight
How many dates have you been on?,Andy
Nine dates. I said it on the second date.,Michael
Mm.,Andy
That seems... quick. Even for lesbians.,Oscar
"Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?",Ryan
Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...,Ryan
"Yeah, she does all that.",Michael
"Sorry, dude.",Ryan
"No, no...",Michael
"Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.",Pam
Run what?,Michael
"Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.",Pam
"Why didn't you just say that, Pam?",Michael
"Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.",Pam
"Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world.",Michael
You do?,Jim
"Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.",Michael
But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.,Jim
That's what makes it so wrong.,Michael
"Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.",Michael
"Oh, God, that tickles. What did...",Dwight
[whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.,Michael
I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card],Dwight
This is you. How much do you charge?,Michael
"$100 a day, plus expenses.",Dwight
I'll give you $50. Money's no object.,Michael
I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.,Dwight
Okay.,Michael
"And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]",Dwight
"Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.",Andy
My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.,Stanley
"Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important.",Andy
"There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?",Gabe
"Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.",Andy
That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.,Gabe
What are we gonna do about this?,Andy
"I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah.",Gabe
Let me know what they say.,Andy
[puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.,Darryl
What do you mean?,Andy
You didn't feel like he was hiding something?,Darryl
I don't know.,Andy
Like he was... covering something up? Maybe.,Darryl
"Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said 'Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.' [smiles]",Darryl
[sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.,Dwight
"Oh, hi. You work for Michael.",Donna
I work with Michael.,Dwight
Right.,Donna
Dwight Schrute. [they shake hands],Dwight
"Donna, hi.",Donna
"All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.",Dwight
"That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?",Jim
"It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.",Michael
Oh!...,Pam
"Oh, my God",Jim
"It's comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God.",Michael
"You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.",Jim
"I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.",Michael
Why do we have to see what Dwight says?,Pam
Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.,Michael
"Michael, no...",Jim
"No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.",Pam
It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.,Michael
"Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.",Pam
"God, this is so disgusting.",Michael
Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.,Pam
I know.,Michael
And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.,Pam
"That's not true. [Pam stares him down] You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.",Michael
Helene.,Pam
Helene?,Michael
My mother.,Pam
Oh.,Michael
"My mother, Helene. [Jim shakes his head]",Pam
"Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.",Michael
"You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.",Jim
[sighs] All right. [calls Dwight],Michael
"[at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.",Dwight
Thank you.,Donna
"It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]",Dwight
You okay?,Donna
"Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?",Dwight
"[chuckles] Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.",Donna
Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.,Dwight
[moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?,Dwight
"Nope. I'm good, thanks.",Donna
"Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his 'workout']",Dwight
"Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat?",Old lady
Get out of my way. Huh!,Dwight
"Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?",Dwight
I'm out of here.,Donna
"Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.",Dwight
"You stay away from me, or I'm calling security.",Donna
"Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his 'workout' and cannot chase Donna]",Dwight
You're back. What happened?,Michael
"Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.",Dwight
"No, what happened with Donna?",Michael
"Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]",Dwight
Ugh!,Michael
Put your fingers here.,Dwight
No. No! Are you sure?,Michael
"I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.",Dwight
Who eats eight protein bars?,Michael
People who don't trust egg whites.,Dwight
"Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.",Michael
"Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.",Dwight
"What? No, she didn't say that.",Michael
"You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.",Dwight
I am not paying for that membership.,Michael
"[sitting on the floor behind Erin's desk, sighs] Ohhh... mmm...",Michael
Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.,Erin
"No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?",Michael
"Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.",Erin
That's her?,Michael
Yeah.,Erin
"Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. [Michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as Donna approaches] Okay, I'll talk to you later.",Michael
How could you think I would cheat on you?,Donna
I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.,Michael
That's pathetic.,Donna
"Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.",Michael
"When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak. [Dwight is gulping some sort of power shake]",Donna
"If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.",Michael
I told you I like you.,Donna
"Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs]",Michael
"Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would...",Donna
...poop my pants.,Michael
Have you ever been to Vero Beach?,Donna
"Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?",Michael
We're going.,Donna
We are?,Michael
Yeah.,Donna
What's up? I got your e-mail.,Andy
Close the door.,Darryl
Okay.,Andy
I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. [scatting] Andy don't mess with me. [continues scatting] I'll figure something out.,Darryl
Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.,Darryl
Such as?,Andy
"It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was 'Andy,' 'Problem,' 'Eliminate,' something. I don't know what it meant.",Darryl
What? You don't know what it meant? How about 'Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?',Andy
Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that.,Darryl
[chuckles nervously] Yeah. Hah. Hoo.,Andy
"Oh, hey, I love your earrings.",Kelly
Thank you.,Donna
Did Michael get them for you?,Kelly
"No, I bought them myself.",Donna
Where?,Kelly
Steamtown Mall.,Donna
"Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?",Kelly
"You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there.",Donna
Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?,Kelly
"Uh, Franklin Mills.",Donna
[to Pam] What?,Jim
Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.,Pam
"Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.",Pam
"Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?",Jim
No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.,Pam
"Psst... [Creed walks by Andy and draws his right index finger across his neck, further scaring Andy, Andy looks over at Darryl who is staring him down]",Creed
Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.,Andy
"So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. [draws finger across neck] Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less.",Creed
"So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It's Cece. [laughs] She's never gonna do anything wrong.",Pam
Isn't that something?,Donna
Wow. [Pam knocks on Michaels door and goes in] That's exciting.,Michael
"Hey, Michael.",Pam
Hey.,Michael
"I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.",Pam
Well it can wait. It can wait.,Michael
I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.,Pam
Jim is her husband.,Michael
Oh.,Donna
And...,Pam
"And they are having problems, so sh...",Michael
"No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...",Pam
Good in bed.,Michael
"Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.",Pam
"Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?",Michael
[loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!,Pam
"Okay, weirdo.",Michael
I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out],Pam
Yeah I think it'll be a nice trip. We're gonna get a lot done.,Donna
"[to Michael] You're gonna wanna look at the date on that. Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?",Pam
"I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. [Pam and Donna both laugh] Hey, you okay? [to Michael, walking away disappointedly]",Donna
"Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?",Michael
Absolutely. [both leave Michael's office],Pam
"Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.",Darryl
"I know, it's just, I'm scared...",Glen
Your text said 911.,Andy
"Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]",Darryl
It's bad.,Darryl
What's bad?,Andy
It's real bad.,Darryl
Still no plan.,Darryl
"Oh, God.",Andy
It's getting bigger.,Darryl
"I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.",Andy
I can videotape it.,Darryl
Yeah.,Andy
[to camera] There it is.,Darryl
There what is?,Andy
What?,Darryl
Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?,Michael
I don't know who he is.,Pam
God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?,Michael
What?,Pam
"I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.",Michael
You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.,Pam
I have to hear it from her.,Michael
You have to settle down first.,Pam
I need to have her tell me herself. Right?,Michael
Okay. Okay. Yes.,Pam
I need to have her say...,Michael
"Yeah, but you have to calm...",Pam
"I need to say, 'What the hell is that? What the hell is that?'",Michael
"Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.",Pam
"No, God! No, no, oh, my God!",Michael
"[in baby voice] Hi, Michael, hi, Michael",Pam
[calms down] Okay. Okay. Okay.,Michael
"[to Andy] I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000. [smiles] We've investigated. Every time it's been user error. They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that. [pulls out gift card] That's god for five bucks at Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts. [Andy looks over at Darryl and Darryl motions for Andy to go to him]",Gabe
You know what? We should really do something fun this week.,Michael
"Yeah, we should.",Donna
Wouldn't that be fun?,Michael
Yeah.,Donna
How about Thursday?,Michael
"Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do?",Donna
I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?,Michael
"Oh, Friday doesn't work.",Donna
"Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert.",Michael
Shoot. I'm working.,Donna
"Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.",Michael
"Well, won't you be at the concert?",Donna
"Nope, that's Tuesday.",Michael
"Oh, well, I can make it on Tuesday.",Donna
You're cheating. You're cheating on me.,Michael
How do you know?,Donna
"Pam told me. [looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does Donna; Jim, Dwight, and Pam are visible on conference room window, they all scramble as soon as Donna and Michael look up, Pam throwing herself on the floor]",Michael

[to Pam on floor] Nice effort.,Jim
"[in old Michael Scott Paper Company's 'office'] We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. [Darryl is filming Andy's demonstration]",Andy
You haven't even introduced yourself.,Darryl
"Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much.",Andy
You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.,Darryl
Higher? Okay. [speaking slightly higher] Recently certain events have come to my attention...,Andy
Higher. [motions with hand to go up more],Darryl
Make it higher? Okay.,Andy
Mm-hmm,Darryl
[high-pitched] I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation...,Andy
"One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]",Darryl
[higher] May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger... [printer starts smoking and explodes] ah! [speaking lower] It's working. [in normal voice] It's... I knew it!,Andy
This... [removes camera headset],Darryl
"We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off! [Darryl discharges fire extinguisher onto printer] Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing.",Andy
"I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.",Darryl
Who is he?,Michael
"What, what do you mean?",Donna
The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?,Michael
It's you. I'm married.,Donna
I'm the mistress?,Michael
"[on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.",Dwight
"Excuse me. Yeah, I'd appreciate it if you'd just let me run this.",Gym Instructor
"You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!",Dwight
"Don't listen to him, we're approaching a cooldown down a gentle hill.",Gym instructor
No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.,Dwight
"No, guys, no. We're just cooling down...",Gym instructor
"If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! [points to those around him] You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.",Dwight
This here is a radon test kit. [holding out tiny cylinder disc] Okay I will be putting 'em everywhere. And... please don't throw these out. [starts snapping towards Michael's face] This is a radon test kit. [continues snapping] Please don't throw these out. [Michael gives annoyed look] See them all over the office.,Toby
"Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place. The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. [finds radon kit in between his blinds in his office] But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. [throws it away] The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. [finds another radon kit on top of his cabinet] Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite. [takes radon kit from the top of the blinds of his office window and slams it into the trash can]",Michael
Pfffffttt.,Michael
"Come on, Michael. You're interrupting.",Toby
"You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?",Michael
Please sit down.,Toby
"You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.",Michael
YEAH! [laughter],Everyone
"Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.",Michael
No. No!,Everyone
That's... not okay.,Jim
"Okay, alright.",Michael
"You were being really funny, and then you went too far.",Dwight
I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.,Michael
"No, hmmm... that's still...",Dwight
Mm-mm.,Everyone
"Okay geniuses, how would you do it?",Michael
"Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted.",Creed
All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...,Oscar
Is there a curtain rod in the room?,Ryan
I don't know.,Michael
How about make-believe land has anything you want?,Stanley
"Stanley, please, this is serious!",Jim
Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?,Angela
"Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.",Michael
"Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it: You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. [stands up and points to Phyllis] Phyllis, you're Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.",Dwight
I don't wanna do this.,Toby
"[shouting] Toby, just do it! God!",Michael
"Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left]",Dwight
"Ready, one bullet. And boom! [makes shooting noises and mimics a bullet with his fingers tapping Phyllis' throat, then Toby's, and finally Andy's]",Dwight
"Yeah, that works. That works!",Everyone
Good work. [clapping],Michael
What flavors did you get? [yawns],Pam
It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.,Erin
[reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?,Pam
Do you want me to go back to the store?,Erin
"No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.",Pam
This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.,Erin
"Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.",Pam
"After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.",Erin
"[yawns] Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this.",Pam
"That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though.",Erin
We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.,Erin
"And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.",Pam
He's coming.,Erin
"Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.",Pam
[walks in] Hey everyone.,Toby
"No, out! Get out now! Leave now.",Pam
"Leave, get outta here.",Dwight
Leave!,Pam
Right now!,Dwight
"Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?",Pam
[walks in] Morning everyone.,Michael
"Hey! [applauses] Hey, hey!",Everyone
Hi Michael. [gives him a hug],Erin
Hello!,Michael
"Michael, nice tie or something.",Dwight
"Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think. [everyone laughs]",Michael
That's hilarious.,Kevin
That's awesome. You want some ice cream?,Pam
"Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?",Michael
Boi-oi-oi-ing,Kevin
Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later.,Michael
"I don't follow this exactly. Uh, 'The Descendants of any replicants from this union shall have...'",Lawyer
Joint custody,Dwight and Angela
Are we talking about your grandchildren?,Lawyer
No.,Angela
No.,Dwight
"Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.",Angela
Alleged contract.,Dwight
Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.,Angela
"Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.",Dwight
"So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point 'B', uh... the beet juice cleanse?",Dwight
I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.,Angela
How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.,Dwight
"Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]",Angela
Eughh. [looks disgusted],Dwight
No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.,Andy
Could he still be seeing her?,Pam
I don't think he'd do that.,Phyllis
So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?,Jim
"Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.",Andy
Exactly. It happened in Big.,Jim
"No, I gotta go. Text me later.",Michael
I'm really too tired to do this.,Jim
Me too!,Pam
Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?,Jim
Hey Michael.,Pam
Hey.,Michael
"We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.",Pam
We can order in from Hooters.,Jim
"Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.",Michael
We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.,Pam
Billy Joel Rock Band.,Jim
That... exists?,Michael
Yes.,Pam
"Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.",Michael
"[shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?",Pam
"Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions.",Michael
Oh Michael.,Phyllis
Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?,Michael
"I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong.",Michael
That is something I would never do.,Meredith
"Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith.",Michael
"Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.",Meredith
"I ask... everyone in the room, 'Are you in a relationship?'.",Meredith
"People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.",Michael
"Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.",Kelly
Okay.,Ryan
"I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.",Michael
How does he feel about it?,Andy
He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.,Michael
Now you're just being hurtful.,Jim
"I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...",Michael
Hey!,Phyllis
On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.,Michael
Did Donna tell you that?,Andy
Real sports with Bryant Gumble.,Michael
So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.,Andy
You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.,Michael
"My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage.",Andy
So... here's the thing about infidelity.,Andy
"Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.",Michael
How does that work?,Andy
Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.,Michael
"In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce.",Andy
I am Beyonce always.,Michael
Not this time.,Andy
"Yes, I am.",Michael
"This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.",Andy
I would love that.,Michael
Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out.,Andy
I have work to do.,Michael
"Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.",Andy
Let's go. [starts walking towards the elevator] I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.,Michael
[humming Call to Post] Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum,Andy
"All right, Andy, please.",Michael
Baseball!,Andy
"Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.",Michael
Where?,Andy
Right there. The coach!,Michael
Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!,Andy
"Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?",Michael
"[announcer's voice] And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.",Andy
"All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?",Michael
Whatever. I'm the one blending in.,Andy
[ahem][Pam snores] Guys?,Gabe
Pam.,Jim
"Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.",Pam
Can you two please join me in my office? Now.,Gabe
You were supposed to be the Lookout.,Pam
"Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.",Jim
"I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad.",Gabe
Sorry about that.,Jim
So embarrassing.,Pam
"Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics.",Gabe
"Well, you were surprisingly restrained.",Jim
We will be well-rested tomorrow.,Pam
"Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.",Gabe
Excellent. Go for it.,Jim
"I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. [Jim and Pam struggling to stay awake] Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?",Gabe
"Right? So, uh, let's uh...",Jim
"Finally there's a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man, a la Benjamin Button.",Lawyer
Same page. Go to the next one.,Angela
Same page. Just keep moving.,Dwight
Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix--,Lawyer
Which we can't know.,Dwight
This is essentially...,Lawyer
Unless we're unplugged.,Dwight
Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor.,Lawyer
And wake up in the future.,Dwight
Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract.,Lawyer
What?,Dwight
"Look, I can't enforce that anybody have a child with anyone else.",Lawyer
What?,Angela
"So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000.",Lawyer
What?,Dwight
"I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.",Dwight
Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.,Andy
You have no idea what you're talking about.,Michael
I know it's like cricket.,Andy
"You don't. No, no.",Michael
"And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket.",Andy
"You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, 'Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?' 'High-five, Donna.' 'Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?' 'Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit.'",Michael
Seems pretty well liked by the team.,Andy
"Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary.",Michael
You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.,Andy
"I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.",Michael
"$30,000? There's gotta be another way.",Dwight
He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.,Angela
"Look, I will not pay.",Dwight
"Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]",Angela
Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?',Dwight
"Look, I don't think that's actually legal.",Lawyer
Agreed. [shakes hands with Angela],Dwight
"Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.",Dwight
But not in your bed. It's lumpy.,Dwight
"Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.",Angela
Fine. Five times. [signs contract],Dwight
"Look, I can't legally watch this unfold. It's coming a little dangerously close to prostitution.",Lawyer
I want eye contact.,Angela
No.,Dwight
Yes.,Angela
Do you understand how rare is that in nature?,Dwight
I'm not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera],Angela
"Great game, coach.",Andy
"Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't.",Michael
You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life.,Andy
"Yeah, right. You must be rootin' for the other guys.",Shane
Ha. The other guys can go die.,Andy
[whispers] Okay.,Michael
Baseball! Go talk to him.,Andy
No. God. You go talk to him.,Michael
Let's go.,Shane
Shane. Great game man!,Andy
Do I know you?,Shane
"No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.",Andy
"Are you somebody's... parents? Oh, are you guys... Kenny's dads?",Shane
Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball. [chuckles],Andy
Okay.,Shane
"But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.",Andy
Okay. Let's go!,Shane
Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.,Andy
Whoa!,Shane
"I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person.",Andy
"Hey, I'm really sorry, I'm just trying to... focus here on the game.",Shane
"I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.",Andy
Of course. Okay? I gotta... get back to this.,Shane
Of course.,Andy
All right.,Shane
"But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!",Andy
"No, no, no.",Michael
"Come on, get over here.",Andy
"I'm good. Oh, my God.",Michael
"Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.",Andy
Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.,Michael
It's all right. It's all right. Keep it going.,Shane
"Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, 'I'm sleeping with your wife.' And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.",Michael
"Okay, orange slices. There ya go.",Michael
"Thanks, Michael.",Erin
Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!,Michael
Why would you throw something wet at me?,Oscar
You love it. There ya go.,Michael
"Now, were those for the team?",Jim
"Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks.",Michael
Ah.,Jim
I don't think those were yours to take.,Pam
"Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.",Michael
"I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.",Andy
Did you talk to him?,Pam
I did.,Michael
You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.,Pam
Wow. That is crazy.,Kevin
Was there a fistfight?,Phyllis
No. We just talked. He's very nice.,Michael
And it didn't change your mind.,Phyllis
It did not.,Michael
"Michael, that's awful.",Phyllis
Isn't it?,Michael
Yes.,Phyllis
"I'm awful, aren't I?",Michael
Yeah. That's pretty bad.,Kevin
I'm an awful guy! Ooh!,Michael
How can you live with yourself?,Oscar
"I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.",Michael
"That is a dangerous game, friendo.",Kevin
"Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.",Kelly
I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.,Ryan
"Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?",Kelly
"All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'",Ryan
I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.,Kelly
I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming.,Ryan
That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday.,Kelly
"I don't care. I have an appetite for life! [eats cake] Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon.",Michael
"Good for you, man. Good for you.",Ryan
He takes what he wants.,Ryan
"You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.",Ryan
What about Kelly?,Erin
You read my mind.,Ryan
[quietly] Is this a joke?,Erin
Yep.,Ryan
"It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.",Ryan
"You'll learn, baby. You'll learn.",Michael
"[pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let's see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah!",Dwight
"[Michael leaving copy machine] Uh, boss, we're out of paper.",Creed
"Yeah, I noticed that.",Michael
Are you gonna add any more?,Creed
Nope.,Michael
He don't give an 'F' about nothin'!,Creed
I have got big balls.,Michael
I don't think I'm gonna make it.,Pam
[yawning] What about an energy drink or something?,Jim
"[shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.",Pam
"Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.",Jim
"Well, it does and it doesn't.",Pam
"Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place.",Darryl
A place?,Jim
A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.,Darryl
You sleep in the warehouse?,Pam
"Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?",Darryl
Okay.,Jim
Pam.,Darryl
Okay.,Pam
For your signature. [drops document on Michael's desk],Phyllis
"Okay. [Phyllis avoids looking at Michael] Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. [continues to look away] Phyllis, look at-- [Phyllis turns to leave] okay, that's... [chases after her] All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.",Michael
Why not your condo?,Kevin
"Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate.",Michael
"Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.",Stanley
"Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.",Michael
Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.,Andy
Nobody better try to stop me. Good. [leaves the office. door closes],Michael
I could have stopped him.,Dwight
Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse],Dwight
No.,Angela
"God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound]",Dwight
What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location],Angela
Never mind. Just never mind.,Dwight
"Well, it better work.",Angela
"Oh, it'll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.",Dwight
"[driving in car; returns to office; grabs ice cream out of freezer] How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. [beeping; cut to Donna who is waiting in the parking lot of the motel] Like a grownup.[Donna receives text from phone] That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision. [Donna has disappointed look; cut back to Michael in his office opening ice cream] At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former.",Michael
Michael Scott?,Reporter
Yes?,Michael
Do you wanna make a comment on the rumors?,Reporter
"[sighs] Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.",Michael
I'm talking about the Sabre printers that catch on fire.,Reporter
Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?,Michael
"[on Youtube video] There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed. [phone rings, Michael picks it up] Michael Scott, as seen on TV.",Michael
[high-pitched voice] I saw you on the news and I want to pinch your tiny wiener... [normal voice] It's Packer!,Todd Packer
"OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!",Michael
"Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I'm like, what? All right. So I do it. It's on TV last night. And it's in the paper today. And it's online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It's like, come on, people, enough.",Michael
"Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site.",Michael
What's number one?,Oscar
"Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.",Michael
"So instead of working, you want...",Jim
Yes.,Michael
Okay.,Jim
Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it!,Michael
"Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!",Angela
"Awww, it's kissing its mommy!",Phyllis
Please.,Michael
"Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.",Dwight
"Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It's not even that interesting a baby otter, it can't even stand up. [looks toward computer] It's trying to stand up... [choking up] there it goes.",Michael
Howdy. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.,Jo
Jo! We were not expecting you!,Michael
"Course you all, no doubt, know why I'm here.",Jo
No.,Kevin
"Turns out our printers are famous. They're all over the news. It's an interesting story. Cheap foreign printers attacking innocent Americans. Well, actually the, the real story isn't quite as racy, but uh... let's give it a go.",Jo
"Jo, I think that I know what happened.",Kevin
"I'm not sure you do, teddy bear.",Jo
"Well, now I think I might not.",Kevin
"Not long ago, we discovered a defect in one of our printers, so we got a software patch and fixed it right up, just like that. I don't know how it works. But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers, giving 'em free toner, and we keep 'em, happy, but somebody here, they liked that first story better. The one where we lose half our clients for no damn good reason! Whoever it was who talked to the press, they should come forward, please.",Jo
"Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.",Michael
Can you now?,Jo
"Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.",Michael
"[quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae.",Phyllis
"If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets.",Andy
"So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us. [sings] Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?",Andy
"[as Gabe hands out forms to everyone] It's a little form, says 'I did not do it.'",Jo
"There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like...",Michael
"All that's just birthday information, Michael.",Jo
"Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.",Michael
"Why don't you come with me? We'll start out with the honcho, what'cha say?",Jo
Okay.,Michael
"When Mama was working as a prison guard and something went missing, she'd ask one question: What do we do when we find the guilty party? And if they said, 'Come down on him with that swift hammer of justice!', innocent. A clear conscience don't need no mercy. But if they said 'Officer Bessie, well they may have had a reason, blah blah blah blah', well nine times out of ten, that's the anus they'd check.",Jo
"So say we catch this whistleblower, what do you think I should do with him?",Jo
"We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda.",Michael
"Uh, that's, uh, Guantanamo Bay.",Jo
"Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.",Michael
"Well, I guess we're all right, Michael.",Jo
"I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right.",Michael
Yeah.,Jo
Okay.,Michael
Hey Dwight.,Nick
"Hey, IT guy.",Dwight
Mind if I get in there for a second?,Nick
"Oh, sure thing, go ahead.",Dwight
"Just one... [Dwight pushes Nick's neck to the desk and pushes his arm up] Gah! Ah! Dwight, what the hell?",Nick
"Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?",Dwight
"The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.",Oscar
"You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.",Dwight
"Wait, are they searching all our computers?",Kevin
"Yeah. [Kevin runs to his desk] I already got to yours, Kevin. [Kevin runs back]",Nick
"No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner.",Kevin
"Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!",Angela
"Ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers.",Michael
"Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.",Phyllis
Okay Dwight.,Jo
"Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... [hands Jo a piece of paper] You should fire the following people.",Dwight
"Well, I'm inclined to believe you.",Jo
Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?,Dwight
"Yeah, I noticed you've had a great year. Good boy... you turning that money into more money?",Jo
Are you referring to alchemy?,Dwight
"I don't like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you ain't investing in property, then you're dumber than a dummy.",Jo
I'm not dumb. I'm smart.,Dwight
"Well, buy property. That's my advice.",Jo
Is there something that you would like to say to me?,Michael
Uh...,Andy
About talking to the press?,Michael
"I, I didn't know. I didn't do that!",Andy
Mmhmm.,Michael
"Okay? I, I... didn't do it.",Andy
I don't believe you.,Michael
I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet.,Andy
"That's a little much. All right, all right, all right.",Michael
"I don't care, that's how much I swear!",Andy
"Okay, I believe you, I believe you.",Michael
I don't know who's giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.,Andy
Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?,Michael
"Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.",Darryl
"Oh, no, no, no...",Michael
"I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib.",Darryl
Oh my god. Was she cute?,Michael
No.,Darryl
"Oh, god, Darryl!",Michael
"I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don't know what is.",Michael
Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was.,Jo
"Well, that's...",Toby
And we didn't find anything on your computer.,Jo
Good.,Toby
Except this. [hands stack of paper to Toby],Jo
"Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I've been working on.",Toby
"I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. I'm just curious, why would a man who hates people want to have a relationship with a maid?",Jo
"Oh, uh, I don't know, uh...",Toby
"The way I look at it, there's only one of two reasons. He knows a secret about her that she doesn't know herself, or he wants to use her services to mop up after a murder.",Jo
Oh... yes.,Toby
Write your own damn novel.,Toby
It was me.,Pam
What was you? You were the leak?,Jim
Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...,Pam
Uh-huh.,Jim
"She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!",Pam
Why'd you do that?,Jim
Her husband's a reporter.,Pam
Yeah.,Jim
"So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do.",Pam
"Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.",Jim
I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.,Pam
This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.,Jim
You leaked it?,Michael
"I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!",Pam
"I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour.",Michael
That fast?,Pam
Oh.,Michael
Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.,Michael
"[Michael knocks on Pam's desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.",Pam
So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes.,Michael
"Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it.",Pam
[in Meredith's van] I have never seen so many parking tickets.,Pam
"All right, this is just messed up.",Darryl
"No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in here is what's messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think.",Michael
All right.,Darryl
What do we got?,Michael
Um...,Pam
"[opening door] Hey guys, sorry I'm late.",Kelly
We're not going for yogurt.,Pam
"It's okay, she's cool, she also whistle-blew.",Michael
"Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.",Kelly
"Hey, hey, it's as interesting as a morgue.",Michael
"Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof...",Kelly
"Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. [types on his phone] I just sent myself a Woof. [fax machine makes noise, several windows pop up on computer behind Ryan with accompanying sounds, including barking]",Ryan
"[on phone] Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.",Erin
"Thank you, Erin. Woof!",Ryan
"Okay, here's what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case.",Michael
Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?,Pam
"No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.",Michael
That idea sucks.,Kelly
I don't think that's a good idea.,Pam
Just don't say no.,Michael
"Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.",Darryl
"Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.",Kelly
"That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just...",Michael
"Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.",Pam
Okay. You can count on me.,Michael
[sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand.,Dwight
I'm hungry.,Toby
"Ready? [they pull the vending machine towards them; Dwight's phone rings] Got it? Oh shoot. Got it? [walks away, opens phone] Dwight Schrute.",Dwight
"[on phone] The property you're looking at is in great shape. By the way, it has a very spacious basement office.",Realtor
Basement office? You mean like a lair?,Dwight
Hey Jo.,Michael
Michael.,Jo
"I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it.",Michael
Michael Scott... what do you know?,Jo
What?,Michael
It doesn't matter what I know.,Michael
"If it doesn't matter, then tell me.",Jo
Why?,Michael
Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it.,Jo
"Well, deal with this. [crosses arms]",Michael
"Empathize with me for a moment. I came up here with a big problem, and now I got a branch manager who's giving me the silent treatment... Speak to me... speak. [Jo's dog barks] Come with me.",Jo
What?,Michael
"[as Michael and Jo leave] Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation?",Gabe
Are you going to kill me?,Michael
Hahahahahaha.,Jo
[on phone] I just need you to come by later and sign a few forms.,Realtor
Okay.,Dwight
"What time works for you? [Dwight looks across the street] Mr. Schrute, what time works?",Realtor
"Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it.",Dwight
But... [Dwight closes phone],Realtor
"[on Jo's jet] Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police.",Michael
I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you.,Creed
"All right. Uh, Stan, you're up.",Gabe
It wasn't me.,Stanley
"What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And... you did it. [nods at Andy]",Gabe
What? Based on what?,Andy
"Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?",Gabe
All right. Sounds good.,Dwight
"Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.",Jim
"Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim.",Andy
Really?,Jim
Michael.,Jo
I have rights.,Michael
Let's just talk.,Jo
I am not going to tell you anything.,Michael
"Honey, you don't seem like your normal self.",Jo
"Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch.",Michael
Mama Jo knew there was something up.,Jo
"Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.",Michael
"Oh, I hate that.",Jo
"And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.",Michael
Who's Holly?,Jo
Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.,Michael
"Well, I think that the real question is: Who is the whistleblower?",Kevin
"Oh, just...",Dwight
"I may have heard from an old client, and I may have immediately started spreading the news to other clients and potential clients, yeah. But I'm not here to talk about that. I am here to talk about Suck It. Suck it.",David Wallace
"Gabe, I told you all about the printers.",Andy
"I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.",Jim
"Yes, it's totally obvious.",Pam
"I think we all can agree that it's either Gabe or Angela. [flips a coin] It's Angela. Get her, boys.",Creed
"Hey guys, uh, sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone. Through Teach for America, I'm going to go down to Detroit and teach, uh, inner city kids about computers.",Nick
"Uh, not now.",Gabe
"Oh yeah, it's just that my friends are in the car waiting, so I thought I would...",Nick
"[quietly] Phyllis, what's this guy's name again?",Stanley
"I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...",Phyllis
My name is Nick.,Nick
"Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting.",Angela
"Okay, look, I get it, people. I'm the lame IT guy, and everybody hates me.",Nick
"Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.",Jim
"You called me man? I just said my name just now, did you forget it already?",Nick
No... sport.,Jim
"You, you guys have fifteen parties a week, you can't learn my name?",Nick
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.",Dwight
"Thank you so much for that. I saw all your hard drives, and guess what? [gestures to Ryan] You're not a photographer. [gestures to Kelly] And you definitely can't fit into a size two. Darryl, man, you're on Facebook. Why you been telling people you're not on Facebook? People want to be your friend, man! All right? And you. [points to Andy] This guy, you're the one who told the press. You wrote an e-mail to the editor. I saw it, and I also saw a QuickTime movie of your little printer fire test on your hard drive. This guy's the snitch, he's the snitch. So that's it, check it out. [gives the finger]",Nick
You're going to believe that guy?,Andy
"When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I'd break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there... and they'd make a Barbie out of me.",Jo
"Hmm, hmm.",Michael
"I, did I sell cheap printers? I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press and make one of them public apology recalls, I mean, it's all I'll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie.",Jo
"You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.",Michael
"Oh honey, surely you don't want that.",Jo
"I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. [Jo laughs] You were playing too.",Michael
"I'm about to buy this building, you know.",Dwight
You don't say? I own a one-eighth share in a rental property down in Pittston.,Hank
"Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.",Dwight
"Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?",Andy
[points to the ceiling] You deserve it.,Phyllis
"Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I...",Andy
"[offscreen] No, it does not!",Kevin
"Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.",Andy
It does!,Angela
Andy?,Erin
Hey.,Andy
I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.,Erin
"Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.",Andy
Yeah.,Erin
"[to press] We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?",Michael
"Hey, I appreciate you reading that statement. You looked pretty up there.",Jo
That was fun.,Michael
I hope your rough patch ends soon.,Jo
Thanks. Today helped.,Michael
"Well, give me a shout if I can brighten your life.",Jo
"Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.",Michael
Let me see what I can do.,Jo
"[to Toby, who's filming] You fallin' behind.",Stanley
[jumps in front of camera] Wuphf.com!,Ryan
"Ryan, we're doing the dance!",Kelly
This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.,Ryan
[Bluetooth rings] You got Creed.,Creed
-and you jump in front of them.,Ryan
You make it so hard to love you sometimes.,Kelly
Still behind.,Stanley
[closing door] I said I didn't want to be on the internet!,Angela
"Go, go, go, go!",Andy
[performs magic-tricks while lip-syncing],Michael
Streamers! [everyone throws streamers in the air and starts dancing],All
"Hiya! Ha! [climbs on Phyllis' desk and starts kicking things off, bites off the head of a stuffed animal]",Dwight
Dwight! [Dwight pulls out a hunting knife and jumps off desk],Phyllis
Are you crazy?,Stanley
"[song ends] Toby, how did we do?",Andy
"Well, that was better.",Toby
Whoo! We did it! [everyone starts cheering],Andy
"I suppose summer had to end sometime. It's sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw 'Inception.' Or at least I dreamt I did.",Michael
"Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there.",Andy
"Yes, of course.",Erin
"And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher.",Andy
Who's the guy who invented the peanut?,Erin
"Hey, guys.",Gabe
Hey!,Andy
"Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.",Gabe
Not at all.,Andy
I'm gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao. [he and Erin kiss],Gabe
"I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite.",Gabe
"Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great.",Erin
"Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe.",Andy
[goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?,Pam
"From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.",Dwight
"Well, what if you're cold?",Kevin
"Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.",Dwight
"Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people. Oh, you did hear.",Jim
"[drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably. Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.",Dwight
"Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.",Dwight
"This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, 'Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?' And I'd be like, 'blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah,' giving you the exact right answer.",Kelly
Coffee Monkey's arrived.,Luke
The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.,Oscar
"Here you go, Big O. Tiny. [hands Kevin his coffee] Darryl Hannah.",Luke
It says decaf. You get me decaf?,Darryl
"Ooh, yeah. Must've been some sort of mix-up there. You could just drink it, or I could drive all the way back?",Luke
"My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him.",Darryl
"New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.",Andy
My name is Luke Cooper. I love cinema. My favorite movies are Citizen Kane and The Boondock Saints.,Luke
"That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael.",Andy
"He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. [starts drinking coffee] Ah! It's not cappuccino.",Michael
He messed yours up to.,Oscar
"He's got to go, Mike.",Darryl
"It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?",Michael
"Wow, that's a lot of keys.",Jim
"The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.",Dwight
"That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.",Jim
Where?,Dwight
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope],Jim
Give me that.,Dwight
"Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]",Jim
Yes.,Dwight
Go get 'em.,Jim
"What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.",Jim
"[Jim quietly takes Dwight's keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.",Dwight
Sorry.,Pam
"Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...",Jim
It was really funny.,Pam
"Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.",Jim
I love you.,Pam
Luke? Luke!,Phyllis
"What's up, Venus?",Luke
Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.,Phyllis
"Uh, if you asked me to do it, I'm sure I did it. Yeah, strawberries are ripe.",Luke
"Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp.",Meredith
You don't have to yell.,Luke
"Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.",Michael
What for?,Luke
To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great.,Michael
"And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew.",Michael
"Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years a- 14. The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of 'Ace Ventura II' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest.",Michael
Don't bother Luke.,Michael
Why is there a circle with a line through it?,Pam
"That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?",Michael
"Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke.",Phyllis
"No, it... Yes, okay, right. [erases don't] All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go. [writes 'Don't' in front of symbol]",Michael
Don't don't bother Luke. Got it.,Darryl
"Come on. Okay, um... [draws a circle around 'Don't' with a line through it] That's as clear as I can make it.",Michael
"Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.",Phyllis
Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.,Michael
Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?,Dwight
"That'd be hilarious. Uh, 'Jo, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop 'em.'",Gabe
"Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.",Michael
How close?,Dwight
"Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?",Michael
Yes. Of course.,Dwight
"Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related.",Toby
"No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes he is. He's my nephew.",Michael
What?,All
Luke is my nephew.,Michael
"Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew.",Oscar
"Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.",Michael
What's wrong with a level playing field?,Darryl
Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.,Michael
"Oh, man, so many points being made.",Jim
"I couldn't care less about nepotism. But, I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I've got a front row seat.",Creed
"God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.",Michael
That's a really tight argument.,Erin
Thank you.,Michael
But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.,Jim
"No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?",Michael
This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.,Oscar
"Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism. He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!",Michael
"I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.",Kelly
"If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?",Oscar
"Because I wanted you to come to me and say, 'Wow, he is so great.' And I was gonna say, 'Well, it's in the genes.' And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.",Michael
Hey! Ice cream afternoon!,Erin
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!,Michael
"Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?",Kevin
Or enough for everyone?,Pam
"No, man. There was no list. Uh, but I got bagel chips.",Luke
"Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.",Oscar
"Clutch cream run, bro.",Andy
"Get whatever you want, on me.",Pam
You really think you can make it up to me with food?,Jim
I don't know. That usually works.,Pam
"I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right.",Pam
I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car.,Angela
"Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!",Michael
"Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.",Phyllis
"All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.",Michael
"Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, 'I don't own an Ebay store,' so...",Jim
"Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.",Michael
"Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.",Oscar
Let's just make this kid open this damn car.,Stanley
"Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.",Erin
I'm reconsidering sending them back anyway.,Michael
"You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A.",Andy
Wait a minute.,Michael
[breaks into the car] I'm in.,Meredith
"Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony.",Michael
"Yep, here they are.",Oscar
"Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.",Phyllis
"This kid's costing us sales, Michael.",Andy
"I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.",Erin
"No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit.",Michael
"Why is this my problem, Michael?",Jo
Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.,Michael
"Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable.",Gabe
"Lower yourself, Gabe. I don't wanna be having a conversation with your crotch. Ok, educate me now why you won't fire the boy.",Jo
You don't have all the facts.,Michael
Which are?,Jo
I love him.,Michael
"Oh, God. How far has it gone?",Jo
No. No. He's my nephew.,Michael
"Well, I got a nephew too. But he don't work for me. You know why? Cause he's a screw-up. He can swim in my pool but he can't come in my house.",Jo
"Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.",Michael
"If you keep him, Michael, I'm gonna hold you accountable for him. You're on the hook for this kid. You got that? Cover his ass like tighty-whities.",Jo
I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.,Michael
"Was how I put it not clear enough? I mean, you had to go and make up your own saying? Deal with it, boys.",Jo
"Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other.",Michael
"Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.",Kevin
"Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses 'Doors closed' the doors open. Or he presses 'lobby' it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?",Pam
Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.,Kevin
Dwight is about to get so Pammed.,Pam
"Hey, did you SMS text message me?",Dwight
"Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.",Pam
"[as elevator doors won't shut] Okay, that's weird. Just hitting 'door closed.' What?",Dwight
There we go.,Pam
"Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! [elevator stops between floors] Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.",Dwight
Let's just calm down.,Pam
"Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.",Dwight
I don't-,Pam
Use your talons! Pry 'em open! [starts to urinate in elevator corner],Dwight
"Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!",Pam
"Well, don't look, freak!",Dwight
"Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!",Pam
I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!,Dwight
You've gotta be kidding me.,Pam
"Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no! [Luke points laser at Oscar's forehead] Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar's head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!",Michael
What? I'm stopping it. That's what you said.,Luke
Give me the pointer.,Michael
So you just want me to move it? You're being totally unclear here. I'm just gonna go ahead and move it. [points it at Angela's chest],Luke
"No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously.",Michael
"All right, fine. Fine. I'll just go.",Luke
Okay.,Michael
I'm gone.,Luke
"All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we're starting with account setup-",Michael
"Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye.",Andy
"Michael, do something.",Angela
"Sack up, man.",Meredith
"Okay, can I have that?",Michael
No.,Luke
"Ok, I am going to count down from five.",Michael
"Five, four...",Both
I'm not kidding.,Michael
"Three, two, one.",Both
"Give-okay. Alright, give it up.",Michael
No!,Luke
"[bending Luke over desk, spanking him repeatedly] You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!",Michael
What the?,Luke
"That's what you're going to do, Luke!",Michael
What the hell was that?,Luke
I had to do that.,Michael
"Hey, [bleep] this! Screw it!",Luke
All right. Are we good? [Luke runs out crying] You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.,Michael
That was awesome!,Kevin
Texas justice.,Stanley
"Yeah, your nephew is so lame.",Kelly
"He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean.",Creed
You follow him on Twitter?,Jim
Everywhere I look it's Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that's not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him.,Creed
"Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private?",Gabe
"Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?",Michael
Pam?,Jim
"Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.",Pam
I did not do this.,Jim
"I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.",Pam
This is impressive.,Jim
"Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.",Pam
Do they call you that?,Jim
They do call me that.,Pam
"Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.",Jim
"Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor.",Pam
"Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?",Jim
Yeah.,Pam
Great.,Jim
How ya doin'?,Dwight
Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.,Jim
Stop drinking the water! Stop!,Pam
"[Phyllis and Andy act out Luke getting spanked] No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.",Andy
"Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn't. These things seldom work out. I don't know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think they'd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hat's off to them.",Michael
[Dwight starts aggressively spanking Andy] Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!,Andy
Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst. You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.,Gabe
That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery.,Michael
"Good. Well, that's the spirit.",Gabe
I can do that.,Michael
"And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors.",Gabe
"Okay. Wait, what?",Michael
"Yeah, I'm really looking forward to working with you, Michael.",Toby
Is there another option?,Michael
"The alternative is termination. [Michael stares off, considering termination...]",Gabe
Wow. Late every day this week.,Dwight
We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic...,Pam
Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?,Dwight
Is there really?,Jim
"Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.",Dwight
Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.,Dwight
Aaah!,Jim
Aaah!,Mose
You remember my cousin Mose.,Dwight
Welcome children.,Mose
Were you painting in the dark?,Pam
Wait. Is this your place Dwight?,Jim
Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?,Dwight
I don't really think we need...,Pam
Oh... lets take the tour Pam.,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim.,Dwight
These are actually forks and knives from the break room.,Jim
"Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork.",Dwight
And a soy sauce packet.,Pam
Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.,Dwight
Don't beat yourself up.,Jim
"We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.",Dwight
Who will be watching the children?,Jim
No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.,Dwight
Prove it.,Jim
What?,Dwight
"Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.",Jim
"Oh no, no, no.",Dwight
"But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.",Jim
"I promise you, that door locks! [Jim closes the door]",Dwight
What's something that you...,Toby
This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!,Michael
"Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell.",Michael
"Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but I've got a chance to do some good here.",Toby
I know what you want to ask me. 'Did your mom ever see you naked?',Michael
We can do this with more privacy.,Toby
"So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.",Michael
"Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!",Dwight
The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?,Phyllis
"All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!",Dwight
America is one big mall.,Ryan
Did something happen Dwight?,Jim
"Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.",Dwight
"Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board.",Andy
You don't want to know.,Dwight
"I'd like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it's the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons.",Toby
"I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid.",Phyllis
"[on phone] Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.",Pam
Pam?,Jim
"I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.",Pam
Everything is going to be ok.,Jim
Tell me I'm good at sales.,Pam
You're good... you're good at sales.,Jim
"The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair.",Pam
Dwight?,Andy
What?,Dwight
Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the 'F' word?,Andy
Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.,Dwight
No you will not.,Stanley
"Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're 'appearance'ists!",Dwight
"Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?",Jim
"Yeah, what happened Dwight?",Pam
Ok.,Jim
"You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...",Dwight
So what happened?,Pam
"I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.",Dwight
"You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to 'Pretty Woman' their asses.",Kelly
We should start our own mall!,Creed
Yeah!,Erin
"Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.",Jim
What did I say?,Kelly
"I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out.",Kelly
"Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.",Jim
"No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you.",Andy
Ok,Dwight
Alright.,Jim
Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? [removes cuff link] How about now? [removes other cuff link] How about now? [removes tie clip] How about now?,Andy
Uh... what was your favorite flavor of...,Toby
One hour.,Michael
What?,Toby
"One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.",Michael
"Ok, I can't count the hour if you don't talk.",Toby
"No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.",Michael
"Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, and I can't do that unless I honestly...",Toby
"You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?",Michael
Tell me!,Toby
I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.,Toby
"Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby.",Michael
"Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl...",Dwight
Pretty Woman.,Andy
"Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?",Dwight
"No, no. I want to hear you tell it.",Jim
"Ok, Um... The sex worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the 'trappings' of extravagant wealth, but instead of going...",Dwight
"Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she's like,' I was in here yesterday and you wouldn't help me.' And the shop girl goes, 'ok'. And Julia Roberts goes,' You girls work on commission, right?' And the girl is like,'Yeah', and Julia Roberts goes...",Andy
Big mistake! Huge!',Kelly
I was telling that... I was telling that.,Andy
"How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure.",Stanley
Who can I speak to in this office about saving on window treatments?,Window treatment guy
I don't know.,Erin
Is one of you the office administrator?,Window treatment guy
[hesitates] I am. I am the office administrator!,Pam
Can I show you a few samples?,Window treatment guy
"Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all.",Pam
There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.,Pam
"Toby, can I really tell you anything?",Michael
Of course.,Toby
"Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half.",Michael
Office Administrator. So when did this happen?,Oscar
"A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?",Pam
"Yeah, totally. Well, congrats!",Oscar
"Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?",Pam
"Totally, that's great.",Oscar
"I get paid $40,000 per year.",Pam
Great.,Oscar
"Maybe $50,000.",Pam
"$50,000?",Oscar
"No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500.",Pam
That's great.,Oscar
"Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.",Jim
A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.,Andy
Is he still doing his boycott?,Stanley
"No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?",Jim
You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo.,Kelly
Agreed.,Jim
Really?,Dwight
Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.,Oscar
Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?,Dwight
"The glasses are a little... [Dwight drops glasses to the floor, stomps on them]",Ryan
I liked them.,Pam
I thought they were kind of cute.,Kelly
"Yeah, I liked them too.",Ryan
I can't see.,Dwight
"Say stuff like, 'Good morning, Good Afternoon'. People appreciate that.",Darryl
"Wait, I see you every day. Can I say 'Good month?'",Dwight
I'm telling you how to do this man.,Darryl
"If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you.",Andy
Please and thank you go a long way.,Angel
Copy. Thank you.,Dwight
Thank you.,Angela
Please.,Dwight
[in a cockney accent] I think he's got it!,Andy
"And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight? [howls and growls like a werewolf]",Michael
Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.,Toby
"Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that? [pause] Three hours. We're half way done.",Michael
Oh.,Toby
"Hey, do you have a second?",Pam
Yeah.,Gabe
"Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.",Pam
"Right, of course!",Gabe
"And, I haven't gotten paid yet. I'm not blaming you.",Pam
Thank you so much.,Gabe
I just think somebody lost the paperwork.,Pam
Oh boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?,Gabe
Yes. Absolutely. Right away.,Pam
"You know what Michael? You're right. You win. This is pointless. We're not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don't we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?",Toby
[fanfare],Andy
"We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.",Jim
Go get 'em Dwight.,Phyllis
Wish us luck!,Jim
Thank you.,Dwight
"Dwight [snaps a picture with a disposable camera, then drops the camera in the trash can]",Erin
"Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today.",Erin
We can play something more complicated if you like.,Toby
This is plenty complicated.,Michael
So you have played it before?,Toby
I've played it once or twice with Jeff.,Michael
Who's Jeff?,Toby
"Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married.",Michael
"So, her husband, your stepdad?",Toby
"Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though.",Michael
Did you guys do much stuff together?,Toby
"Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.",Michael
It's working. I'm doing it!,Toby
[coughs for attention],Angela
What?,Dwight
My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit],Angela
Do you have your card?,Dwight
Yes. Don't forget the pipe.,Angela
Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?,Toby
"I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.",Michael
Why?,Toby
I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.,Michael
Dogs don't do that.,Toby
Right. Why would a dog do that? That's silly.,Michael
I don't know.,Toby
"When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I've never said it out loud, so...",Michael
"It's very important for you to be liked, isn't it?",Toby
"Well, lets not get too... This isn't a counseling session... Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.",Michael
I'm just trying to help you Michael.,Toby
You. Bitch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?,Michael
I just want to...,Toby
You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry?,Michael
[tossing forms at Michael] Just fill them out any way you want.,Toby
Ok.,Michael
I'll have Erin fax them back to corporate.,Toby
You'll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these [giving Toby two middle fingers] and call me in the morning.,Michael
"Hey Michael, um... about three months ago, I was talking to... [Michael grabs form and signs it without reading.]",Pam
"There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.",Pam
"So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?",Gabe
Yes.,Toby
That is not how it seems to me.,Gabe
He seems fine.,Toby
"You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior.",Gabe
Heh.,Toby
I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.,Darryl
We can do that.,Pam
Right in here?,Darryl
Easily.,Pam
"I'm back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem.",Gabe
But of course!,Pam
Great.,Gabe
"The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator.",Gabe
So weird that there is no paperwork.,Pam
At all.,Gabe
"Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.",Pam
"Pam, I don't want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it's supposed to be. Can you just admit... admit...",Gabe
Admit what?,Pam
I don't want to say it.,Gabe
Say it.,Pam
Mm-hmm.,Gabe
"Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.",Pam
"Statements of such nature, while they have their place, are overused in a competitive business environment.",Gabe
"Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.",Pam
Will do... Can I get one of those name plates... that says Gabe Lewis?,Gabe
Sure. Anything else?,Pam
Nope.,Gabe
I'll get it right away.,Pam
"The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.",Pam
Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.,Jim
It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.,Dwight
"Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.",Jim
Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge.,Dwight
That's it.,Jim
Let me know if I can help you with anything.,Salesman
Excuse me sir.,Dwight
Yes?,Salesman
"I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.",Dwight
"I remember, yes. I'm terribly sorry about that.",Salesman
"You work on commission, don't you?",Dwight
"Stop, stop, stop.",Jim
"No, we don't.",Salesman
Did you just say you remember him?,Jim
"Of course, but he looks much less threatening now.",Salesman
What does that mean?,Jim
We had a safety concern. Um... we very politely indicated that he'd be welcome back...,Salesman
Good Morning!,Dwight
If he were in accordance with our dress policy.,Salesman
What?,Dwight
But the blood stained hands...,Salesman
It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...,Dwight
I'm very sorry.,Salesman
Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!,Dwight
Lets just go.,Jim
You made a big mistake. Huge!,Dwight
There it is. Alright.,Jim
Aaah!,Dwight
That's pretty good.,Jim
After you.,Andy
[re-entering the store] I'll take the wizard!,Dwight
"Oh, ok!",Salesman
You forged them! You forged the forms!,Michael
You filled them in and faxed them yourself!,Toby
Yes.,Michael
You remember that.,Toby
"Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.",Michael
Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose.,Toby
"You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet... [mimicking Gabe] 'I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I'm here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!' [normal voice] Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let's do it to it!",Michael
Andy? [Andy starts boombox and begins singing 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd'],Erin
Yes! [as other costumed actors come in and join Andy in song],Jim
Did you write this?,Erin
No.,Andy
Who did?,Erin
Steven Sondheim.,Andy
Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing],Erin
What the hell is happening?,Angela
We're the cast of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. We open in a couple weeks at the Loose Screw Playhouse here in Scranton and today just doing a wee bit of viral marketing.,Andy
[cheers loudly after cast finishes singing song] That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?,Michael
Like a month ago.,Andy
Really? They didn't call me. Who am I playing? ...Andy?,Michael
Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. It's closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scranton's Miss Fitness pageant.,Andy
I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.,Erin
What? That's awful. Everyone's gonna miss that guy.,Andy
"Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It's so powerful, even a lot of men can't resist a man singing show tunes.",Andy
"Oh, who else is going?",Erin
Everyone.,Andy
Gabe seemed to think no one was going.,Erin
"What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right?",Andy
"Andy, what time's the show?",Michael
8pm sharp.,Andy
How long is it?,Michael
Hour forty-five.,Andy
"Nope, can't make it.",Michael
"They say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast Andy's play, they took mine.",Michael
"Jim, Pam, you guys are in, right?",Andy
"Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry.",Pam
Dwight?,Andy
"Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.",Dwight
It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.,Andy
"I can't Andy, it's too hard. That's-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?",Michael
"If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer.",Andy
Wow.,Michael
This guy's like world-class. You should not feel bad. I'm asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?,Andy
"I wish I could, Andy, but I can't. I have plans that night. I'm going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You're that friend. I'm going to see your play.",Michael
Noishe!,Andy
And scene.,Michael
"Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight.",Angela
"Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe.",Dwight
Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.,Dwight
Give me the punch card.,Dwight
"No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.",Angela
That is not in the contract.,Dwight
"Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause. Do you want to re-mediate?",Angela
"Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape.",Dwight
Thank you.,Angela
"Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object. [faint smile]",Angela
"Hey, how are those salads?",Andy
It's my own fault-,Jim
"My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could...",Andy
We'll keep looking.,Pam
Yes!,Andy
Really?,Jim
"I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.",Pam
"Oh my gosh, that would be amazing.",Andy
Yeah.,Pam
For a lot of reasons.,Jim
"Yeah, I know. Neiche!",Andy
"Oh, hey guys.",Michael
You brought balloons to a play?,Stanley
"I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers.",Michael
"It's nice, like Up.",Phyllis
Yes.,Michael
"Excuse me, are you the guy who did an entire Law & Order episode for his audition?",Usher
Nope.,Michael
Guys?,Andy
Hey! Andy!,All
"You all made it, thank you so much.",Andy
"You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit.",Jim
She's babysitting?,Andy
"I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club.",Erin
"I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her.",Andy
[trying to stuff balloons below the seats] This is ridiculous. You'd think they'd discourage people from bringing in balloons.,Michael
"Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber.",Darryl
"No, Darryl. This guy's a world-class actor. He doesn't daylight as your plumber.",Michael
"No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition.",Darryl
Are you kidding me?,Michael
"Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later.",Darryl
"All right, I'm sorry. God.",Michael
"Excuse me, I think you may be in the wrong seats. [Jim and Pam move a few rows back, next to Michael]",Usher
Ooooh!,Kelly
[whispering to man sitting beside him] I work with that guy.,Dwight
[after taking her gum out] Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.,Angela
Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss.,Dwight
"Oh, Dwight, just move.",Angela
[whispering to man sitting beside him] His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.,Dwight
What time is it? [Ryan pulls up a large analog clock on his iPad],Kelly
"Michael! Shelby Thomas Weemes, the director.",Shelby
Hello.,Michael
I promise you that if you keep auditioning with similar gusto...,Shelby
Okay.,Michael
We are going to find a production with a role for Michael Scott.,Shelby
Okay.,Michael
Yes?,Shelby
Yes.,Michael
Good.,Shelby
Good.,Michael
Enjoy the second act.,Shelby
You enjoy the second act.,Michael
Have a refreshment.,Shelby
"Thank you. You, too. [steals a bottle of wine from the bar]",Michael
"Come on, Dwight.",Angela
Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?,Dwight
These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.,Angela
Let's go.,Dwight
"Hey, Erin, it's Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don't put Cece on the phone, because she can't talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything's going. Yeah? Yeah? It's good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine!",Pam
Everything's fine.,Jim
We can relax.,Pam
We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.,Jim
"[seeing Michael drink from wine bottle] Michael! [bottle gets passed around by Darryl, Meredith and Kevin]",Meredith
Just checking my e-mails. See if I got any last-minute 'break a legs' or 'I still love you' type texts. Doesn't look like I got anything. Maybe on my Facebook wall.,Andy
"[on cell phone] Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production of Sweeney Todd, the real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph.",Creed
Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! I found her!,Andy
You found Johanna.,Sweeney Todd
That monster of a judge has locked her-[cell phone chiming]. Locked her away. [phone continues ringing],Andy
There's a little bird fluttering around. Do hope it ceases chirping. [audience laughs],Sweeney Todd
How is that funny?,Michael
"The bird continues to call. Someone please turn off your... bird. Oh, for the love-turn your phone off! There are signs!",Sweeney Todd
"Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. He's gone to sleep now, I've closed his beak. [Michael laughs]",Andy
What is the news of my darling daughter Johanna?,Sweeney Todd
"[text message chime] You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you're a barber, so that's legit. So there's that. But...",Andy
[yelling] Where is Johanna?,Sweeney Todd
A madhouse.,Andy
A madhouse?,Sweeney Todd
"Yes, a madhouse.",Andy
"A madhouse? Johanna is as good as rescued. Where do you suppose all the wig makes of London go to obtain their human hair? [Michael tips over wine bottle, which noisily rolls down the theater, and accidentally lets go of balloons]",Sweeney Todd
"Do you think... [bottle rolling] so you think... [bottle rolling, clanking]",Andy
"Fogg's Asylum , why not? [balloon pops, Kelly screams and baby starts crying]",Sweeney Todd
Sounds like Cece.,Pam
"Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.",Jim
"[sees Erin holding Cece] Oh, my God! Go, go!",Pam
"Oh, my God.",Jim
[excited] That's really irresponsible of Erin. She's a terrible babysitter.,Andy
I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.,Erin
"Okay, this was pretty simple-",Jim
Why are you here?,Pam
"[overlapping with Pam] Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.",Jim
"What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way.",Pam
"I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything.",Erin
"Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...",Jim
"Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?",Erin
You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.,Pam
"Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.",Erin
"No, we're good. Thank you, though.",Jim
"Okay. Alright, bye Cece.",Erin
Okay.,Pam
"Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again.",Jim
Not together!,Pam
[during curtain call for Sweeney Todd] Boo! Boo!,Michael
That was more horrifying than Nunsense.,Angela
All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.,Dwight
Where's my car? Come on.,Angela
"Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it's dried. I've already eaten, like, 30 apricots.",Michael
Darryl?,Sweeney Todd
Hey!,Darryl
Didn't know you were gonna be here. How's the toilet?,Sweeney Todd
"Silent. Look, congratulations.",Darryl
Thank you.,Sweeney Todd
I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!,Darryl
"Yeah, good job. Well done.",Michael
You're the guy who booed me.,Sweeney Todd
"Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn't one of em.",Michael
"No, I saw you, and you were the only one.",Sweeney Todd
"Get your eyes checked, chucklehead.",Michael
"Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work.",Creed
Thank you.,Sweeney Todd
You didn't have to boo him.,Darryl
"Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn't think it was indicative of how people were really feeling.",Michael
How would you like it if we booed you?,Darryl
That would never happen.,Michael
Boo! Boo!,Darryl
Okay. I appreciate the feedback.,Michael
Boo! Boo!,Darryl
I don't like that at all.,Michael
Are you ready?,Andy
"Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!",Erin
[pretends to slit her throat] Ah! Blood everywhere.,Andy
"Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work.",Erin
"Yeah, me, too.",Andy
"Okay, I kill you now.",Erin
Okay.,Andy
"All right, let's do this.",Dwight
"No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted.",Angela
"It's okay, I smell.",Dwight
"No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times.",Angela
"No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have sex.",Dwight
"Well, I won't tell if you don't.",Angela
"I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card]",Dwight
"Good night, Dwight.",Angela
Good night.,Dwight
"These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here.",Andy
"This is awesome. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup. [hangs up] Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise.",Erin
Awesome.,Andy
Okay.,Erin
See you later.,Andy
Thank you.,Erin
[attempting to move car seat] It's like The Hurt Locker!,Jim
This night was a disaster.,Pam
"No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.",Jim
Yeah?,Pam
We could put that in orange juice.,Jim
Get it.,Pam
Yeah?,Jim
Let's get our juice on.,Pam
Yeah!,Jim
Found him!,Phyllis
"Hey, what's going on here? Post-show blues?",Michael
"Yeah, I guess you could say that.",Andy
"Yeah, I get those every day after work.",Michael
"Your show was really great, Andy.",Phyllis
Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off.,Stanley
It was like amateur hour.,Andy
"It was an amateur production, technically.",Oscar
"Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome.",Michael
Stop just saying that.,Andy
"I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse.",Michael
Thank you. That feels good.,Andy
I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity.,Michael
"Andy, sing us another song.",Darryl
"Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now.",Andy
"Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.",Phyllis
"Come on, Andy, seriously.",Michael
Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy!,All
"Okay, all right, all right, all right.",Andy
[sings Macy Gray's 'I Try' and everyone joins in],Andy
"In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun! [imitates vacuum cleaner] I'm just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyone's tightening their belts in this economy. [humming theme music] Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasn't a victim, if you know what I'm talkin about.",Michael
Thanks you.,Shelby
"No, that was- I'm just getting into the first act.",Michael
"[driving past a line of Mexican men looking for work] Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! [man walks away] Que? QUE?",Dwight
[speaking Spanish],Mexican Man
We don't go with that man. I've seen several men go with that man and not come back.,Son
[speaking Spanish],Mexican Man
We've lost friends.,Son
[speaking Spanish],Mexican Man
We don't know what he does with them.,Son
[speaking Spanish],Mexican Man
I don't want to talk about it anymore.,Son
"I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada.",Dwight
Hola amigo.,Nate
"Hola, tu es une buena worker?",Dwight
"Si, yo muy bueno worker.",Nate
"Y el accento, donde are you from?",Dwight
"Scranton, y before that La Philadelphia.",Nate
You speak English?,Dwight
"Yes, I'm really good at English.",Nate
"Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.",Dwight
[quietly] Okay.,Nate
[nods to camera],Dwight
[seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who's this guy by our cars?,Angela
"That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about.",Dwight
"Yeah, I got stung up my dress.",Phyllis
Poor hornet.,Dwight
[looking outside through the window] I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets...,Dwight
But if he doesn't?,Ryan
He'll die.,Dwight
What?,Kelly
"Uhh, beg your pardon?",Andy
When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?,Dwight
[picks up blowtorch],Nate
Is that a blow torch?!,Kelly
No. No no no! [nos coming from all employees],Pam
Interesting choice...,Dwight
"[Nate starts walking away from hornet's nest, puts down the blowtorch] Yes!",Pam
Very very smart.,Andy
"Yeah, go away. [Kelly nodding]",Pam
"[picks up baseball bat, heads towards hornet's nest]",Nate
No! No no!,Employees except Dwight
A bat! Impressive...,Dwight
Oh it's stinging him! Ow! Ow! [yelling all around the office],Andy
"[walks into the office with a large, fake mustache on] Good morning Erin, any mustaches? I mean messages?",Michel
[giggles] Terrific!,Erin
There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work. [spinning in chair] He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves... other things as well.,Michael
[seeing a large red spot on Michael's lip] God! Wow!,Phyllis
"[shying away] Look, [sighs] It's a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.",Michael
That's no pimple Michael.,Phyllis
You mean cancer?,Michael
"What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.",Pam
It's just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.,Pam
"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore.",Meredith
It is?,Michael
"Yup, just a cold sore.",Meredith
"Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I don't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it.",Michael
I know how you got it. [smug expression on his face],Kevin
How?,Michael
Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.,Kevin
What?,Michael
"Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is.",Pam
I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is.,Meredith
I never seen herpes on you.,Kevin
"Because it's on my genitals, genius.",Meredith
You have a penis?,Kevin
"Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?",Andy
Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.,Michael
"That was like, ten years ago.",Jim
No! It was like four years ago!,Michael
"Michael, you're at least forty six!",Kevin
"Why at least? If you're guessing forty six just say forty six. [later in his office, places a band-aid over his cold sore]",Michael
Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?,Kelly
This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.,Angela
"You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.",Andy
I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.,Kelly
I don't even wanna know these things!,Oscar
"[walking in] Hey guys! [Angela leaves the table, exhales as she exits the room]",Meredith
"How did this happen, how did I get this?",Michael
"Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.",Dwight
"You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. [in pirate voice] It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port.",Michael
What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...,Dwight
Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.,Michael
You may have...,Dwight
Oh my God! What if I did?,Michael
"You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.",Dwight
Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.,Michael
"You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do.",Dwight
There's no way I'm gonna do that.,Michael
Then I will.,Dwight
[makes grunt in attempt to stop Dwight. Dwight hangs up],Michael
"No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.",Dwight
[on phone] Hello?,Donna
Hi Donna. It's Michael.,Michael
"Michael, I didn't think I'd here from you. How have you been?",Donna
"I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.",Michael
Oh no.,Donna
I can't even say it. H-I...,Michael
Oh my God.,Donna
...R-P-E-E-S,Michael
"Wait, you're calling to tell me that you have herpes?",Donna
"No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?",Michael
"Ummm, no.",Donna
Does your stupid husband have it?,Michael
No! He doesn't. Are you telling me I have to get tested?,Donna
Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!,Michael
So long Donna! [Michael hangs up],Dwight
"Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?",Andy
Not again...,Stanley
What do you mean again?,Andy
You're always asking for our attention.,Stanley
Maybe like a year ago...,Andy
Seems recent.,Stanley
"No, that's...",Andy
"Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.",Oscar
"Everyone, I've noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices.",Andy
"Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention.",Phyllis
"[agreement around the office] That's what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.",Stanley
It's the world's only international sport! [sits down],Andy
[on phone] This is Holly.,Holly
No this is Holly.,Michael
No this is Holly.,Holly
No this is Holly.,Michael
"No, this is Michael Scott.",Holly
Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.,Michael
"I am calling because, there's a terrible crash!",Holly
Oh really? Was anyone killed?,Michael
A lot of people.,Holly
Any nuns?,Michael
"Three nuns, [Michael laughs] from a Missionary in South Africa.",Holly
[Dwight looks confused to the camera] Were they in the missionary position? [Holly laughs],Michael
"[singing] Ba na na na na. Hot pizza, check it and see. Ba na na na. Got a whole bunch of pepperoni. Ba na na na na. [stops singing] Yeah, now you're looking at me. Anyone who's interested in entering into an honest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break.",Andy
[still on phone with Holly] Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn't been transferred?,Michael
Yeah.,Holly
"We would have twins. [Dwight points towards the corner of his lip, indicating Michael's 'herpes']",Michael
I don't think we'd have kids.,Holly
Mmhmm!,Michael
It was just for a few weeks!,Holly
Mhhmm! We would be married.,Michael
"[sternly] Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know.",Holly
Do what?,Michael
You romanticize things.,Holly
I don't romanticize th- [Dwight nodding and mouthing 'Yes you do'] No...,Michael
"Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up.",Holly
"He had no arms or legs, he couldn't hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation.",Michael
You made ourselves to be more than we were.,Holly
We were more than we were.,Michael
"I don't know what you're getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory.",Holly
"Ok, alright I gotta go.",Michael
Michael... [Michael hangs up],Holly
[to the camera] He forgot to mention the herpes.,Dwight
It didn't come up organically.,Michael
"[to a client] ...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. [Seeing Michael and Dwight] Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. [to client again] The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to...",Jan
"How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I'd tell you.",Jan
It's nice to see you doing so well.,Michael
"Yeah I'm really happy. Me and Astrid against the world. [laughs] We're loving it, yeah. I'm kind of a supermom.",Jan
Bringing home the bacon.,Michael
Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... [laughs] I love that commercial.,Jan
I don't understand the reference.,Dwight
"Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.",Jan
"We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you. [Michael shushes him]",Dwight
Are you gonna keep me in suspense? [Michael sighs],Jan
"[after long wait, to Dwight] Would you excuse us...",Michael
"Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it.",Dwight
He hasn't changed.,Michael
"No, so what couldn't wait?",Jan
Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?,Michael
"Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.",Jan
What?,Michael
"You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I'm in.",Jan
"So, guys. I've been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office we're better than that. Ok, now I'm going to show you a picture of genitalia. [grossed our remarks from around the office as Andy holds p a picture of a nude man]",Andy
Andy...,Erin
"What, is it because he's black?",Andy
"Nope, it's because it's genitalia.",Jim
Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I'm going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia. [Kevin is grossed out immediately. The office is grossed out],Andy
Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?,Jim
"It's normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? It's just as normal as anyone else's.",Andy
No! In the beginning we were not good.,Jan
"Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!",Michael
Well if there's anything exciting about it it's because we both knew it was wrong!,Jan
Because we work together.,Michael
"No, ok. Imagine there's a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!",Jan
Am I the princess?,Michael
"No I'm the princess, and the queen.",Jan
"[sighs] Ok, so I'm the guy at the station.",Michael
Mommy!,Astrid
Assy! Awwhhh how was school?,Jan
It was cool.,Astrid
[singing] What did you learn?,Jan
What did I learn?,Astrid
"You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we're all, sisters and brothers.",Jan
I have herpes.,Michael
I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong...,Michael
"Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences?",Andy
It feels unbelievable!,Kevin
[writing on board] Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels...,Andy
...unbelievable.,Kevin
The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.,Phyllis
"Express love, magical.",Andy
It feels amazing!,Kevin
"Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?",Andy
Yes.,Kevin
Then I will write it down.,Andy
The feeling of pure risk.,Creed
"I actually had that down in the cons column, but...",Andy
It's thrilling.,Creed
"Ok, umm. I'll move that. Thrill of risk.",Andy
"Andy, aren't there also negatives to sex?",Erin
Yes! Thank you! Such as?,Andy
Unplanned pregnancy.,Erin
"Yes, unplanned pregnancy.",Andy
"Like Jim and Pam, say whaaat?",Kelly
Just admit that your baby was a mistake.,Kevin
Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.,Pam
Good!,Jim
"I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros.",Darryl
Thank you!,Jim and Pam
"Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.",Andy
"Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you.",Dwight
"You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She...",Michael
Jan knows paper.,Dwight
"No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.",Michael
"Wait, what Holly said?",Dwight
"Yes, I don't...",Michael
Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.,Dwight
"I know, I know.",Michael
"Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.",Dwight
Got it.,Michael
"TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!",Dwight
I'M TRYING! GOD!,Michael
[walks into park with Dwight] Hi stranger! Long time!,Michael
Who are you?,Old Woman

I don't think so...,Old Woman

"Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?",Michael
Come on old lady. Let's go.,Dwight
What is happening? [Dwight shushes her],Old Woman
Come on.,Dwight
Who can tell me what the safest form of sex is?,Andy
Condoms.,Darryl
"Incorrect, the only true form of safe sex, ok? Abstinence.",Andy
Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski! [office laughs],Darryl
I just thought I'd bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That's all. Anybody?,Andy
Andy that's way too personal of a question.,Pam
"Well someone could answer if they want to. [looks at Erin hopefully] Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on... using this pencil. [Stanley laughs]",Andy
What?,Andy
Why would you choose a pencil Andy?,Oscar
"Well I'm not gonna use my penis, Oscar! It's not exactly hard right now anyway.",Andy
"Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.",Meredith
I'm doing this for you Meredith!,Andy
I didn't want you it!,Meredith
Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now?! [throws pizza box at painting and leaves],Andy
It'll go away in time just don't touch it.,Helene
Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?,Michael
What did you think we were?,Helene
"Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you...",Michael
"I think for you to have come here even expecting that we can have a conversation like this show's ho-how self deluded you are! Michael, your memory has failed you greatly.",Helene
Jerk. [walks off],Michael
Michael! [attempting to get out of the car on the side in which Michael parked too close to a bush. Michael ignores him and walks into a building.],Dwight
"So this is the chef's kitchen, which makes it perfect for real entertainers.",Carroll
"Real entertainers, like Billy Joel.",Michael
Michael.,Carroll
"Carroll, how are you?",Michael
I'm great! How are you?,Carroll
"I'm great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I'm going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.",Michael
You didn't call my office and ask where I was?,Carroll
No.,Michael
Because the receptionist told me a man called but he only said he was my ex-lover.,Carroll
Weird...,Michael
Yeah.,Carroll
He sounds like a nice guy.,Michael
"I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.",Andy
This wasn't really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up.,Gabe
How is that relevant to anything?,Andy
"I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, 'My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.' I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.",Gabe
The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.,Andy
"I'll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you.",Gabe
Oh wow another living room!,Michael
It's a family room.,Carroll
"You put the TV here, you put the family over here.",Michael
Michael why are you here?,Carroll
Someone told me that I romanticize relationships,Michael
"You know, we all do that.",Carroll
I have herpes.,Michael
What? Did you have that while we were together?,Carroll
"I just found out today. It's, uh, right there.",Michael
"Oh! Oh, that's what you're talking about?",Carroll
"Mmhmm, I'm sorry.",Michael
Did the doctor check it out?,Carroll
I'm between specialists right now.,Michael
"Yes, yes Michael. Actually you do make a bigger deal out of things than you need to. You proposed to me on our fourth date.",Carroll
Well I believe in love at first sight.,Michael
"Well so do I, but we didn't love each other at first either. I don't know what you were thinking!",Carrol
"I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.",Michael
"[walking downstairs] Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?",Dwight
No.,Carroll
"[Andy walks in Darryl's office] We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?",Darryl
No I'm just sweating.,Andy
I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.,Darryl
I'm not crying I'm just sweating.,Andy
"Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self.",Darryl
Ok.,Andy
Yeah.,Darryl
"I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?",Darryl
"[on answering machine] This is Holly Flax, I can't come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up. [BEEP]",Holly
"Hi Holly it's Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It's just. You know? It's weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok. Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.",Michael
What is this about?,Oscar
"Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?",Michael
Yes!,Oscar
You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.,Michael
What?,Oscar
Herpes duplex.,Michael
It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.,Dwight
I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.,Michael
We were never lovers!,Oscar
"I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had sex with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms...",Dwight
"Flower shops, fireworks celebrations...",Michael
Fence with a hole in it..,Dwight
"Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park...",Michael
"The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home.",Dwight
An electric car dealership. [Oscar gets up and starts leaving],Michael
"The democratic primaries,",Dwight
Oscar! Think abou- Think! [door slams],Michael
Look at that.,Michael
Huh?,Oscar
Nice!,Michael
"I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning.",Oscar
Okay.,Pam
She is a beaut!,Michael
Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.,Dwight
"Yes, it is.",Oscar
"Oh, look at that. [pushing bike] Smooth roll.",Michael
Yeah.,Oscar
You got it! Lance Armstrong's Bike!,Kevin
Yes.,Oscar
His ass was on that seat? All right!,Meredith
Nice.,Kevin
"No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.",Oscar
"I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.",Kelly
[crashing sound] Michael!,Pam
"Oh, god!",Michael
Oh...,Oscar
"Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike.",Michael
Are you sure you once knew how to do this?,Jim
"I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back...that support you. [Pam and Jim begin wheeling him] Mi-chael! Mi-chael!",Michael
[chanting] Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael!,All
Yeah!,Dwight
"Come on, Michael! Yeah!",Pam
Just steer more now.,Jim
"[crashes into Jim and Pam's parked car] Oh, my god!",Michael
Not the car!,Pam
No! No!,Jim
"Ow! [grunts, stumbles to his feet] You never forget. Whoo!",Michael
How do I look?,Dwight
Amazing. How do I look?,Jim
Normal. Ugly.,Dwight
"Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go.",Jim
"Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after.",Dwight
"We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.",Dwight
He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.,Jim
Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.,Dwight
I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining.,Jim
And who is this 'the' Steve Nash?,Dwight
Phoenix Sun's point guard?,Jim
No.,Dwight
No? Nothin'?,Jim
"No, Mr. Jock Hipster.",Dwight
"Well, I'm neither of those things, so...",Jim
"[reading Cornell magazine] Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big Red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh, says here Dan Becker fell off the side of Kilimanjaro in a climbing accident. It appears Dan's Sherpa survived to tell the tale-Oh, my God!",Andy
What? Is Dan okay?,Phyllis
"No, he died. It's Broccoli Rob. You know this guy; I showed you his picture on Facebook.",Andy
Yes.,Phyllis
"Some Vermont-based alums can hear 'Broccoli' Rob Blatt, '96, in the state milk lobby's new milk awareness song, 'Calci-YUM!', featuring Phish's Trey Anastasio. Says Broccoli, 'Trey and I had a ton of fun in the studio, and I think you can hear it in the song.''",Andy
"Oh, that's great news for your friend.",Phyllis
"Yeah, yeah, it's great...",Andy
"You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.",Phyllis
"I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh.",Andy
Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.,Dwight
"Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight...[motions to lobby]",Jim
Crap.,Dwight
Danny Cordray is the worst.,Dwight
"Well, by worst, you mean the best.",Jim
"The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.",Dwight
"So, the situation is the worst.",Jim
"Also, he slept with Pam.",Dwight
"No, he didn't. [Dwight mouthing 'yes, he did']",Jim
Tell 'em.,Jim
Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.,Pam
What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.,Jim
"That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.",Pam
"Yeah, I thought you started it.",Jim
"No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right?",Pam
Ahhh.,Jim
I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay?,Dwight
"Okay, great-",Jim
Watch this.,Dwight
-I'm just gonna watch.,Jim
"[speaking loudly] So anyway, she says, 'that is the biggest penis I have ever seen.' And I said, 'I know. That's why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars.' Well, hello Danny!",Dwight
"Hey, Dwight. Good to see you. Jim, hey.",Danny
[shaking hands] How are ya?,Jim
Good to see you too.,Danny
What are you doing?,Dwight
"Oh, I'm just here for the coffee.",Danny
Like hell you are.,Dwight
Dwight!,Jim
"He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!",Dwight
"Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea-[cell phone rings] Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello?",Michael
"Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?",Jim
"Oh, hey. No, I'm not busy. What's up?",Michael
What?,Angela
You are busy! We're in a meeting!,Oscar
"It's Jim, Okay? Yes.",Michael
"Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.",Jim
"You need the big guns, yes?",Michael
Yes.,Jim
What'd he say? What did he say?,Dwight
The big gun thing. [Dwight grabs at phone] Stop!,Jim
"I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight. [hangs up] Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.",Michael
"You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.",Pam
"[laughing] No, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me?",Michael
You don't?,Pam
No! Okay. [runs out the door] All right.,Michael
"[knocking] Knockity-knock, don't knock back. Just kidding you can knock; it's your office. Do you have a minute?",Andy
I'm very busy with time-sensitive work.,Darryl
"Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, but I can tell by the reflection in your glasses that you're entering points into Weight Watchers dot com.",Andy
"If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What?",Darryl
I'm starting a band and I need you on keyboards.,Andy
Nah. I play for pleasure.,Darryl
This is for pleasure.,Andy
I wouldn't enjoy that.,Darryl
I'm willing to pay you.,Andy
"Oh, yeah?",Darryl
Yeah.,Andy
How much?,Darryl
Sixty bucks a session.,Andy
That's crazy money. I'll take forty.,Darryl
Yes!,Andy
There he is.,Dwight
"Oh, no, that's a male model.",Michael
"No, that's him.",Jim
"That...hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company.",Michael
"Danny Cordray, Osprey Paper.",Danny
Nice to meet you.,Michael
Three of you guys for one sale.,Danny
"Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?",Michael
"Well, whatever works for ya. Anyway. All right.",Danny
All right.,Michael
It's good to see you guys. Nice to meet you.,Danny
Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.,Michael
He's ready for you.,Receptionist
"Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime. Ready, one, two--",Michael
"Nope, not doing that.",Jim
I've been in showtime mode since breakfast.,Dwight
"Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.",Michael
Showtime!,Jim
It's showtime! Oh...never mind. Let's go.,Michael
"When I knock on your door, you know who it is; it's Michael Scott. We've been together forever and we-",Michael
"Michael, I appreciate everything that Dunder-Mifflin has done for this company.",Steve
"You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. We're going to deliver to you on weekends.",Michael
"That's very generous, but-",Steve
"And you know what else we're gonna do? I can't believe I'm gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you'd better shake my hand right now.",Michael
He's not kidding.,Dwight
"Shake it, shake it!",Michael
"Michael, I'm going with Danny.",Steve
Oh.,Dwight
Thanks for coming in.,Steve
Okay. Thank you.,Michael
Thank you.,Steve
"Thanks, Steve.",Michael
Jim talked too much.,Dwight
"No, I didn't.",Jim
"Yes, you did.",Dwight
"Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested. [pounds the elevator button] Why is there a door close button if it doesn't even close the door?",Michael
"How do I feel about losing the sale? It's like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned.",Michael
"You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They're a small company. They're smaller than we are. What's our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him?",Michael
We sell better?,Stanley
"Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave?",Michael
I would like to stay. This pertains to me.,Stanley
"Why don't you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?",Michael
Why do you always assume I have diabetes?,Stanley
"I don't know, your frame, your build-why don't you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you're not a diabetic. [Stanley stands to leave] See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?",Michael
I could try to seduce him.,Phyllis
"Oh, my god!",Michael
I know how we can learn his tricks.,Dwight
What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.,Dwight
Is that your office?,Jim
"Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.",Dwight
Uh...,Phyllis
I'm outta here.,Stanley
This is weird.,Phyllis
You know what this is? This is a stinger.,Michael
A what?,Jim
Like the movie.,Michael
I think you mean The Sting.,Jim
"Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers.",Michael
Nope. Different movie.,Jim
The Sting. The Sting.,Dwight
Your two o'clock. [Danny enters],Erin
"Thanks, hun.",Meredith
Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.,Jim
Danny Cordray. It's great to meet you.,Danny
Meredith Van Helsing. Pleased to meet you.,Meredith
Meredith Van Helsing?,Jim
Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.,Dwight
Okay. But what is he more famous for?,Jim
Shhh! Hey! That's my mug.,Michael
"You know this isn't real TV, right?",Jim
Yes.,Michael
"[singing] Please Mr. President, if you wanna give hope a whirl, bring our troops home safe and sound, says this little girl.",Darryl and Andy
[in falsetto] Please Mr. President-,Andy
"One second, one second, one second. [stops playing] So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?",Darryl
Yeah.,Andy
But you're singing it.,Darryl
"Yeah, but I'm using my falsetto.",Andy
"No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song.",Darryl
"Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul.",Andy
"Oh, I never sing with soul.",Darryl
That's a lie.,Andy
I could sing it.,Kevin
I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.,Andy
But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.,Kevin
"Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four-",Andy
"I'm gonna take off my coat, if you don't mind. It's a bit warm in here.",Danny
Hel-lo!,Meredith
"Oh, no, no. No. Don't-",Michael
"People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.",Dwight
Testify.,Michael
"Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-",Jim
"Yeah, he is that good-looking.",Michael
"He's very, very handsome.",Dwight
Okay.,Michael
That's a great set of shoulder's you got there. What is that...Genetics? Creatine? [phone rings] Sorry. Yeah?,Meredith
"Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin' at him.",Michael
I'm sorry. [hangs up] You're here to sell me some paper.,Meredith
"Well, actually, uh... no, Miss Van Helsing, that's not why I'm here. I'm here to meet you, see if we'd be a, you know, good fit.",Danny
What do you mean?,Meredith
Oh...my god! He's making her sell to him.,Michael
[everyone finishes listening to song] Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar?,Andy
It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.,Oscar
But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?,Andy
Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.,Pam
"I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics.",Andy
I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.,Ryan
Rude. And not helpful.,Andy
"Well, I really, really, really liked it.",Creed
"Well, that...really bums me out.",Andy
You're welcome.,Creed
"We should think of this as a first date. And I think it's going very well, how 'bout you?",Danny
Real well. Uh...feels more like a third date to me.,Meredith
"Ha ha, okay, there you go! [phone rings, Meredith answers]",Danny
Stay-,Michael
"Shut up and let me do this! [hangs up] You know, what is with this desk keeping us so far apart?",Meredith
"I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh?",Danny
Oh...,Dwight
"Well, we'll get this...[Meredith unbuttons]",Danny
Oh!,Michael
"Oh, man!",Dwight
"So, what's your drink? You a vodka man? Me too.",Meredith
We gotta get someone else in there right now.,Jim
You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-,Jim
That sounds fake.,Oscar
What do you mean?,Jim
"I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-",Dwight
"Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?",Jim
Okay.,Oscar
So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.,Jim
All right. I can do that. Then what?,Oscar
Then make him pitch to you.,Dwight
Yes.,Jim
We gotta see what he's got.,Dwight
Exactly. You can do this.,Jim
"Okay, and remember-you're not gay.",Dwight
Stop it! It's gonna be great.,Jim
Okay.,Oscar
"And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.",Jim
"Meredith, I-",Oscar
"Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn't speak any English.",Meredith
Hola. Que tal?,Danny
"Como estas, senor?",Oscar
"Uh, Manuel, cleano el window.",Meredith
Who else we got?,Jim
Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.,Dwight
Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-,Ryan
Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.,Jim
Don't let us down.,Michael
[points to Jim] Will do. [points to Michael] Won't do.,Ryan
"Yeah, sure.",Danny
"You smell like a Scorpio. [Ryan enters] This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesn't speak English either. Esteban, el flooro.",Meredith
"You know what? I may have parked my car in a compact space, and I hate when I see others do that, so-",Danny
"Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I'm-",Meredith
"No, no, no....",Michael
"No, no, no, no...",Jim
I'm goin 'in!,Michael
"Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!",Dwight
"Stop, stop! Oh, my god! [enters office] Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.",Michael
Michael Scott.,Danny
"I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-",Michael
Please to meet you-,Meredith
"Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.",Michael
Hmm.,Danny
"I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.",Michael
But from where?,Danny
A surveillance room next to this one.,Michael
"Okay, so you...set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?",Danny
Yes. And it's the sincerest form of flattery.,Michael
Or...crazy.,Danny
Well-,Michael
I'm gonna go.,Danny
"Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.",Michael
No!,Dwight
"No, no, no, no.",Jim
"Oh, well then, yeah. All right. Hey! [knocking on wall] Good luck, guys. Seems like you got a great operation here.",Danny
"No, we don't. Here's-here's my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.",Michael
"What do you mean, my tricks? There's no tricks, man. I'm just a good salesman. You wanna copy that? You can't copy that! [opens door to leave]",Danny
"You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop. [closes door] You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me.",Michael
"Sure. You seem like a fun, professional guy.",Danny
"So, you will?",Michael
[opening door again to leave] No!,Danny
"Hold it, hold it. [forcing door closed] Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?",Michael
Get out of my way.,Danny
"Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?",Michael
"I swear to God, I'm gonna hit you. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I'm not-it's just I'm very upset right now.",Danny
"I know, I know.",Michael
I'm very upset!,Danny
"Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?",Michael
More freedom.,Danny
"I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?",Michael
"Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!",Michael
[bleep] me!,Kelly
"O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?",Michael
Josh Duhamel.,Kelly
"Yeah, I can see that.",Angela
No. No. No. Somebody in this office.,Michael
He's like a better-looking Andy.,Kevin
"Thanks, Kevin.",Andy
"No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me.",Michael
"It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.",Oscar
Michael?,Dwight
Yes.,Michael
Can I talk to you about something?,Dwight
"No, you may not.",Michael
It's about this very announcement you just made.,Dwight
I said no.,Michael
Michael-,Dwight
We're not-,Michael
"Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.",Jim
"Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave. [pointing to Danny] Don't leave. Don't let him.",Michael
Gotcha. [they go into Michael's office],Erin
You hired him?,Jim
"Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?",Michael
Stay the same.,All
"Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better.",Michael
It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.,Phyllis
"No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us.",Michael
Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.,Dwight
"He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.",Michael
Hmpf!,Stanley
Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.,Dwight
Good-bye!,Michael
Song's about truth.,Darryl
Yeah.,Kevin
What's something you really care about?,Darryl
Reverse snobbery.,Andy
More universal.,Darryl
Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by.,Andy
[plays soft chords and sings] Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.,Darryl
"Oh, nice!",Kevin
Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-that's amazing!,Andy
Go ahead.,Darryl
[singing] Which me am I gonna be today?,Andy
Which me am I gonna be today?,Darryl
I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?,Andy
Or the me that stinks.,Kevin
"Oh, my gosh! We're almost out of time. How much for another half hour?",Andy
"Oh, don't worry about it.",Darryl
Wait. Seriously?,Andy
Yeah.,Darryl
"So we're just, like, jamming as friends?",Andy
"One, two, three, hit it.",Darryl
Closet full of mes-,Andy
"Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates.",Danny
Did ya?,Jim
"Yeah. Way ,way, way back.",Danny
I'm just kidding. She told me about it.,Jim
Oh. She was not into me.,Danny
Oh.,Jim
Obviously. I don't even think she called me back.,Danny
You snubbed her.,Dwight
"Dwight, please.",Jim
"Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too 'meh' or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup? [Pam mouthing 'I wear makeup'] We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!",Dwight
Okay...that's different.,Danny
"Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. [awkward pause] So...you're gonna be workin' here?",Dwight
Uh...I mean-yeah.,Danny
Welcome aboard.,Dwight
Thank you.,Danny
"Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine?",Jim
"It's after 5:00, Jim. I'm not gonna take this home. [shakes Danny's hand]",Dwight
Oh.,Danny
Pleasure.,Dwight
Thanks.,Danny
"This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don't even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer.",Michael
"[singing and playing drums] Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?",Kevin
"Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love. Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love and I gave her the croak that meant I love you.",All
I'll be your croak monsieur.,Darryl
[falsetto] I'll be your croak madame.,Andy
"Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.",Kevin
I find you absolutely ribbiting!,Darryl
"Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.",All
"Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.",Andy
Croak!,Kevin
Ribbit!,Andy
Scoopity-splash!,Darryl
Nice.,Kevin
"What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now.",Andy
"I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours.",Jim
"Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?",Jim
What's a seven letter word for purse?,Stanley
"[sitting at Phyllis' desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!",Kevin
Nope. Starts with an H.,Stanley
"[shirtless, wearing only a tie] Handbag.",Andy
Hmmm. [glances at Andy] Thank you.,Stanley
Shh! Shhh! [watches Jim put a cardboard box over Stanley's monitor],Andy
"[standing outside the conference room, wearing fake teeth, watching Stanley walk in] All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!",Michael
Yay! [applause],All
"[looks at the clock, then at his watch] Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o'clock, I will see you all tomorrow:",Stanley
"[turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves]",Pam
"[standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley!",Dwight
"Night, everybody.",Stanley
"So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?",Oscar
"The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.",Kevin
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?",Erin
"A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year! [puts head down over fake bomb made from cardboard, high pitched voice] Six seconds, MacGruber! [lifts head] Pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned! [puts head down, high pitched voice] Uh, two seconds MacGruber! [lifts head] Including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board... OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION! [throws fake bomb, takes off sunglasses, points to camera] MACGRUBERRRR!",Michael
"People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!",Pam
Stop.,Jim
"[has his hands around Jim's neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.",Dwight
Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.,Jim
To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler. [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.,Dwight
What?,Pam
You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.,Dwight
"I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on.",Pam
[places pipe in mouth] I am Popeye!,Jim
"I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no.",Jim
"[dressed as Lady Gaga] In case you can't read m-m-my Poker Face... [laughs] we will be reviewing our sales policies. [accepts note from Michael, reads it out loud] I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up.",Gabe
MACGRUBER!,Michael
Lame. Why don't witches wear panties?,Todd Packer
"Oh, here we go!",Michael
Because they need to grip the broom!,Todd Packer
[laughs] OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?,Michael
Lake Erie.,Dwight
"When our warehouse workers make deliveries, they're going to be encouraged to offer clients extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales.",Gabe
"So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?",Michael
That is correct.,Gabe
Has anyone started calling you 'Gabe-wad' yet?,Todd Packer
Not here.,Gabe
Gabe-wad.,Danny
"Okay, guys, fun is fun, but-",Gabe
Blackula!,Michael
Dracula.,Darryl
"Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.",Michael
Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.,Darryl
"Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.",Michael
I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.,Darryl
Really? We're good?,Michael
Yeah. We're cool.,Darryl
Okay. [reaches out and shakes Darryl's hand] Okay.,Michael
What's under your shirt?,Darryl
Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.,Michael
Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing.,Michael
"[leans hobo sack against the refrigerator] It's a great stick, right?",Toby
It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.,Ryan
Thanks!,Toby
"Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?",Oscar
No.,Toby
No.,Ryan
I get that. I get that.,Kelly
"Excuse me, everybody. I want to invite you all to the Halloween party I'm having at my bar.",Danny
You own a bar?,Kevin
"Public School, at exit 11.",Danny
That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!,Oscar
So. You're all on the list!,Danny
"Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.",Ryan
"Hey, what's the crowd like, Danny? Our age?",Creed
Okay.,Danny
I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.,Kevin
"I don't know, they're both handsome.",Phyllis
Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?,Dwight
I think he-,Phyllis
"Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam.",Creed
"So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.",Jim
We were basically Romeo and Juliet.,Pam
That's right.,Jim
Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.,Pam
Yikes.,Jim
But I've learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim's shoulder] He's a cartoon sailor.,Pam
"Oh, no.",Jim
And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?,Pam
"No. No, I'm not gonna-no.",Jim
Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?,Andy
I don't care.,Jim
I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.,Kevin
You know what else? [pulling fake teeth out of his mouth] The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. [puts teeth back in],Andy
"Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe.",Kevin
[removes teeth] Creed's going?!,Andy
Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.,Jim
Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?,Michael
[answers phone] Hello?,Darryl
"Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.",Michael
I'm good.,Darryl
"You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!",Michael
"This is embarrassing, Michael.",Darryl
"Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.",Michael
"Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]",Darryl
"[leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.",Pam
This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.,Michael
"So, what happened?",Angela
"I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now...",Michael
Oh! [fumbles for phone],Erin
And we are going to straighten this out.,Michael
Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.,Andy
Mmhm!,Michael
"Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so... no need to [mimicking Andy] screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let's give Darryl a round of applause, as planned. [claps]",Gabe
I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now.,Michael
He went to Gabe behind your back.,Dwight
"No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.",Michael
He went over your head to go behind your back.,Dwight
What is taking someone from behind?,Michael
"No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.",Dwight
"It was a good idea, though.",Michael
Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.,Dwight
"Hey, Danny.",Andy
Hey.,Danny
"I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight.",Andy
I was looking forward to throwing some darts with you guys.,Danny
You were?,Andy
"Okay, well then, uh, I mean, maybe we could do it like... next Halloween.",Kevin
For sure.,Danny
"We're just like, totally caught in the middle here.",Andy
What are you talking about?,Danny
Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go...,Andy
Jim and Pam really don't want you to go?,Danny
They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.,Kevin
I'll talk to them.,Danny
"Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you.",Kevin
Okay.,Danny
Or you're dead.,Kevin
Okay.,Danny
Okay.,Kevin
Kelly! Great costume!,Erin
Oh.,Toby
"KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out.",Angela
"Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.",Kelly
Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.,Oscar
"Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar.",Kelly
"Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?",Angela
"This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.",Angela
"Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!",Dwight
[staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about?,Michael
"Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.",Dwight
"Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't-[sees Kevin and Gabe fist-bump] Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?",Michael
I am so sorry.,Kevin
"Oh, you're sorry?",Michael
I just thought-,Kevin
What did you just thought?,Michael
"Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry]",Kevin
All right.,Michael
I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.,Kevin
Okay.,Michael
Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.,Kevin
"Well, don't let it happen again.",Michael
[hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.,Kevin
I-,Michael
"[bleep] you, Gabe!",Kevin
Okay...,Gabe
Can you imagine? It's just crazy.,Danny
That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.,Jim
"Look, I'm just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history.",Danny
"Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.",Pam
Exactly.,Danny
It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?,Jim
No! Two or three dates.,Danny
It was two.,Pam
Was it two? I thought it was three.,Danny
"No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so...",Pam
Oooh! You can't handle the truth! [laughs],Jim
"[laughing] Well, that does not sound like me.",Danny
"Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that's what happened.",Pam
"[stops laughing] Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren't weird.",Danny
Hmm-mm.,Pam
"Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.",Michael
I'm not mad. Are you mad?,Darryl
You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.,Michael
"Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.",Darryl
"Okay, that might help. If you said 'I'm sorry' in front of everybody.",Michael
Mike.,Darryl
In front of me.,Michael
You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.,Darryl
So that's it.,Michael
That's it.,Darryl
Is it?,Michael
Yes.,Darryl
"Sookehhh. [removes teeth] Bill Compton, from True Blood.",Andy
How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?,Stanley
I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.,Oscar
Oh.,Phyllis
Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.,Oscar
"Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.",Ryan
"Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.",Pam
Pam. Can you vote for other people?,Kevin
"Yeah, I gotta get in on this. [mocking Darryl] Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!",Michael
Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.,Michael
"Michael, this is a bad idea.",Pam
What's a bad idea?,Michael
"Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?",Pam
"NEVER! [tosses wig] Okay, you know what? Fine. I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl.",Michael
Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?,Kelly
[walking down the runway] Raaah! [waves sword],Stanley
"I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.",Oscar
Angela as the nurse!,Pam
"I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.",Angela
What should we ask?,Phyllis
"Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?",Michael
We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?,Jim
He says no.,Erin
Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.,Michael
No.,Darryl
"Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?",Michael
Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.,Dwight
"I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.",Dwight
If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?,Michael
[hands are being forced to the letters] A... S... S... H... E... T?,Erin
An asset!,Phyllis
"Ah! [lets go, candy corn flies everywhere] That's enough.",Erin
I don't think it's gonna work out the way you think.,Danny
I don't think you get it.,Todd Packer
Hey.,Danny
Hey.,Jim
"This is some party, huh?",Danny
"When you work hard, you play hard around here. Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?",Jim
Are you serious?,Danny
"Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...",Jim
"You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and...",Danny
Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.,Jim
"Halpert, you lookin' for someone to bang your wife?",Todd Packer
Nope.,Jim
Okay. You wanna know? I didn't call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.,Danny
Fifty seven. Fifty eight.,Ryan
"Wait, wait. She hasn't moved in awhile.",Meredith
[reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!,Oscar
Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.,Erin
I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.,Pam
Just tell her the real reason.,Jim
Do you honestly want to know why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago?,Danny
Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.,Jim
"I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like 'gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why.'",Pam
Okay. Honestly. I didn't call you back because I-thought you seemed a little... dorky.,Danny
"Hey, man.",Jim
"Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.",Pam
"In the future, you need to get Michael's approval on anything before coming to me.",Gabe
Thank you.,Michael
You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.,Darryl
"Okay, well, obviously if it's a really, really good idea, my door is open.",Gabe
"If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!",Michael
You said no to this one!,Darryl
"That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?",Michael
What have you done for me?,Darryl
Oh...,Michael
What have you done for me?,Darryl
Well...,Michael
Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.,Darryl
"Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? [explosion noise] This really make you think, Michael?",Gabe
"Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.",Michael
Yeah.,Gabe
"You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.",Michael
I don't understand the point of a hat.,Darryl
"You're right, we don't need a hat.",Gabe
I am not budging on the hat issue.,Michael
"Okay. We're going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period.",Gabe
Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.,Michael
"Okay, why don't we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo.",Gabe
"Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.",Michael
Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.,Darryl
Sorry I was a jerk.,Michael
Friends fight. Friends fight.,Michael
"What's up, man?",Andy
"Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?",Darryl
"When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day. Bernard's Regards.",Andy
This was your freshman year.,Darryl
"I started to ask myself, 'Do I have big plans here?' I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group? Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School.",Andy
No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.,Darryl
"To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?",Jim
"Oh, wow!",Pam
[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound],Jim
"Aww, my hero!",Pam
"Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez.",Pam
"If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me.",Kelly
Shake things up. I'm a Nader guy.,Ryan
"Best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen. Like, freaky good.",Creed
"I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.",Pam
I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.,Kelly
"That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what-",Michael
Stop.,Jim
"[under his breath] Um... kay. Uh, alright.",Michael
One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.,Pam
Di-Did you say vampire?,Erin
"Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]",Pam
Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.,Dwight
"Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick.",Pam
[rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh...,Dwight
"And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.",Pam
"NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.",Dwight
Elaborate.,Jim
"The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...",Dwight
I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.,Pam
Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.,Dwight
"So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.",Jim
Yes. I would welcome it.,Dwight
"[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.",Jim
"The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.",Dwight
"Jim. Pam. [gasps, speaks in baby voice] And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything. [back to her normal voice] I wish you both a pleasant day. [baby voice] And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.",Angela
Cece's getting christened today.,Pam
Big day.,Jim
Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that.,Pam

"Oh, yes. [mimicking smoking] Doobie-doobie doo.",Michael
"I invited everyone in the office because it's not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate... my joy. And our, all of ours joys.",Michael
"[looking at Cece, under his breath] Ah, man. [looks at Erin talking to Gabe]",Andy
"Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.",Andy

"Oh, Michael, this is just for family.",Pam
But I'm the Godfather.,Michael
"It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.",Jim
Are you talking to me?,Michael
"[whispers to Pam] Ok, your turn.",Jim
Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.,Michael
"Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather.",Pam
Yeah.,Michael
"I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry.",Pam
[normal voice] I'm not the godfather.,Michael
"Okay, thank you.",Pam
[clears his throat] So who is the godfather?,Michael
"Our friend, Seth, and his wife there.",Pam
"Okay. Old friend, like, you've known him since kindergarten?",Michael
"No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later.",Pam
"No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.",Michael
"Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.",Pam
"I don't even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that's not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.",Michael

Good morning.,Pastor
Good morning.,All
Good morning.,Michael
"What a terrific day this is, and not just because the Eagles are playing. [laughter, Kevin giggles]",Pastor
"You may have seen the bus out front. Today we also say good-bye to our young adult ministry. They're leaving for three months to build a school for the village of Quimixto, in Cabo Corrientes, Mexico.",Pastor
"I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.",Ryan

And thank you for your prayers for Justin. We hope for a speedy recovery.,Female church member
"Thank you. Anyone else with a prayer or a remembrance? [Dwight and an eldery man stand up at the same time, Dwight stares at him, man sits back down]",Pastor
"Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.",Dwight
"Christening calls to repentance, to faithfulness, and to discipleship. We've come to celebrate these babies.",Pastor

Right now?,Jim
"Well, she can't bring this up with her.",Pam
"Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip.",Jim
"[whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!",Jim
[seeing Jim come in with Cece wearing an old t-shirt] What?,Pam
What?,Jim
"Honey, no.",Pam
Yes.,Jim
"No, no.",Pam
This is happening.,Jim
We have an extra outfit in the bag.,Pam
No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.,Jim
You said you checked it.,Pam
I did... say that.,Jim
"At this time, will the families please come join me?",Pastor
"Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, the paper industry's not gonna last forever.",Michael
"Before we go, I'd like to remind everyone that the 'Halberts' have been kind enough to host a reception next door immediately following the service.",Pastor
Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.,Jim
"Okay, 'A,' Halbert. And, 'B,' I think a more appropriate statement would be, 'The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.'",Jim

We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people.,Pam
You don't know them all?,Angela
"Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all.",Pam
Jesus is not your caterer. [baby voice to Cece] But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? [normal voice] They don't think.,Angela
[to Cece] Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you.,Pam
"Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?",Jim
I don't know. I'm just hungry.,Pam
"Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. [Pam looks at Jim] Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.",Jim

"With what? How? Sometimes, Michael. Sometimes.",Kevin

I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are.,Stanley
Shh.,Michael
"Right now, Jessica's children have to walk twelve miles to a school with dirt floors.",Girl
No.,Michael

"[overhearing Dwight's conversation] Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.",Michael
I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.,Dwight
Are you kidding me? Stop it.,Michael
I'll call you back.,Dwight
"My parents explained it to me this way. You wouldn't hesitate to save a family member from a burning building, but what if the earth was your building and all the people on it were your family?",Girl
What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?,Andy
Shh.,Michael
Thank you. Or should I say gracias?,Girl
[sighs] Cece went down.,Pam
[holding up an empty serving dish] What was this? You're out of it.,Woman

"Is it just the one jug of apple cider? [Pam shrugs, woman walks away]",Woman
Who the heck was that?,Pam
"I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.",Jim
We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas.,Pam
All right. And cider.,Jim
[pointing to group of young adults laughing] Look at that. Look at that. That's fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let's go help Africa. Let's go build an airport. We'll start small. We'll have a car wash. We'll send some cheerleaders to regionals.,Michael
You could feed the hungry. Us.,Stanley
Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.,Oscar
"Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.",Michael
We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?,Darryl
Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.,Michael
"Church isn't a party, Michael.",Phyllis
"Well, it's, it's-",Michael
Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?,Ryan
"No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put in your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month.",Michael
"Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs.",Jim
"Fine, fine. I guess I'll watch Suzanne's purse and your baby.",Mee-Maw

"Really? [cheers, applause] Thank you. All right.",Michael
[seeing Michael on the bus] Michael. Get off the bus.,Oscar
"No, I'm not. I'm staying on the bus. I'm already on the bus. I'm going.",Michael
"Michael, this is irresponsible.",Gabe
It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.,Michael
I agree. I think it's superb.,Darryl
"Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales.",Gabe
"You know what, my job will be here when I get back.",Michael
"Michael, you can't go to Mexico. You don't have your passport.",Andy
"[sticking his head out Michael's window on the bus] You don't need one to get in. Plus, we can just have it sent to him down in Mexico.",Guy
"Hey, right?",Michael
"Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?",Phyllis
"Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.",Michael
"Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?",Phyllis
Tell them that I'm in a meeting.,Michael
"Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?",Dwight
"No, you may not.",Michael
Gah!,Dwight

We're actually building them a school.,Guy
Whatever. I won't-I won't stand for it.,Andy
[waving goodbye as the bus drives away] See you in a few months.,Michael
"If the whole world were like you guys, we wouldn't have so many problems.",Girl
Mm. That's not gonna happen.,Michael
We're one in a million.,Andy
I know. Nobody I know would leave their jobs and friends and families to do manual labor for three months.,Girl
"Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So...",Michael
"Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals...",Andy
"[standing in the church sanctuary, talking to the stained glass] Why you always got to be so mean to me?",Toby
"[seeing Cece gone from the couch he left her] Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?",Jim
I don't know. I lost the purse too.,MeeMaw
Okay.,Jim
"Good-bye, Lackawana County.",Andy
How long till we get to Mexico?,Michael
"Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more.",Andy
"Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?",Michael
"I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or...",Andy
Why aren't they building it themselves?,Michael
They don't know how.,Andy
Do we know how? I don't know how. You know how?,Michael
"Well, Carla knows.",Andy
"Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?",Michael
"Oh, trying to sleep.",Carla
"What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?",Michael
"Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese?",Andy
"Oh, God, you know what? I'm gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday.",Michael
And the Christmas party.,Andy
And Cinco de Mayo.,Michael
"Nah, no. We'll be back before that.",Andy
"No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.",Michael
"Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby?",Jim
"Here's her carrier, but no Cece.",Phyllis
"Jim, Jim, I want to give a toast. Where's the little girl of honor?",Jim's Dad
"I don't know, dad. I don't know.",Jim
"I don't mean to bug, but do you know when those subs are due into port? I got a hungry bunch of Mcphersons over there.",Doug
"I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?",Jim
I think maybe some blonde lady had her.,Doug
A small blonde woman?,Jim
Smaller than me.,Doug
"Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!",Jim
[as Kevin runs to grab her] What are you doing?,Angela
[reaching into her purse] Give me the baby!,Kevin

"[holding the baby, walks up to Jim] Hi, honey. I was just changing the baby.",Helene
[baby voice] Hi.,Jim
[walks up] Honey.,Pam
"[to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela.",Jim
Did you think I stole your baby?,Angela
"What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you.",Jim
"[gasping as he looks into Angela's purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?",Kevin
Someone put them in my bag.,Angela
"[to Pam] So that was lunch, eh? Mcpherson troop, let's haul out. Rendezvous at Friendly's.",Doug
Did you lose Cece?,Pam
"Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did.",Jim
Can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?,Michael
I can make myself cry.,Andy
Do that. Do it.,Michael
"Should I-I got it. I got it. [walks up to the bus driver] Um, hey, I saw a sign for a scenic overlook coming up. Really love to check out the view.",Andy
Can't stop. We're on a schedule.,Bus driver
"Well, uh, there's a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road.",Andy
Maybe we'll stop in Tennesseee. It's not safe to talk to a driver.,Bus driver
"[having walked up to the front] Okay, driver, driver, if you're not gonna stop this bus, then I'm going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on. [pulls the string to request a stop, makes a dinging sound]",Michael
Stopping in Tennessee.,Bus driver
"Hey, is there a problem, you guys?",Guy
"Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.",Michael
Why?,Guy
Just make him stop the freaking bus!,Andy
"Stop the bus, okay?",Michael
"Are you okay, sir?",Carla
"I didn't sign up for this. You guys are young, that's great. You want to give back to society. I've done that. I need to take.",Michael
You have plenty left to give. You're doing-,Girl
Blah-di-blah!,Michael
It doesn't matter.,Andy
We could go back and forth all day. It's not gonna solve anything.,Michael
"If we went to Mexico, we'd probably screw everything up anyway.",Andy
"Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you don't. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?",Michael
Stop the bus!,Andy
[shouting and clapping] Stop the bus! Stop the bus!,Michael and Andy
"Okay, stop the dang bus.",Guy
"[bus stopping] Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. We'll keep an eye on America for you.",Michael
[getting off the bus] Wait for me! [bus drives away] Don't say anything to my parents.,Another guy
"[driving up to pick up Michael, Andy, and kid off the road] Get in quick.",Erin
Why quick?,Michael
So it's faster.,Erin
Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?,Erin
Is anyone still at the church?,Michael
"No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.",Erin
What? Shut up.,Michael
"Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan.",Erin
It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.,Michael
I bet. You guys.,Erin
Can I come? [silence],Guy
"Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?",Erin

Police have now surrounded the apartment complex.,Reporter
[whispering to Pam] They have him surrounded. It's the SWAT. The SWAT's arriving.,Michael
It is unknown if he is armed with anything.,Reporter
They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.,Kevin
"[sighs] They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.",Dwight
"Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.",Angela
"Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it's another Waco.",Gabe
It's pronounced wacko.,Erin
"Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.",Jim

Walk with me.,Michael
"Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.",Erin

[confused] Okay?,Jim
Yeah it's a TV show...,Erin

Good me too!,Erin
You know who my favorite character is? The invalid. [Jim makes a face] I am coming to your party.,Michael
"I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.",Erin
"[reacting to Erin's invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!",Kelly
"And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible.",Kelly
Are you going? [to Dwight],Angela
Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.,Dwight
I would watch that.,Angela
Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.,Dwight
[to Erin] You're having a party at Gabe's apartment?,Andy

You would?,Andy
You and Michael are always the life of the party!,Erin

[interrupting] Okay okay okay.,Michael
"Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag.

[tossing pizza dough in the air],Michael
You don't really toss the dough.,Gabe
"Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you. [throws pizza dough, hits the ceiling]",Michael
[walking with Jim and Pam] Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.,Gabe
You play? [referring to keyboard],Jim
"Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.",Gabe
You can't even do that.,Jim
[crying],Cece
She's up! Great!,Pam
"Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I'm up all day and I'm up all night. And if it doesn't stop soon, I am going to be up all night.",Pam
[peeking into various rooms] The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting! [Glee begins as all get nearby to watch],Erin

That's for the other box.,Gabe

"[noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...",Oscar
"You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from...",Kelly
"You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.",Oscar
[enters on Michael alone sitting on a bed watching Glee] Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.,Pam
"Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I'm dead. Okay?",Michael
You have a gun in your desk?,Pam
[in Gabe's bedroom with Andy] Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse.

No what?,Andy
"What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.",Ryan
Yeah.,Andy
"[Pam in the background struggling with Cece] Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated.",Michael

Maybe I should go.,Pam
"[continuing] Kelly. Kev- [to Pam] Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? [Dwight grabs Cece and makes noises, Cece stops crying] In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.",Dwight

"Andy look, all I know is that if I was a girl, and I had to choose between the tall dude who loved Asia, and the you looking dude who loves sweaters and wearing sweaters... I'd choose you.",Daryl
"That's really nice, thank you.",Andy
And I'd blow your mind.,Daryl

If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.,Pam
That would be nice wouldn't it?,Dwight
I can't even talk about it.,Pam
"You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.",Dwight
I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.,Pam
Really? Oh... Then here we are.,Dwight

That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.,Jim

I don't know.,Erin

"Um, everyone was getting their driver's license.",Erin
"Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?",Jim
"Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been... Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it.",Michael

You should've sent me a WUPHF.,Ryan
A what?,Michael

"Oh, it's okay.",Pam
But it's not for--,Erin
Let it go.,Pam
"Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It's actually a great idea and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.",Pam
I think an investor's ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience.,Michael
I love it.,Ryan
"I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I've never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop.",Michael
"Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.",Ryan
Your kidding?!,Michael
"We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.",Ryan
You and me.,Michael
"New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.",Ryan
Don't you work here full-time?,Michael
"[chuckles] Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.",Ryan
Mm-Hmm.,Michael
"Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.",Ryan
That does sound fun to me.,Michael
Awesome.,Ryan
"[out in the parking lot with a guy unloading hay bales while Dwight sifts through the hay] Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.",Dwight
"Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it 'Hay Place'. Eldred Called it 'Hay World'. Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! [guy comes and sticks a Bale of Hay right behing Dwight and knocks it into Dwight] Watch it, watch it.",Dwight
Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.,Dwight
Don't forget to make a broom.,Guy
"Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy!",Dwight
"Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.",Angela
"Roll in the hay, five dollars.",Dwight
"No, I meant... [motions you and me]",Angela
"Oh, our contract.",Dwight
Mm-Hmm.,Angela
"Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. [looks at his watch] Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.",Dwight
Perfect!,Angela
"So, uh... [notices a kid walking on a bale of hay] Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.",Dwight
"[on phone] All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background]",Jim
"I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything. [laughs]",Jim
Commission comes out to... dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero.,Kevin
"Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, Kev.",Jim
"I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, 'dunh-duh-na-dah!' I'm pretty sure I timesed it right.",Kevin
"You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.",Angela
What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?,Jim
It's a new corporate policy.,Angela
Dunh-duh-na-dah!,Kevin
"Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love?",Gabe
"A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?",Jim
"When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean?",Gabe
Nope.,Jim
Nudity makes me uncomfortable.,Gabe
Okay.,Jim
"My gym allows it. I wish they didn't, but it's policy. So I respect it, and I just--[put's his hands cupped by his face and turns away] keep a low--you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room.",Gabe
"Excuse me, everyone... SEX! Now that I have your attention...",Michael
You don't have our attention.,Stanley
MONEY!,Michael
I'm listening.,Stanley
You had me at 'Sex.',Kevin
Pervert.,Michael
You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.,Phyllis
That's good to know. [screams],Michael
"What do you want to say, Michael?",Pam
"Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan.",Michael
How's everybody doing?!,Ryan
Whoo!,Michael
"Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. [Michael, Pam, Daryl, and Stanley raise their hands]",Ryan
"Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space.",Stanley
"For my current investors, things are going great.",Ryan
We already have a buyer.,Michael
Really?! Who?!,Pam
Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.,Ryan
At least.,Michael
So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.,Ryan
"Oh, God. Hold on to your wallets, ladies.",Phyliss
"Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?",Oscar
"No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.",Ryan
That's right!,Michael
"Fun, communication, connection.",Ryan
What's your money situation?,Oscar
"Well, it's tight, as with any start-up.",Ryan
"Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?",Oscar
We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.,Ryan
"I'm sorry, nine days until what?",Andy
Bankruptcy?,Oscar
"Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?",Michael
How long do you think a week is?,Oscar
"No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.",Michael
"Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?",Jim
"Pam. Okay, now I've tried everything.",Jim
Did you prank Dwight?,Pam
No.,Jim
"Well, you like that.",Pam
"Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.",Jim
"I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.",Pam
"[blows a raspberry, Erin looks shocked, Kevin chuckles]",Jim
Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.,Pam
[colorful poster with numbers] Check this out.,Ryan
All that color.,Erin
Look at that. Triple your investment by January.,Michael
Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?,Andy
"Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.",Ryan
There you go.,Michael
You have his email?,Andy
"A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over.",Ryan
I want my money back.,Stanley
"Do not talk like that, Stanley.",Michael
"Ryan, just tell us your plan.",Pam
"Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.",Ryan
"[hits the back of a Dunder-Mifflin Delivery Truck with his hand] Hey kids, was that fun?",Dwight
Yeah!,Kids
All Right!,Dwight
I wanna go on it again.,Kid
"Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. [kid gives him three more bucks]",Dwight
"Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.",Dwight
"[waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]",Angela
Where have you been?! I've been waiting.,Angela
"Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?",Dwight
"No, I--I think you should make time for it.",Angela
I found the needle in the haystack!,Little Girl
"Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?",Dwight
I don't know!,Little Girl
Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.,Dwight
Dwight?,Angela
"WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach.",Ryan
Here we go.,Michael
"Everyone's like, 'Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?' Or, Uh, 'Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!'",Ryan
It's Ryan the WUPHF guy!',Michael
"Yo, Ry from WUPHF!'",Ryan
He's up there.',Michael
"What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!' WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!",Ryan
Look at that! He threw 'em on the ground!,Michael
"Look, this is a marketing campgain. You got nine days. Let's say you do get the money. What are you going to do with it?",Daryl
"The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.",Ryan
That sounds weird.,Andy
"No, it's not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that.",Michael
"[walks in] Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?",Kelly
"I said to Ryan, 'I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!''",Kelly
"Baby, Baby, Baby--",Ryan
I think I'm gonna stay here.,Kelly
"No, no, no, no, no.",Ryan
"I do, I do. This isn't right.",Kelly
I help you with your things and you help me with my things.,Ryan
But I--it's not right.,Kelly

"Yeah, sell!",Daryl
"Yeah, sell.",Andy
Sell.,Pam
Get us out of this!,Stanley
Have some faith in this idea!,Ryan
"If everybody wants to sell, we sell, right?",Daryl
I won't sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right?,Michael
"Yes. You alone do, actually.",Ryan
I--yes. We're not selling. I will not sell.,Michael
[runs to and inside the Hay Place maze] Awesome!,Kevin
Do you mind if we share this bale?,Man
Sure.,Angela
"There's no charge to sit on the hay, is there?",Man
Probably.,Angela
"I mean, wouldn't you think the ten dollars to build your own broom would include the hay and not just the instructions?",Man
Mm-Hmm.,Angela
"I mean, I'm starting to think this guy is just trying to make money off the holiday.",Man
"Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. [man laughs] Don't laugh at me.",Angela
"No, no, no, I wasn't--I was just laughing at your joke.",Man
Oh.,Angela
Pay Place.,Man
"Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]",Angela

I'm sure no one asked you to do that.,Pam
[throws the sack of garbage onto the floor] Eight Years.,Michael
"Listen, I know you really like Ryan--",Pam
"No, I won't even consider it.",Michael
"Michael, I... [sits down] I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something?",Pam
"Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor.",Michael
"Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you.",Pam
I think you are wrong.,Michael
And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.,Pam
You may be right. I may be crazy.,Michael
Don't.,Pam
I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point.,Michael
"Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing.",Pam

"The moment Darla put the cupcake in her mouth, her daddy pulled her aside and said, 'You're Too Fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat.' The next time I saw David Geffen was at the buffalo club. 'I love you, you Gay Bastard,' I said. 'You Gay Bastard,' I s--. 'Gay Ba--' 'Gay B--''",Jo
"Michael, how's it going, bro?",Ryan
"Good, good, bro.",Michael
"Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.",Ryan
"Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?",Michael
"I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.",Ryan
"Nine days, though. That's, like...",Michael
"Look, I know I've tapped you so hard.",Ryan
"Yes, you have tapped this. Hard.",Michael
"[laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit.",Ryan
Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.,Michael
"Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.",Ryan
So you would think that's a good idea for me to do?,Michael
Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--,Ryan
Mm-Hmm.,Michael
Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.,Ryan
"Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so...",Michael
We totally should.,Ryan
Tonight?,Michael
I gotta work on this.,Ryan
Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.,Michael
Yeah. [Michael closes the door],Ryan
"And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. [crowd applauds] Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. [crowd applauds] And let's hear it for... Purebred. [crowd applauds] Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... [all three contestants begging for Dwight to pick them] Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King! [drowd leaves disgusted, as Dwight's worker claps]",Dwight
Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.,Dwight
"So, if I were to call Dunder Mifflin and ask for Miss Angela Martin, would I get through to you?",Man
"You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?",Angela
My wife passed away a few years ago.,Man
How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.,Angela
Thank You.,Man

"[opens the door the Ryan's office, grabs him by the shirt, pulls him out of his chair] Consider it a WUPHF in person. [shoves Ryan down to a chair]",Daryl
Your doing the wrong thing. You're gonna lose Michael's investment. You're gonna lose ours.,Andy
You got this crazy opportunity to get our money back. Tell Mike To Sell.,Daryl
"If you tell Michael to sell, he'll sell.",Andy
I'm betting on myself.,Ryan
It's a bad bet.,Stanley
Hello.,Michael
Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?,Ryan
"It's not that we don't believe in the company, We don't believe in you.",Daryl
"All those in favor of selling, say aye. [all say 'aye']",Andy
"I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.",Michael
What is wrong with you? What happened to you in High School?,Daryl
"Michael, are you that blind?",Stanley
"I'm not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend. [all seem to be in agreenment] And he's also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn't, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground.",Michael
You're gonna lose all of our money.,Andy
"Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody's money.",Michael
"Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.",Ryan
You can't have it.,Michael
Okay. I won't let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door],Ryan
"Angela? [slides open the door] Angela! [see's a note on the door, reads it, and then crumples it up]",Dwight
"The world sends people your way... Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you're dealt. [camera pans to different people in the office] Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That's easy. Gimme a hard one. That's what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam's a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So... [phone rings, computer chimes, etc.] That's Uh...",Michael

"Now, I love reading, and I hate being interrupted. Shut up and listen, you gay bastard. Chapter One. I was born, not into luxary, nor poverty.

Why?,Jim
"Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot.

Do you mind?,Pam
"I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.",Dwight
You don't have to do that.,Pam

"Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them.

"[examines items on the reception desk] Mmhmm, China. China.",Michael
How was the dentist?,Erin
It was great. China.,Michael
"Are you okay, what's wrong?",Pam
"Everything here was made in China, Pam.",Michael
"Yeah, its where they make stuff.",Andy
"They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we're falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.",Michael
"Oh, no.",Erin
"Yeah, right here. It is right there. [holds up magazine] Anybody read the news any more?",Michael
China is on the move?,Dwight
"I found that in the waiting room at the dentist's office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, that's the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again.",Michael
"My whole life I believed that America was number one, that was the saying. Not America is number two. England is number two. China should be like eight.",Michael
Hey Andy.,Darryl
Hey Darryl.,Andy
You gotta stop texting me so much.,Darryl
But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It's insane.,Andy
You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.,Darryl
Got it. Then I will call you.,Andy
No.,Darryl
"There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. 'I'm coming over baby.' And I would text back 'BTB', bring that booty.",Darryl
"Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?",Stanley
"I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.",Dwight
"Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to...",Pam
Don't tell me how to do my business.,Stanley
"Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.",Dwight
Which is you.,Jim
Which is you' is not a sentence.,Dwight
I disagree with.,Jim
"Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?",Stanley
"Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks.",Pam
"Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.",Dwight
I'm not going to do that.,Pam
"Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy.",Dwight
[on the phone] Y'ello.,Nate
"Hi Nate, Its Pam Halpert.",Pam
"Oh, hey Pam.",Nate
"Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight.",Pam
Let me put you on hold for just one 'eensy sec.,Nate
Sure.,Pam

"[hangs up phone] Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends.",Pam
"You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. [Kevin smiles]",Dwight
Oh my God.,Erin
What?,Michael
"According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.",Erin
So much for keeping our secrets up high.,Michael
What's America gonna do?,Erin
I know what we're going to do. We're going to put our best minds on it.,Michael
"Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes.",Michael
You never told us to close them.,Angela
Welcome to your future.,Michael
What do we do? How do we stop this?,Phyllis
"How do we stop it? With a big idea. That's what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?",Michael
An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?,Pam
"Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin.",Michael
An antacid that you only take once a week.,Kevin
Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes.,Michael
Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.,Kevin
Why not just go one for the year?,Stanley
I don't know.,Michael
It's too big of a pill to swallow.,Kevin
Alright.,Michael
"What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?",Erin
"I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.",Erin
I don't know what the [expletive] that was.,Michael
"I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve.",Dwight
"Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb.",Phyllis
"No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.",Michael
[gasps],Erin
"Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now.",Oscar
Thank God.,Kevin
"No, no. That is right now.",Michael
"Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian.",Oscar
"In terms of land, not population.",Michael
Come on Michael. You can...,Oscar
"No, no you're wrong about this.",Michael
Where are you getting this information?,Oscar
I got it from NewYorkTimes.com,Michael
"Uh oh, getting nervous Oscar?",Kevin
"Okay, someone look it up.",Jim
I'm on it Jim. I'm on it.,Ryan
Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.,Oscar
[reads text] 'Are you watching this?' Seriously?,Darryl
Well are you?,Andy
I'm sitting right here.,Darryl
Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.,Ryan
Suck it Oscar.,Meredith
"Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.",Jim
Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?,Oscar
So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what? [laughs] I don't care.,Michael
"Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar?",Michael
"Wow, so this building can get uglier.",Meredith
I will not work in a roach billboard.,Stanley
"Oh my God, I can't look at roaches.",Gabe
Michael do something about this.,Angela
"Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.",Michael
Dwight take it down.,Pam
[chuckles],Dwight
"I'm serious, take it down or else.",Pam
Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.,Dwight
We can move out.,Pam
"[lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]",Angela
"So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours?",Pam
"Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?",Jim
I went out to look for a better office space.,Pam
Waste of time.,Dwight
"Not really, because I found one.",Pam
"Oh wow, these are nice.",Jim
Yup.,Pam
Let me see.,Dwight
"Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.",Pam
"Yeah, yeah. Totally.",Jim
You can't just move out.,Dwight
"Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.",Pam
[without looking at the pictures] Oh my gosh she is so cute. She looks like both of you.,Andy
They're not of Cece.,Pam
"Oh, cool.",Andy
This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.,Pam
Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.,Phyllis
"Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.",Pam
Are you trying to kill me?,Stanley
Is the nail place Koreans or whites?,Kelly
Koreans.,Pam
Good. And the dry cleaners?,Kelly
White.,Pam
Good.,Kelly
"Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.",Jim
Funny Jim. That is funny.,Oscar
Very comedically humorous Jim.,Michael
I have a computer question. Hey Oscar?,Kelly
What is it?,Oscar
Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?,Kelly
Alright. Alright I get it.,Oscar
"Michael, how do I create a new tab?",Kelly
Try 'Control P'.,Michael
That's print.,Oscar
Not if the printer isn't hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.,Michael
Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.,Kelly
"He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.",Oscar
"Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.",Kelly
"Actually, it was.",Ryan
"Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.",Jim
[reading text] Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?,Darryl
Megan Fox! Come on!,Andy
"You know what, you're one bad text away from getting blocked.",Darryl
"Yes, but one good text away from a high five.",Andy
You accept these terms?,Darryl
"Oh, its on.",Andy
"In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list.",Dwight
"Well, I wish for a million wishes.",Kevin
"Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a...",Dwight
Then see you later building.,Kevin
You can't possibly be serious.,Dwight
I said see you later building.,Kevin
Hey Michael.,Oscar
Hey.,Michael
I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.,Oscar
Mmm.,Michael
I'd love to talk more about it.,Oscar
Yeah.,Michael
Maybe over some coffee later?,Oscar
Sure.,Michael
"Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?",Jim
Coffee Jim.,Michael
No.,Jim
It is not just coffee.,Andy
"He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?",Jim
Yes.,Michael
And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.,Andy
"Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay, okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary.",Michael
No politics?,Jim
"I'm pretty good on politics. 'California is bankrupt, and California, California.' [Jim and Andy follow Michael into his office] What?",Michael
"Parley, my office, five minutes.",Dwight
Parley?,Pam
"Pirate code, he wants to meet.",Creed
So everyone here knows pirate code?,Pam
"I understand it, I can't speak it.",Creed
"Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.",Dwight
You've been watering down the soap?,Pam
Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?,Dwight
We need everything back the way it was.,Pam
"You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous... for stripping.",Dwight
"That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed. [lights turn off, Pam and Dwight begin to wave their arms to alert the sensor]",Pam
Where is Tibet?,Ryan
Pass.,Michael
When was China founded?,Ryan
Pass.,Michael
"Two for two, keep it up.",Jim
Who is Mao?,Ryan
Lifeline.,Michael
"Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don't know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know.",Andy
I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs.,Michael
What do you know about boobs?,Jim
"Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II.",Andy
Thank you.,Jim
"This guy doesn't just wanna win. Y'know, he want's to bury you. He wants to humiliate you!",Andy
"Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?",Michael
I'm like a quarter of the way through.,Andy
Is it going to be worth it?,Michael
No.,Andy
"Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.",Ryan
I don't need to cheat.,Michael
Show him how to use it.,Jim
"[riding in car, looking for new office] Ten thousand seven hundred and six.",Nate
"Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.",Dwight
Yeah.,Nate
There's no building. This could only mean one thing.,Dwight
The building's underground?,Nate
"She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam...",Dwight
"Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam.",Dwight & Nate
Yeah?,Passer-by
Pam. Pam?,Nate
What?,Dwight
I'm Pam.,Passer-by
Oh.,Dwight
No you're not.,Nate
I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.,Dwight
"Oh, that's fine.",Passer-by
"So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?",Dwight
I've been known to bend the truth.,Passer-by
"Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.",Dwight
Okay.,Passer-by
"I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.",Dwight
Hey Pam.,Dwight
Yeah?,Pam
"Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office.",Dwight
"I know, because you're the reason we're moving.",Pam
"Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?",Dwight
"Uhh, I think it's something like umm...",Pam
What's the exact square footage.,Dwight
"Umm, let me see.",Pam
How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.,Dwight
"Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet.",Pam
"[chuckles] You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say 'Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is.' I can't wait.",Dwight
Mmhmm.,Pam
I lied about some aspects of the building.,Pam
It's still on a bike path though right?,Jim
There's no building... it doesn't exist.,Pam
What does that mean?,Jim
"I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna...",Pam
What?,Jim
Fail. I don't want to fail... again.,Pam
But you didn't fail.,Jim
"And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales.",Pam
And you didn't fail those things either.,Jim
"Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it?",Pam
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.",Jim
"Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.",Oscar
"Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?",Michael
We have missiles too.,Oscar
"Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that's just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon.",Michael
I wasn't here. [places a book in front of Pam],Nate
What?,Pam
I wasn't here. It's a pretty common saying. You may want to log it away for future use.,Nate
Well thanks.,Pam
Yeah.,Nate
China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us.,Michael
"Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.",Oscar
How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?,Michael
Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?,Oscar
Don't... I...,Michael
"Hello, hello. You're breaking the law.",Pam
"Impossible, I love the law.",Dwight
"Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.",Pam
"I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.",Dwight
I don't think it goes that way.,Nate
Reply it!,Dwight
"Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.",Oscar
"Yeah, I figured that.",Michael
"Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.",Oscar
Wait. You forgetting something?,Michael
What?,Oscar
"This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.",Michael
"Fire him. No, show mercy.",Erin
Here we are.,Michael
What's your point.,Oscar
"My point is... that as long as people like you and me don't stop talking, nobody can stop the USA.",Michael
Yeah. [clapping],Andy
"Right, yes.",Erin
"I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don't think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don't, that's fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation.",Michael
That's not.,Oscar
Raise your cups on high. Case closed.,Michael
That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...,Oscar
"They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.",Dwight
[reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?,Darryl
Shhh. You're gonna scare 'em away. [two pigeons are eating out of a soft serve cone],Andy
[laughs] That's a text. [high fives Andy],Darryl
Yeah. Right.,Andy
That's your new standard.,Darryl
Got it. [taking a group photo outside],Nate
Okay let's go in. I'm freezing.,Pam
"People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one.",Michael
One Charlie's Angels. One. Let's go.,Jim
"Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge.",Pam
"Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'.",Kevin
Let's just jump in the air!,Andy
That's it! That's a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air. Here we go.,Michael
Okay.,Pam
"One, two, three. [everyone jumps at different times] Not everyone jumped.",Nate
"Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.",Michael
"One, two, three. [everyone jumps] Still some people not jumping.",Nate
You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?,Jim
"I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.",Dwight
I am jumping.,Phyllis
You are?,Dwight
"Yes, I'm jumping.",Phyllis
"Let me see you jump. [Phyllis barely jumps] Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.",Dwight
I'm freezing.,Pam
"Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by 'three'.",Nate
I didn't want to miss it.,Erin
"Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that.",Andy
Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?,Oscar
"Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes?",Michael
Why?,Oscar
I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.,Michael
"Okay, on three. Uh, everyone in the air. Three, [some people jump] two, [others jump] one, [others jump] zero. [everyone begins to yell]",Nate
We didn't get it.,Michael
"I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.",Pam
It hardly looks fake. It's so lush.,Pam
Why's it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah... good one.,Jim
"Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children! [dressed as Santa]",Michael
Merry Christmas.,All
How's everybody doing today?,Michael
Good.,Erin
How's the party coming along?,Michael
Great.,Pam
Are we over budget?,Michael
Nope.,Pam
No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?,Michael
Not yet!,Meredith
"Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What's the problem?",Michael
Nothing. Should be fun.,Angela
"So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?",Michael
[cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.,Stanley
"Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?",Michael
Yea?,Andy
Whatcha got?,Michael
"All good, Santa.",Andy
"Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!",Michael
"My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that's what I want. That's what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama.",Michael
"It's present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.",Kelly
We just want to say how grateful we are.,Gabe
"Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, 'Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do.'",Kelly
It's a Hello Kitty laptop sleeve.,Kelly
Hello Kitty's for girls.,Andy
Nashua got mp3 players.,Pam
"Yeah, I don't even have a laptop.",Phyllis
I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.,Kelly
Wow.,Meredith
Oh God.,Phyllis
Oh come on.,Dwight
"I said, 'I wonder.' I didn't say, 'I think.'",Kelly
"Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.",Gabe
"Blankets, what am I, five?",Kelly
Erin and I make great use of ours.,Gabe
"Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating?",Gabe
I'll take one of those pink pouches.,Darryl
"I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking.",Darryl
"Hey, it's snowing.",Jim
"[mocking] Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.",Dwight
"[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]",Jim
"Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!",Dwight
"Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?",Jim
Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.,Dwight
"Oh, don't be such a baby.",Phyllis
"Yeah, who's a little girl now? [everyone laughs]",Stanley
You apologize to me right now.,Dwight
You've got something on your nose.,Jim
You apologize right now.,Dwight
No.,Jim
"Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.",Dwight
You got it.,Jim
That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?,Andy
"No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight's hand] Jim, let go. Let go.",Dwight
"Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.",Kevin
I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.,Angela
State senator.,Oscar
I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.,Angela
Who are you dating in the public arena?,Oscar
The senator.,Angela
"Oh, right. The state senator.",Kevin
We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.,Angela
"Oh, that would be impressive... if",Kevin
Well...,Oscar
"Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. 'Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'over here, Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'here. Look here!'",Angela
"Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...",Pam
Yeah!,Michael
A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.,Pam
Pam? Pam?,Michael
Pam?,Dwight
"Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.",Pam
Hi guys.,Toby
Hi.,Michael
"Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.",Toby
"Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?",Michael
"Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.",Toby
"Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!",Michael
Death to Toby!,Dwight
"Okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that. You know, I don't interrupt your announcements.",Toby
"You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?",Michael
"What's the case, Toby?",Phyllis
"Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high profile case.",Toby
Is it criminal?,Andy
Yes.,Toby
Have we heard of it?,Andy
I don't know.,Toby
Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?,Dwight
Come on.,Toby
Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?,Meredith
"Guys, it's a really big deal. [rubs his neck]",Toby
He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!,Ryan
He's rubbing his neck.,Kelly
He's rubbing his neck.,Ryan
"Oh, Scranton Strangler! [all react]",Andy
I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty. [excited outbursts],Toby
That was the worst joke ever.,Michael
Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.,Toby
"Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.",Michael
"Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.",Toby
What? What?,Michael
"Yeah, uh, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.",Toby
"Hold on, Holly's coming back here?",Michael
Yeah.,Toby
"Guys, who's Holly?",Erin
"That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?",Michael
Wow.,Erin
She's one sassy black lady.,Creed
"Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.",Michael
I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.,Gabe
"You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.",Michael
Okay.,Dwight
Cancel. We're canceling it. [Michael starts to throw away all of the food],Michael
"No, don't throw those out!",Angela
"No, we have to cancel the party.",Michael
We can save that.,Angela
"No, no, no, we're gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.",Michael
I bought these.,Andy
I know.,Michael
These cookies are fine.,Andy
It's not. They're not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.,Michael
"Michael, Michael, wait we don't have, we don't have the budget for another party.",Pam
"Well then everybody'll chip in, it'll be fine.",Michael
"I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen.",Pam
"You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. It doesn't matter. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.",Michael
"Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away.",Michael
"We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool. [imitating Sean Connery] The name is Bond... Santa Bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa... wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus... God! Ow! [camera pans down to Angela pinning Michael's pants]",Michael
Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.,Angela
"Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa.",Michael
Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.,Angela
Okay. Sure.,Michael
"I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party.",Angela
You never know about the press.,Michael
"Well, I only ask because he's a senator.",Angela
Could he help us with some parking tickets?,Michael
I don't think that's appropriate.,Angela
"Well, then he's not a senator.",Michael
"Yes, he is.",Angela
Okay.,Michael
Hey.,Jim
Hey.,Pam
"We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.",Jim
"Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year.",Pam
Me neither. Whew.,Jim
Okay.,Pam
"I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good.",Pam
"[A note is on Jim's computer that says, 'It is time. Parking lot at noon.' Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]",Jim
"Okay... [sighs] Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!",Michael
"No, it has the little...",Pam
"Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.",Michael
"Hi, I'm looking for Michael Scott.",Bass Player
"Yes, that's me. Come on it.",Michael
"[scats awkwardly] There's nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?",Michael
"Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?",Pam
"I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.",Kevin
Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.,Pam
"I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.",Andy
Yeah.,Kevin
"I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.",Andy
"Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him.",Pam
You know Darryl?,Andy
Yeah. He works here. We all know him.,Pam
"I should come along, just 'cause he's my, you know, he's my hookup.",Andy
Cool.,Pam
"Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.",Darryl
[on the phone] I'm not doing it! She told me she wants to have Christmas here.,Justine
She did?,Darryl
Yes. She wants to be around family for Christmas.,Justine
I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.,Darryl
"[Pam knocks on Darryl's door] Don't come in, I'm busy. [Pam opens the door]",Darryl
"It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too.",Andy
"Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck.",Pam
"Uh, no.",Darryl
"Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.",Andy
No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.,Darryl
"Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone.",Pam
"Hey... [sighs] You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it.",Darryl
"When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.",Michael
I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet.,Erin
"She doesn't need an internet presence, you just know.",Michael
Oh...,Erin
Hey.,Toby
What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse.,Michael
"Uh, we're on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone.",Toby
"Hi, Toby.",Kevin
What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.,Meredith
Yeah.,Kevin
That scowl.,Meredith
I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury.,Toby
"And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.",Michael
"I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking.",Toby
"[standing outside, dials Dwight's cell phone]",Jim
[voicemail recording] You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave... [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.],Dwight
Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!,Dwight
Stop! Stop!,Jim
Ahh!,Dwight
Oh... oh!,Jim
"[grunting, shouting]",Dwight
I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.,Dwight
"[dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off]",Dwight
"Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] 'How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.'",Jim
Hi.,Holly
Hello.,Erin
"Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?",Holly
"I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive.",Erin
"There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake?",Michael
"Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry.",Erin
Hello.,Michael
"[weak Clint Eastwood accent] Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old bastard.",Holly
"[imitating her accent] Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard.",Michael
"Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.",Holly
"[as Curly] Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh?",Michael
[as Curly] I most certainly am.,Holly
"Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!",Michael
Unnnnnnngh!,Holly
[as Homer] D'oh!,Michael
"[as Marge] Oh, Homey. [they both laugh]",Holly
Okay... Holly's back.,Jim
Hi. Hi. Oh... [they hug],Michael
"[in monster voice] Oh, huggy monster!",Holly
"Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! [both sigh] Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.",Michael
Hi.,Holly
Did you bring us anything from Nashua?,Kevin
"Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.",Holly
That's adorable.,Michael
Would you put those out?,Holly
"To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?",Erin
"Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers.",Holly
"Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.",Michael
"Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did.",Holly
"Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. [in a stereotyped Mexican accent] I show you to your desk.",Michael
[in the same accent] Watch out for my guns they're both loaded. [makes gun noises],Holly
What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?,Michael
Aww...,Jim
It's a pea shoot...,Holly
This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it?,Michael
"Yeah, kind of.",Holly
Oh...,Michael
Oh...,Holly
"Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! [the both chuckle] Oh, I love toy...",Michael
AJ gave me that.,Holly
"Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?",Michael
Mmhmm.,Holly
You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom.,Michael
Why?,Holly
"Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.",Michael
That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn't seen any of the Toy Story movies.,Holly
You're kidding me. Ahh!,Michael
"No. I know. I was like, 'What? Are you serious?'",Holly
What a douche bag!,Michael
Get a life!,Holly
Get a... yeah! Good riddance.,Michael
We sat down and we watched them all in one day.,Holly
Mmhmm.,Michael
Now he's the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.,Holly
Good for him.,Michael
Next day I found him in my bed.,Holly
Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house?,Michael
We live together.,Holly
"Oh, you do?",Michael
"He had a little note pinned to him that said, 'You've got a friend in me.'",Holly
"[fighting back tears] Yeah, Randy Newman's the best.",Michael
Yeah. I love him.,Holly
Me too.,Michael
"[singing] Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree.",Andy
"Hey, how about this one?",Pam
"Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?",Andy
Maybe. I mean...,Pam
"[on the phone] I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, [Justine hangs up] oh... pick a damn tree already.",Darryl
"Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too.",Pam
"I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself.",Andy
"Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.",Darryl
"Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.",Pam
Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.,Darryl
"No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.",Pam
How do I do that?,Darryl
"Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun.",Pam
Yes.,Andy
You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.,Pam
"Hey guys, the tree's here.",Pam
Hey.,Michael
"Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so...",Andy
Why would someone hug you?,Oscar
"Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome.",Michael
Are you serious?,Darryl
It's a sophisticated take.,Michael
He doesn't look like Santa Claus.,Jada
"No, he doesn't. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.",Darryl
"Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.",Michael
Who told you that?,Pam
"Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.",Michael
So is it an open relationship?,Phyllis
"Oh, God, no.",Holly
"Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?",Kelly
"Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together.",Holly
So where's the ring?,Kelly
"Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?",Pam
"Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.",Phyllis
"You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.",Pam
"Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away.",Erin
"I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!",Erin
"Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over.",Holly
"Wow, an ultimatum.",Pam
Yeah.,Holly
It doesn't really seem like you.,Pam
"That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.",Kelly
[turns in Pam's chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally],Dwight
"Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!",Jim
"Oh, no. Oh, no!",Dwight
Stop!,Jim
"Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!",Dwight
Okay. Okay. Okay.,Jim
Huh? You like that?,Dwight
Seriously!,Jim
Huh?,Dwight
Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally],Jim
"Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.",Dwight
I just want it to stop.,Jim
"So, cool right?",Pam
There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.,Ryan
Okay.,Pam
"We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.",Ryan
"Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?",Pam
"Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?",Ryan
"I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...",Pam
"Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?",Ryan
No.,Pam
Okay.,Ryan
"Oh, Jim. Hey.",Toby
"Hey, Toby.",Jim
"There's this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse...",Toby
No way.,Jim
Who looks exactly like you.,Toby
That's increadible.,Jim
"Yeah. No, it's uncanny.",Toby
You know what's crazy?,Jim
What?,Toby
"I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]",Jim
"I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. [clip of Michael throwing Holly's Woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it]",Michael
It's so cold. Even with my coat on.,Angela
Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car... for screwing Americans.,Meredith
Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.,Gabe
"You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.",Holly
"What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.",Michael
I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.,Dwight
What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.,Jim
"With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.",Dwight
"Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.",Holly
"All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? [he holds up a toy taxi cab] Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.",Michael
"Wait, what girlfriend?",Dwight
I haven't told you about her.,Michael
I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.,Dwight
"I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, 'Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab.'",Michael
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.,Holly
I do. She is.,Michael
Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain't Tara.,Michael
So you went homemade this year.,Phyllis
Yup.,Pam
"Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.",Phyllis
"No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.",Pam
Are you good at homemade?,Phyllis
Look at this.,Pam
Yeah...,Phyllis
"[walks in with a dirty Woody] Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving.",Holly
"Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.",Phyllis
That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.,Erin
"What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting.",Michael
"No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.",Toby
"Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much.",Michael
"Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself.",Kevin
It is Christmas.,Michael
"No, it really seems like something Michael would do.",Angela
"Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.",Michael
Why would anyone frame you for that?,Andy
"Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?",Jim
"Ahhhhhh! [laughs] Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?",Michael
You think this is funny?,Holly
[laughs] I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...,Michael
Yikes. [everyone gasps],Jim
"Oh no, that's, that's not happening.",Kevin
Dear God in heaven.,Dwight
"All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.",Michael
"Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore.",Holly
"Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought.",Michael
"Okay, hey, hey, hey...",Dwight
"No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.",Jim
You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?,Holly
"When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, 'Michael, I love you, but I can't do this.' But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.",Michael
"Michael, I'm sorry.",Holly
And we did this whole stupid party for you.,Michael
[blocks Holly's path] No.,Erin
"You guys, it wasn't my fault.",Holly
"Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!",Kevin
I really think you're better off.,Erin
"Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?",Michael
Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?,Erin
"[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] 'Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.' [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!",Jim
"Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.",Dwight
"So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?",Stanley
"No, they bring it in.",Toby
You lucky son of a bitch.,Stanley
"I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life.",Stanley
"Daddy, I'm bored. Can I read my book in your office?",Jada
"Sure, sweetie.",Darryl
"Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?",Pam
"Oh, my goodness.",Pam
I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.,Andy
"Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!",Darryl
What kind of challenges.,Jada
Wahhh...,Andy
"Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?",Pam
No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?,Andy
I don't know.,Jada
Do you know the other state?,Andy
"Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold.",Darryl
"The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear! [pulls star from coat and pretends to find it behind Jada's ear]",Andy
And the game's over seconds later.,Darryl
I'm so glad you could come.,Angela
It's nice. I know.,Robert

Was I supposed to bring you guys something?,AJ
What? AJ!,Holly

Thank you very much.,Creed
Mmhmm.,Angela
"I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.",Angela
"Wow, that's awesome!",Kevin
A real David and Goliath story.,Oscar
I'm just so touched that she's so interested in my work.,Robert
I am.,Angela
The real problem is the teachers' union.,Meredith
"Zip it, Meredith.",Angela
No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read.,Meredith
"Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?",Ryan
You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans],Angela
I'll make it. What are you drinking.,Oscar
An 'F' train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters.,Ryan
I don't know how to make that.,Oscar
"Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito.",Ryan
"And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest.",Angela
Annoying.,Meredith
Yes.,Angela
"[Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.",Pam
"Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]",Jim

"Ooh, go easy with the shaking.",Jim
"[lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God.",Pam
You like it?,Jim
I love it.,Pam
"Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.",Jim
"Alright, my turn.",Jim
"Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder.",Pam
"Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] 'The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.' Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.",Jim
I mean... [speechless],Jim
"Michael, wait!",Pam
"Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip.",Michael
That's good advice.,Pam
"Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.",Michael
That's a sad story.,Pam
"[voice breaking] Yeah, well, at least he was married.",Michael
"Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay.",Pam
"No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.",Michael
"I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.",Pam
Really?,Michael
"Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?",Pam
No.,Michael
So just be patient.,Pam
"Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall.",Michael
I surrender.,Jim
I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.,Dwight
Anything. You got it.,Jim

This is a fast food receipt from April.,Kelly
"Well, that...",Michael
"God, how many number nines did you order?",Kelly
Is everyone here kind of mean?,AJ
"Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial.",Holly
Oh.,AJ
"Hey, I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected.",Holly
"Hey, what happened to Woody?",AJ
"Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.",Holly
He smells awful.,AJ
It was blue cheese dressing.,Holly
Great.,AJ
"Hey, Mike.",Darryl
Hey.,Michael

"Next up, secretary Schrute will read the minutes from Sunday's meeting.",Man
"Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!",Dwight
Oh.,Jim
This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.,Dwight
"Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels. One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.",Dwight
"I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.",Jim
"No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!",Dwight
"Dwight, don't be bothered by your friend's presence.",Man

"I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.",Jim
"Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.",Dwight

Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.,Dwight
Smart.,Jim
And the rest was just [mumbles]stuff.,Dwight
"Go ahead and read it, some people weren't here.",Man
Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.,Dwight
"Oh, come on, that sounds awesome.",Jim
It was pretty cool.,Member

It was pretty awesome.,Dwight
"[answers phone] Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.",Jim
"January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. Holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, let's switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, let's push through. We'll do this.",Michael
"Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Year's or they break up. Now, if she's engaged, I'm gonna go crazy, and I'm gonna start attacking people. If she's not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.",Michael
"[filming video] Michael, I know what you're thinking. Holly's engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it's not.",Michael
"[giggles] Snot. Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot. I am so sorry.",Erin
"Okay, so killing yourself. [laughs] I was just thinking about snot.",Michael
Good morning.,Angela

Wow. Did your baby draw that?,Dwight
The glitter is blinding.,Angela
I think it's good.,Phyllis
It's gonna be fun.,Pam
"I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she's awesome.",Pam

Both sad.,Michael
And did you get the tickets?,Erin
"I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. 'Hey, you think you can do my job better?' I don't know. 'What's your name?' Michael.",Michael
"I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!",Erin
"Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine. His name is New Year's resolution board.",Pam
Shaaa-shut up. Hello.,Michael

"Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever.",Dwight
"Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes.",Michael
[Holly takes off mittens revealing no ring on her ring finger] Congratu-ohhh.,Kevin
Wow.,Kelly
Oh my God! That's it! That's it!,Michael
"Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum.",Holly
"Yes, I told everyone.",Kelly

"Well, maybe you'll meet someone.",Pam
"No, some people don't just meet someone. I'm fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It's not a party at all. It's just sad.",Andy
Angela.,Pam
Yes.,Angela
Make time for romance!,Pam

My boyfriend.,Angela
"Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'.",Oscar
Ugh.,Angela
"Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is... meet a loose woman.",Dwight

"Holly doesn't seem to be engaged, but she's talking to AJ like she is. I can't figure it out. Do you think she's already dating a different AJ?",Michael
I don't think so.,Pam
"When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?",Michael
No.,Pam
But you did still love him.,Michael
I'm not... I'm not going to have...,Pam
Do you love him now?,Michael
No! Just talk to her.,Pam
"No. She'd just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend. [disgusted voice] Oh, hi friend! Blegh.",Michael
"I'll talk to her, Michael.",Phyllis
You think she'd talk to you?,Michael
Why wouldn't she?,Phyllis
That's true. She's really nice. She'd talk to anybody. Why don't you bring Erin to balance you out?,Michael
There's a plan.,Pam

No.,Phyllis
No.,Erin
"So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?",Phyllis
"Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year's deadline, but um, it came and went... and, we're still together.",Holly
"You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?",Phyllis
It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're going to be just fine. Just fine.,Holly
Whoa! Hold on.,Darryl
I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.,Dwight
"[Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.",Darryl
"Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.",Dwight
"I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.",Darryl
"Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.",Dwight

How is it going?,Pam
I'm having a little trouble motivating.,Creed
"One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.",Pam
Or sooner.,Michael
Yeah.,Pam
That's not a joke.,Michael
"But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying. In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions?",Pam
"Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.",Kevin
"Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine.",Pam
Is it?,Michael
"Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.",Pam
"Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12:01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.",Michael
Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.,Kevin
"What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!",Michael
"Well, I can't, I don't know how.",Creed
You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone? Loser.,Michael
"My tombstone's already made, thank you.",Creed
Just do a cartwheel!,Michael
This is all I could find.,Erin

"I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.",Kevin
Why are you eating stem first?,Kelly
"This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?",Kevin
The other way.,Ryan
Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?,Kevin
"No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go.",Michael
"Oh, Michael.",Pam
"Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it.",Michael
"God, I hate it.",Kevin
I don't care whether you hate it! You said you'd do it!,Michael
All right!,Angela
Eat it!,Michael
"You're killing him, Michael!",Kelly
"All right, all right, shh!",Michael
"All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?",Kevin
"Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue. [reveals hidden broccoli, spits it out] Oh, God! You guys are pathetic.",Michael
"Can I get some candy, or something?",Kevin
No! You can't have any candy!,Michael
I'll get him water.,Oscar
"Okay, Michael, just settle down.",Pam
[imitating E.T.] Holly Flax.,Michael
"Yes, Michael?",Holly
"[imitating E.T.] Not Michael, E.T.",Michael
What's up?,Holly
"Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there.",Michael
"Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just... I don't want to talk about it.",Holly
"Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.",Michael
You think?,Creed
"And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.",Michael
You were super mean.,Kevin
It was insensitive and I am sorry.,Michael
"It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.",Kevin
"I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line.",Michael
"Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.",Kevin
You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends.,Michael
"I don't think I'm there yet, Boss.",Creed
"Well, I am. [hugs Michael]",Kevin
"Okay, oh! All right.",Michael
I'm going to help you.,Kevin
Okay.,Michael
"[at the skating rink]Hey, uh. It's just you. Anything you want to hear?",DJ
Um... Dave Matthews Band. No hits! Deep tracks only.,Andy
Okay. [Ants Go Marching starts playing],DJ
I said no hits!,Andy
"I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not...",Ryan
"Hey, Ryan.",Kevin
Yeah.,Ryan
How's your fart project coming?,Kevin
"That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?",Ryan
Me.,Kevin
"Kevin, don't! Come on!",Pam
"Oh, Pam, soda. Caffeine!",Kelly
"Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.",Pam
"[holding a pack of cigarettes] Well, if you don't have to do 'em...",Meredith
"Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!",Kelly
"Okay, no.",Ryan
My resolution was to get more attention.,Kelly
"No, she's lying.",Ryan
"Hey, Ryan. [taps board, makes farting noise]",Kevin
"One, two, three. [does cartwheel] I did it! I did a cartwheel!",Erin
[bleep] you! [bleep] you! God!,Creed
"Okay, that's it.",Pam
[throws resolution board away in dumpster] Lesson learned.,Pam
Sup?,Darryl
Hey! Where did you go?,Andy
To the arcade.,Darryl
"Oh, cool.",Andy
"Why, did you meet someone?",Darryl
"Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him.",Andy
"Right on, son.",Darryl
Gentlemen.,Dwight
And where did you go?,Andy
Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.,Dwight
Right.,Darryl
"So, that's it, guys? If you want, I can put on the strobe.",DJ
Yeah!,Dwight
You want to keep this?,Erin
No.,Michael
Do you want to keep this?,Erin
Yup.,Michael
Do you want to keep this?,Erin
You can toss them.,Michael
My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully.,Michael
We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine...,Holly
"I just think we need to cool things down for awhile. Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I'm sure.",Holly
Look at where you're going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where you're going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot.,Michael
Mmmhm.,Creed
You ready to do this?,Michael
"Yes, sir.",Creed
You know what? I'm going to stay here as long as it takes.,Michael
"I really appreciate it, Boss.",Creed
It's about you. It's about you. Go!,Michael
I did it!,Creed
You did?,Michael
The perfect cartwheel.,Creed
Okay.,Michael
What a rush! That's all I had to do all year.,Creed
"Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow.",Michael
"Oh, sorry, mate.",David Brent
"[English accent] Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate.",Michael
[laughing] What you doing?,David
English?,Michael
"You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that.",David
"Oh no no, I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct?",Michael
"Yeah big time, yeah.",David
I'm working on an English character. Would you mind gi... It's called Reginald Pooftah.,Michael
"Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you?",David
Michael Scott.,Michael
"Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He's called Ho Li [bleep]. That's what it sounds like.",David
[laughing],Michael
Herrow! Herrow!,David
I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping!,Michael
You can't do that these days. You can't.,David
"No, no, no. And people don't understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality.",Michael
"No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That's what she said. [laughs]. [hugs Michaels] Ohh.",David
That's good. Pleasure to meet you.,Michael
Where are you working?,David
Dunder Mifflin.,Michael
Any jobs now?,David
"No, not right now.",Michael
Just let me know.,David
All right. See you around.,Michael
All right.,David
Bye-bye. What a nice guy.,Michael
"Your first student is here, Mister Bernard.",Erin
That's actually 'Master of Ceremonies' Bernard.,Andy
"Last year, I went to a seminar called 'The Ten Secrets of Real Estate'. Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients.",Andy
Oh it's... [points to conference room],Erin
"[enters] [in a gruff voice] Hello, I am here for the small business seminar.",Michael
Michael?,Erin
Nein! I'm greek! My name is Mikanos.,Michael
"Ooh. Wait, Michael?",Erin
Okay.,Michael
"I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character 'Mikanos', is just a little added flava. 'Mikanos' is loosely based on another character I do, 'Spiros', who is more about the ladies.",Michael
Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best.,Andy
"Listen, this isn't a favor, all right? This is a good idea. We all win.",Jim
Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous.,Andy
"Wow. [sees guy at Erin's desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.",Jim
"No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy,",Andy
I know.,Jim
"If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night.",Andy
I'm really sorry. I can't do it.,Jim
You can't. You can't.,Andy
"I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at.",Andy
Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?,Jim
What's going on? Do you know that guy?,Pam
"I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.",Jim
Hey.,Dwight
Hey.,Jim
[to Erin] How are the marks?,Dwight
What are some of your small business ideas?,Dwight
I was thinking we could buy up of abandoned mine shafts.,Older guy
Oooh!,"Phyllis, Stanley, Dwight"
"That's great. There's a big, big future in that.",Dwight
A lot of mines in Scranton.,Phyllis
"Um, what about you?",Dwight
"Uh, credit cards.",Younger Guy
Uh-huh.,Dwight
"My company would act as an intermedium, for like, point two cents off every transaction.",Younger Guy
Wow!,Dwight
"Something with cell phones. It's like, every time you make a phone call I'd make point two cents. Or anything like any on-line shopping I would get point two cents.",Younger Guy
Right. Okay? Great.,Dwight
Great.,Stanley
You promised us whales. These are worms.,Dwight
"They're not worms, Dwight, okay? They're just people with tiny businesses. They're baby whales which is even cuter.",Andy
I'm out.,Stanley
"Stanley, you're suppose to close.",Andy
I'm out too.,Phyllis
What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team.,Andy
We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.,Dwight
"You know what might be kind of fun? I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and...",Michael
"Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that.",Holly
Okay.,Michael
"Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me. To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That's what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it.",Michael
"[as Mikanos] If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to Mikanos?",Michael
Is Mikanos greek? He sounds Italian.,Holly
Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today.,Michael
Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus.,Holly
"Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that.",Michael
[muttering] Down... there. [to Pam] Is 'jlp' a word?,Erin
Jelp?' J-e-l-p?,Pam
"No, j-l-p. Like, 'I jlp... I jlp you!'",Erin
I don't think that's a word.,Pam
"I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game.",Erin
"The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen 'The Shining', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Ring'. Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.",Erin
You want some help?,Pam
Really?,Erin
Mm-hmm.,Pam
Yes.,Erin
K-a. 'Ka'? What does 'ka' mean?,Pam
It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play 'moo'?,Oscar
"Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing 'moo', I'm playing 'milk'. Whatever it takes.",Erin
"Okay, but look, you could have hit 'mood'. Would have played a...",Oscar
Uh...,Erin
A triple word.,Oscar
Like the cow mood yesterday. God.,Erin
Or moon.,Oscar
The cow jumped over the moon.,Erin
She's stuck on that one thing.,Oscar
"No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right?",Pam
"Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I'm just... I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy.",Andy
"Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.",Kevin
"Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great.",Andy
Then I won't let you down.,Kevin
Cake.,Kelly
In you go.,Ryan
"Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right?",Andy
Yup.,Ryan
I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business.,Andy
And?,Ryan
Can you do it?,Andy
Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.,Ryan
So no?,Andy
"No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment.",Ryan
"Oh, baby.",Kelly
"What do I put you down for, bro hombre?",Andy
Yes.,Ryan
All right!,Andy
"Yes, I'll do it.",Ryan
"Okay, than you so much. It's going to be so awesome.",Andy
"And if I flake, I flake.",Ryan
What?,Andy
"Kevin, you open it up.",Andy
Yep.,Kevin
"Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then Creed: guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two three!",Andy
Go.,Kevin
Creed! Ha!,Creed
Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog.,Andy
Hi Nard Dog. I'm Lu Peachem.,Older Woman
"Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, 'Don't Just Dream it, do it.' Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone. [plays Ozzy Osboure's Crazy Train]",Andy
[running laps around the conference room] Yes!,Kevin
There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.,Kevin
[out of breath] Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an. [coughing] And then double it! [coughing].,Kevin
Are you okay?,Andy
No. Yes!,Kevin
Here...,Andy
"No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. [coughing] [vomiting]. Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way! [runs out of room]",Kevin
I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last...,Andy
"But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.",Kelly
What are you...,Andy
"Who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.",Kelly
"It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. 'The Business Bitch', 'The Diet Bitch', 'The Shopping Bitch', 'The Etiquette Bitch.'",Kelly
"I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing.",Kelly
"Hey, Kelly Kapoor. What a delicious surprise.",Professor Powell
"Profess Powell, you are on speakerphone.",Kelly
"Uh, why?",Professor Powell
Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?,Kelly
"Um, there aren't really ten secrets.",Professor Powell
"Come on Scott, please? It's me.",Kelly
"Um, all right. Well, um, I guess know your market would be key. Practice fiscal discipline.",Professor Powell
Mm-hmm.,Kelly
That brilliant little bitch.,Andy
A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that 'q' right there.,Oscar
Wait. Why?,Erin
"Put the 'q' there, sweetie.",Oscar
I think there's better...,Pam
Put the 'q' there! [phone rings] Sorry I yelled.,Oscar
You could have just told us what you were thinking.,Pam
There's no theater in that.,Oscar
"There's no yelling in that, either.",Pam
Well...,Oscar
What do you do in your free time?,Holly
[as Mikanos] Practice Olympics.,Michael
Mmm. Do you like movies?,Holly
"[as Mikanos] I like the musical 'Grease', or as we call it, 'home'.",Michael
We have to try this out on somebody.,Holly
[as Mikanos] Hello.,Michael
"Look, you want to order something?",Hank
She will have a greekaccino.,Michael
I don't know what that is.,Hank
It...,Michael
[with accent] It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat.,Holly
[laughs] I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk!,Michael
No more brain damage.,Holly
No more brain damage!,Michael
Ahh!,Holly
I don't know.,Holly
"Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is... Creed Bratton. [applause]",Andy
"Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a penis. I have just described to you the Loch Ness Monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one question: Why are you here?",Creed
"[clapping] Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour.",Andy
I picked out our movie. It's called 'Suspiria'. It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down.,Gabe
When I win...,Erin
Ooh.,Gabe
"We're gonna watch 'Wall-e', where all the boundaries of color are pushed.",Erin
"It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some 'Slumdog Millionaire' scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible.",Gabe
So what's your crazy business pipe dream?,Dwight
"Well, I started my own golf supply company.",Guy
[unimpressed] Really?,Dwight
"It's taken off faster than I expected, so I came here to learn about creating manageable growth.",Guy
[quietly] Phyllis?,Dwight
Hmm?,Phyllis
Some of these people are for real.,Dwight
"Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.",Dwight
Thank you.,Andy
"Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?",Dwight
Really?,Andy
Ahem!,Darryl
Excuse me.,Andy
I got it. I got it.,Dwight
"[turning towards Darryl] Hey, do you need a lozenge?",Andy
[whispering] They're a bunch of jackals.,Darryl
What?,Andy
"They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home.",Darryl
"[to Dwight, Stanley, and Phyllis]: Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture.",Andy
"Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. [to Michael and Holly] Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on?",Andy
[whispering] You're gonna blow it.,Dwight
Maybe. Only maybe.,Andy
We got it! Wow! We got it!,Oscar
"Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself.",Pam
"Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes.",Oscar
Yes.,Erin
"[pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have 'apoplexy' if you lose. Do you understand? 'Apoplexy' is what I will have.",Oscar
Apoplexy.,Erin
Yes.,Oscar
"Got it. [plays word] Oh, Oscar. Oscar?",Erin
I played 'ape.',Erin
[on phone] I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.,Jim
"Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so...",Andy
"[as Mikanos] Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. I'm going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since it's a secret, and I'll tell you. [exits conference room] [normal voice] All, you have to close right now.",Michael
"Yeah, I mean, I'm getting to it.",Andy
"No, you're not. You're getting past it. You have to close. You can do it.",Michael
"Yeah, yeah.",Andy
"Andy, what's the problem?",Michael
This is hard for me. I'm a nice guy.,Andy
"You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don't let them down. Don't let yourself down, Andy. I'm gonna go back in. I'm going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close. [entering conference room] [as Mikanos] What is taking that guy so long?",Michael
Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?,Jim
I don't know. They're still in there.,Pam
Ohh! Good-bye.,Jim
Stop. Out with it.,Pam
"Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom.",Pam
"Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.",Jim
"And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group.",Pam
"I was blue group, so it was second from the top.",Jim
And Tom...,Pam
Was in the green group.,Jim
"And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.",Pam
And that's what I told him.,Jim
Right. But how'd you say it?,Pam
My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with.',Jim
"Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that's gonna be different is you'll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who's gonna buy one right now?",Andy
I'll take one.,Older Woman
"Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? [younger guy raises hand] Sold! Anybody else? [older guy raises hand] Yes! All right!",Andy
Yeah bitch.,Kelly
Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life.,Andy
"[quietly] No, no, no.",Michael
"But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime.",Andy
Whoo!,Kelly
"Hey, you think it's cool if I grab a soda?",Tom
"Yeah, woah. [deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead.",Jim
Hey.,Tom
Hey.,Jim
How's it goin'?,Tom
Pretty good.,Jim
It's been a while.,Tom
"It has been, yeah.",Jim
"So you work here, huh?",Tom
Sales.,Jim
Must be a front for some kind of famous laboratory. [laughs],Tom
[laughs],Jim
Cause you're so smart.,Tom
"Oh, man. You remember that, huh?",Jim
"Oh, barely. I'm so dumb, you know, stuff goes in, stuff goes out. Not like you probably remember every paper sale you ever made. Paper salesman genius.",Tom
"All right, good catch-up.",Jim
Yeah.,Tom
See ya.,Jim
"Where's your jetpack, Zuckerberg?",Tom
Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya.,Dwight
"Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They're on the outside. Don't how you missed 'em.",Andy
[with accent] Wonderful seminar!,Holly
"[as Mikanos] Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on.",Michael
"Michael, I should get back to work.",Holly
What? Come on. It's time for grapes. [regular voice] Real fun day.,Michael
"So, I won.",Gabe
I know. You get to pick.,Erin
"Well, that's actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch 'Wall-e'.",Gabe
Yes?,Erin
"So I got us a compromise. This movie's called 'Hardware'. It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It's some of what you like and some of what I like, and... married...",Gabe
"Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you'd really like it.",Andy
There's a 'Shrek' two?!,Erin
"Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow.",Andy
Nice guy.,Gabe
Ohh. [laughs],Erin
"Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement.",Kelly
Oh my gosh!,Erin
Wow.,Phyllis
"Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced. [throws ring on the ground]",Kelly
Sweet! Free Ring!,Meredith
Divorced?,Andy
"Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.",Ryan
The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.,Kelly
Wait. Can you back up? What's the story?,Pam
"We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot.",Kelly
It's not irrelevant. Details,Ryan
"And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...",Kelly
I don't think I should be married to you anymore.,Ryan and Kelly
What?,Kevin
"Sorry, when did you get married?",Andy
"Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right.",Kelly
And you didn't invite any of us?,Andy
"We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.",Ryan
"God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake.",Kelly
"No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married.",Ryan
"You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married.",Oscar
"No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can!",Ryan
"Ryan, I changed my mind.",Kelly
"Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?",Ryan
And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand],Kelly
All right. Bye.,Jim
Bye.,Pam
Let's Go!,Jim
Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?,Michael
For what?,Holly
You broke up with AJ weeks ago.,Michael
Don't you have a sales call to go on?,Holly
"I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?",Michael
We don't know that.,Holly
Sure we do.,Michael
Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?,Holly
Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.,Michael
"Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I'm working with. Well, you can understand that.",Holly
"Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree.",Michael
Well you don't have to agree.,Holly
Yes I do.,Michael
No you don't.,Holly
Yes I do.,Michael
"No, you can have your own opinion.",Holly
I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.,Michael
He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.,Jim
Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny 'Jim' game.,Pam
That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?,Jim
"All right, what'd you do?",Pam
"Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.",Jim
Where'd you put it?,Pam
Where'd I put what?,Jim
Let's go.,Michael
"Oh, sorry gotta go.",Jim
Say it. Where?,Pam
"Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer.",Jim
The fridge.,Pam
"Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.",Jim
"The fridge, got it.",Pam
And the final clue...,Jim
Let's go!,Michael
"You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine.",Jim
Bye.,Pam
Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.,Erin
Cheer up. We made a sale.,Jim
Just drive faster. I want to get back.,Michael
"Well, I'm going the speed limit. So...",Jim
"Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit.",Michael
Someone's in a bad mood.,Jim
"No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is sex different after the baby, Jim?",Michael
"Alright, let me turn on some music.",Jim
I need to pee.,Michael
No you don't.,Jim
"Yeah, I do. My word against yours.",Michael
Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.,Jim
What part of 'I need to pee' do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.,Michael
"Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.",Jim
Well I hope I make it.,Michael
Hello?,Jim
"Hi Jim, it's Helen.",Helen
Hey Helen. Is everything ok?,Jim
Everything is fine. Baby's fine. She has a tiny fever. I'm taking her for a check up. Nothing to worry about.,Helen
Ok...,Jim
A tiny thing. I locked her in the car.,Helen
What?,Jim
She's smiling. She's happy.,Helen
Oh my God.,Jim
"Jim, I don't have a spare key.",Helen
"Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?",Jim
[towards bathroom] Hello? [gives up and drives off],Guy
This is Pam.,Pam
"Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok.",Jim
What's wrong?,Pam
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?,Jim
"Jim, what?",Pam
"Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.",Jim
Oh God! What?!,Pam
"No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.",Jim
Ok. She's ok?,Pam
"Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.",Jim
Understood.,Pam
And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.,Jim
Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a 'Ask Pam Beasley'. ... Did the phone cut off?,Pam
Nope.,Jim
"Alright, just call me after the doctor.",Pam
Ok. Bye.,Jim
Bye.,Pam
"I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isn't here and I am worried that he has been abducted.",Michael
"No, he ditched you man. I saw him drive away.",Attendant
There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. He's my... Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please!,Michael
Just make it quick.,Attendant
"Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick. [opens phone] And you don't have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?",Michael
You don't know it.,Attendant
"You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim's number.",Michael
He left you here on purpose. All right? I saw it. He just drove away.,Attendant
"Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good. [to cameras] Nope, get away. No, that's enough. Ok.",Michael
It's the gas station on Benet Street?,Holly
Yeah.,Pam
Ok.,Holly
You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?,Erin
Oh no no no. I'll be fine.,Holly
It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.,Erin
"Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.",Dwight
"Cute. [enters office area] Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good.",Pam
Which on in particular?,Oscar
"Yeah, which one?",Andy
Well the first one has a surprise factor. 'I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!',Pam
Boo-yea! [office laughs],Andy
No no. No no no.,Gabe
"But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.",Pam
You suppose?,Oscar
What's it say?,Darryl
"I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.'",Oscar
Ok. [office laughs] No no no.,Gabe
Red gloves.,Kevin
Keep it real.,Darrly
"You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.",Pam
And I will take you all down.,Darryl
You?,Andy
I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason: me.,Darryl
Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.,Andy
"Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.",Pam
Woo-hoo.,Andy
I can't wait.,Kevin
Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type: marsupial.,Dwight
He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.,Erin
"Yeah, he just left.",Attendant
Which way did he go?,Holly
"Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.",Dwight
Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?,Holly
She's right. He went that way.,Attendant
Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker. [Dwight and Erin low-five] Let's ride.,Dwight
[at puppies] Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don't get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute. [at parrots] Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You're so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That's a metaphor I guess. [at snake] You are disgusting. You'll never find love. Yekkk. [holding puppy] Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen? [licks his nose] I'm being serious. Seriously.,Michael
"[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",Pam
Has Michael checked in?,Dwight
"Oh, hey Dwight.",Pam
I asked you a question.,Dwight
"No, he hasn't.",Pam
Goodbye.,Dwight
"No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...",Pam
"Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.",Dwight
No.,Erin
This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.,Dwight
"Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out...",Pam
"Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.",Dwight
"Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up]",Pam
No word from Michael.,Dwight
Oh.,Holly
Ta-da!,Pam
"Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island.",Kevin
Ok. I got one.,Oscar
Yeah?,Pam
Yes!,Oscar
"Ok, I'm sorry but I am going to have to shut this down.",Gabe
Boo!,Office
Why?,Meredith
Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It's either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed.,Gabe
"Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.",Darryl
"Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for.",Gabe
Irony is such a critical...,Oscar
Number two: no pop culture references.,Gabe
Seriously?,Pam
Wow.,Oscar
"I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference, making them feel like the other.",Gabe
"Wrap it up, Gabe.",Darryl
"Ok final thing, and this is a fun one: Instead of writing the caption directly under the picture, let's all try using Sticky Quips. All right? New, from Dunder Mifflin Sabre.",Gabe
Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. [laughs] Not every day.,Gabe
Go get 'em. Start quipin'.,Gabe
"Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM.",Oscar
Oh! Ok.,Pam
Send me one too.,Darryl
"Yeah, yeah. Put me on that.",Andy
C.C,Phyllis
Ditto.,Kevin
"Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I don't have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog.",Michael
I'm not a pawn shop.,Hot Dog Guy
Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.,Michael
Wow.,Hot Dog Guy
With that I can buy... half the menu.,Michael
I can't just go giving away hot dogs.,Hot Dog Guy
All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?,Michael
Throw 'em away.,Hot Dog Guy
"Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don't you just throw one away now into my mouth?",Michael
No.,Hot Dog Guy
Okay. You've just lost my business.,Michael
Hey.,Dwight
"Hey, you were in there forever.",Erin
There's too many brands. Where's Holly?,Dwight
She wandered off like an idiot.,Erin
Hey!,Dwight
Hey.,Holly
What are you doing?,Dwight
"Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go. I'll take my free stress ball too now.",Holly
"Sure thing. Here you go, Miss... Okay, Fanny Smellmore. Real original.",Cell Phone Sales Person
What?,Holly
You know what? Say hi to Orville Tootenbacher for me.,Cell Phone Sales Person
Tootenbacher.,Dwight
Orville Tootenbacher. That's Michael's millionaire character that...,Erin
farts popcorn.,Dwight and Erin
"Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?",Dwight
Are their egg rolls really that big?,Holly
"Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it?",Michael
No problem.,Waiter
Okay. I'll be right back. [goes to leave but walks back]. Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can't do that to you fine people.,Michael
So you can't pay for your food?,Waiter
"Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.",Michael
You did not. You have no money. And you dined so much.,Waiter
Well the number three is not such a giant feast.,Michael
[calling to the back] Mr. Chu!,Waiter
"Okay, all right. You know what?",Micahel
You were trying to steal food from us?,Waiter
I am not. I just have had a bad day. And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now.,Michael
You can't. We'll stop you.,Waiter
"Well, I think I can get through the door.",Michael
"Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian...",Dwight
[point to picture] It's Michael!,Erin
He just left.,Waiter
You knew.,Erin
What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?,Holly
"Uncanny. Put a pin in that. [to waiter] Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. [pointing] This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?",Dwight
I think he was heading downtown.,Waiter
He's heading downtown.,Dwight
"So what, no one's even gonna try?",Gabe
Guess not.,Pam
"Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive.",Gabe
"You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people. [notification tone] [laughter]",Darryl
Hey...,Gabe
[whispers] Click the 'x',Stanley
[whispers] I'm clicking!,Phyllis
In the box.,Stanley
I am clicking.,Phyllis
"Woman, you've had a computer for years!",Stanley
Phyllis!,Andy
Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I'll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don't want to be your babysitter.,Gabe
Oooohhh.,Andy
Darn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat.' [laughter],Gabe
Nice!,Kevin
"No, not nice. Terrible. Doesn't even include the fact that they're dogs.",Gabe
Do the next one.,Andy
"Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you're dreaming you're a dog on a desert island.'",Gabe
Dreaming he's a dog on a island.,Darryl
"Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?",Gabe
"Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?",Phyllis
"Umm... 'You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I'm the only one here.' Ha.",Gabe
"That's tasteless, Gabe.",Oscar
Tasteless?,Gabe
Tasteless.,Oscar
"More tasteless than this...'is that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, let's pee on it.' [laughter]",Gabe
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.",Pam
Yes.,Phyllis
"Yes, well done!",Kevin
Who's is it? Who wrote that?,Oscar
"Yeah, who wrote it?",Phyllis
Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.,Angela
"Where did he go, Holly?",Erin
I have no idea.,Holly
"Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, 'this way, this way'?",Dwight
I don't know.,Holly
"Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!",Dwight
"Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all.",Holly
All right then. Someone propose a plan.,Dwight
Okay. We fan out...,Erin
"Not you, Erin.",Dwight
"Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below.",Holly
That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.,Dwight
"Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him.",Holly
Good. We don't need her.,Erin
"Right. I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination. Maybe he's bowling.",Dwight
[walks to the roof of a building and spots Michael] Michael?,Holly
Hi. [laughs] How did you know I was up here?,Michael
What are you doing up here?,Holly
I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.,Michael
Dunder Mifflin.,Holly
Yeah. [laughs] Wow. I just miss you so much.,Michael
I missed you too.,Holly
Really?,Michael
Yeah.,Holly
Can I kiss you?,Michael
Yeah.,Holly
Okay.,Michael
Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.,Phyllis
"Uh, it was.",Gabe
Maybe it wasn't.,Meredith
"Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe.'",Gabe
Oh! [laughter],Andy
"No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.",Phyllis
"I know what it smells like but I didn't roll in anything. It's from listening to all of Gabe's bull[bleep]. [laughter] 'Isn't this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I'm Gabe and I'm a weirdo.'",Gabe
[laughs],Andy
"Gabe's mom... hmm... Gabe's mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her.'",Gabe
"Yeah, there you go. [laughter]",Phyllis
Hey. How you doing?,Pam
Thinking about my grandmother a lot.,Darryl
Yeah.,Pam
She was about to turn 97.,Darryl
"At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.",Pam
"Thank you. 'Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted.' 'Have fun today, big guy.' 'Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop.'",Darryl
It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday.,Pam
Hooray. Live it up big D. ' 'Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this'?,Darryl
Birthday punches! [softly punching Darryl in the stomach] One two three four five sice seven eight!,Andy
I'm so sorry.,Pam
[tears welling up in his eyes],Darryl
...thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!...,Andy
...So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I'm taking Rachel. She's picking me up after work.,Andy
Rachel from the party?,Darryl
"Oh, yeah!",Andy
Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow! [they fist bump and explode],Darryl
"Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene.",Phyllis
"Okay, bye. Okay, bye. [kisses Michael] I'll miss you.",Holly
Miss you. Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me.,Michael
Bye.,Holly
"Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye.",Michael
"Okay, one more quick one.",Holly
Don't go. I don't want you to go. Oh don't go. Don't go.,Michael
"Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. [sighs] It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you.",Michael
And what do we have here?,Gabe
From my secret admirer. That's you!,Erin
Come on.,Gabe
I dominate Valentine's Day. I practically make romance into a science.,Gabe
"Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue.' Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt!",Erin
"Oh, close. It's a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck.",Gabe
"But, there's no clue.",Erin
"Well, get to work.",Gabe
"I can't, 'cause there's no clue.",Erin
The puzzle is the clue.,Gabe
Oh.,Erin
[clears throat],Oscar
[rubbing hands with Holly] Are these numbers correct?,Michael
"The numbers are correct, Michael.",Oscar
Okay.,Michael
[clears throat more loudly],Oscar
"Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out.",Michael
I jus... I just need a signature.,Oscar
[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.,Jim
How much did you give him?,Pam
Big tip.,Jim
Wait. I don't have my scarf.,Pam
What?,Jim
I'm missing my scarf. Oh. [both laugh],Pam
We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.,Jim
"[loudly] Yeah, lunch was wonderful!",Pam
Shh.,Jim
"Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?",Pam
"Um, bottomless champagne.",Jim
"Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?",Pam
No.,Jim
Psst! Psst!,Erin
What's up?,Andy
Are you good at jigsaw puzzles?,Erin
Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.,Andy
Okay.,Erin
"But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably...",Andy
"Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.",Erin
"Well, okay then.",Andy
Yes!,Erin
At least until Stanley calms down.,Andy
"Oh, is he...",Erin
D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy],Andy
Andy.,Erin
"[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]",Jim
"Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat]",Dwight
[goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.,Jim
You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.,Dwight
"Aww, nuts. [laughs]",Jim
"I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA.",Angela
Yes! The freaking PDA!,Oscar
Uh-huh.,Angela
"Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them.",Oscar
No one is more thrilled for them than I am...,Angela
"Yes, yes, absolutely.",Oscar
...but it's totally inappropriate.,Angela
"Yeah, it's a little much.",Darryl
Mm-hmm.,Phyllis
"Obviously, so happy for them both.",Darryl
So happy. Yeah.,Oscar
"I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...",Kevin
"No, stop! Just don't.",Angela
Kevin!,Oscar
Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.,Kevin
[groans],Everyone
God! Kevin!,Angela
So tell me about your new girlfriend.,Erin
"She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there.",Andy
"Aww, cute.",Erin
"Hey, look at that. Done.",Andy
That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.,Erin
I wish you well on your quest.,Andy
"No, come on.",Erin
"Aww, I mean...",Andy
[growling] Come on!,Erin
Okay.,Andy
Ha!,Erin
"[to Toby] I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just...[makes popping sound] like it's coming from my own head.",Gabe
"Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly's back]",Michael
Ohh. Can you get lower?,Holly
"Oh, yeah.",Michael
A little lower.,Holly
I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head.,Holly
Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice.,Gabe
[clears throat],Michael
Yes?,Gabe
"[sitting in Holly's lap] Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?",Michael
"Seeing as it's Valentine's Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace.",Gabe
Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on.,Michael
"First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you'd expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances.",Gabe
"Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting.",Ryan
"Uh, I also don't see Andy.",Meredith
Oooh.,Kevin
OOH! Boom! Face!,Jim
"I get it. Andy's slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam.",Gabe
Yeah. What? Us?,Pam
They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife.,Gabe
Did it!,Jim
Yeah!,Pam
Love it. Keep it goin.,Jim
"Okay. So, PDAs. That's gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh...",Gabe
Booby honking.,Kevin
"Yeah, booby honking. Sure.",Gabe
Butt honking.,Kevin
"Butt honking. Yeah, all the honking.",Gabe
"The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap...",Creed
"Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem.",Gabe
Are you guys listening to this?,Oscar
"What, are you talking about me and Holly?",Michael
Yeah!,Pam
Maybe you find your own chair.,Gabe
So we kiss occasionally.,Holly
Not occasionally. All the time.,Oscar
"Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering.",Phyllis
The flirtatious tickling.,Stanley
Whispering and tickling have their place in business.,Michael
That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.,Darryl
"I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.",Michael
Michael. Confession: I have done PDA in the office.,Dwight
Thank you.,Michael
I've had intercourse in the office.,Dwight
All right.,Michael
As has Angela!,Dwight
Dwight!,Angela
As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly.,Dwight
As has Kevin!,Kevin
With who?,Angela
She goes to another school.,Kevin
Okay. Fine. No more PDA.,Michael
Good.,Oscar
You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.,Michael
No.,Angela
Anything goes.,Michael
Just leave it how you said...,Oscar
"Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?",Dwight
"Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?",Michael
And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?,Dwight
Pro.,Michael
Yes!,Dwight
What? Problem solved.,Michael
"No, no, it's great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises.",Michael
"That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right?",Pam
Mm-hmm.,Jim
"You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him.",Pam
[snorts] Ew.,Jim
Don't mind us. You keep working.,Erin
Okay. I'll keep working.,Darryl
"Oh, my God. It's a song.",Erin
Whoa.,Andy
What do you think is on it?,Erin
[softy] We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.,Andy
[softly] Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.,Erin
I think he can hear us.,Andy
"[softly] That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level.",Andy
Darryl.,Erin
Darryl is a jerk.,Andy
"No, he's not.",Erin
"No, I'm just testing if he can hear.",Andy
I can hear you.,Darryl
Oh. Okay.,Andy
Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.,Erin
[Gabe singing] The temp at night. The temp at night. The temp at night. The temp at night.,Boom Box
The temp at night?,Andy
What do you...,Erin
You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.,Darryl
Pi...,Andy
Pick it up.,Darryl
Okay.,Andy
Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.,Darryl
Right. Okay.,Andy
Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things.,Holly
"Ah, the old 'leave behind.' Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working.",Michael
"Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable.",Holly
"Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.",Michael
"Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.",Holly
"Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop.",Michael
Okay.,Holly
Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.,Michael
"Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day.",Michael
Two people in love?,Holly
I love you.,Michael
"Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, 'oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl.' Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?",Holly
I love you-love you.,Michael
"Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you. [both laugh]",Holly
I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. [shakes Holly's hand],Michael
I love you.,Holly
"Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me.",Michael
"Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night?",Andy
I guess we just have to wait until night and see.,Erin
"Oh, or maybe not. [turns out the lights]",Andy
[gasps] Oh. Cool.,Erin
How romantic is this?,Andy
Super romantic.,Erin
Right. Do you see a clue or...,Andy
Yeah. Did you not see it? ['Eat at Hanks' is written in glow-in-the-dark letters above the door],Erin
"Oh, my gosh.",Andy
Hanks.,Erin
Hey!,Jim and Pam
[bursting out of Ryan's closet] Hey.,Andy and Erin
No time to chat.,Andy
Sorry.,Erin
"Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.",Jim
Hey. You're looking for me?,Ryan
"Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.",Pam
No you weren't.,Ryan
"No, we weren't.",Pam
You wanted to have sex in my office.,Ryan
No.,Pam
Definitely not. That's disgusting.,Jim
No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.,Ryan
"Hey, you don't have to...",Jim
That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die.,Pam
That was really rough.,Jim
Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office.,Pam
"No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.",Jim
"Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed.",Pam
And a shower.,Jim
"Hello, Holly.",Michael
Hello.,Holly
"Here, shake. No!",Michael
"No, don't touch.",Holly
"No, we can't.",Michael
No touching.,Holly
"No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you.",Michael
Oh.,Holly
Oh.,Michael
Almost got you.,Holly
"Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh.",Michael
You're not touching me.,Holly
I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it.,Michael
"Okay, this is much worse than before.",Oscar
"Yeah, I agree. This is nasty.",Kevin
Grab you here.,Michael
And here.,Holly
I will grab you here anyway. [laughs],Michael
You have to cut it out.,Gabe
Okay.,Holly
Never.,Michael
You said you would.,Holly
"I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.",Michael
"No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One: You're taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling.",Gabe
"No, I don't think so.",Holly
"Number two: You're desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to Nashua. Or three: You're at an age where your sexual climaxes aren't as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior.",Gabe
"Yes, it was that. It's that one.",Michael
Yes. Number three.,Holly
Give me all your money and take off your clothes.,Holly
We're not supposed to PDA.,Michael
Come one. Nobody's looking. What's wrong?,Holly
I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua.,Michael
Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance.,Holly
That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different?,Michael
We weren't in love last time.,Holly
I was in love with you.,Michael
I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said.,Holly
"[chuckles, sighs]",Michael
"Oh. One Erin Special, please.",Erin
Here's your bottle of sparkling cider.,Hank
Hey.,Andy
[laughs] That's my favorite.,Erin
I'm now supposed to tell you to enjoy a mind-hunt break and look for a heart or some [bleep] in the break room when you're through.,Hank
"[through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy!",Kevin
Make that face he likes.,Darryl
Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him.,Dwight
It's like a time bomb...,Michael
Shh.,Dwight
"...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging.",Michael
Just hush.,Dwight
Sexual time bomb.,Michael
Just rock. Shh.,Dwight
[into recorder] Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.,Michael
Movie idea?,Dwight
No. [into recorder] Saving the world has never been this hard.,Michael
Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.,Dwight
"No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending.",Michael
Kevin! Do more stupid faces.,Dwight
Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.,Kevin
I don't know.,Dwight
Do the monkey face.,Michael
Do the monkey face!,Dwight
I love that. I love that face.,Michael
Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.,Dwight
No. The monkey!,Michael
Go back to the monkey!,Dwight
Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop.,Michael
Hurl your feces.,Dwight
That's good.,Michael
Good.,Dwight
That's good. He's throwing it.,Michael
They really do that.,Dwight
I know.,Michael
[at vending machine] B-9.,Erin
B-9.,Andy
Like a benign tumor.,Erin
"Maybe it's just more like, 'be mine.'",Andy
"Oh, yes. There's a note. 'A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss.'",Erin
Mm.,Andy
Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm [leans in to kiss Andy],Erin
Hmm. [points to Gabe blowing a kiss to Erin],Andy
Holly. Hey.,Michael
Hi.,Holly
"Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up.",Michael
What? What are you talking about?,Holly
"Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow.",Michael
"No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me.",Holly
"You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's...",Michael
What if I said it wasn't up to them?,Holly
Who?,Michael
"The company. Nobody knows our future, but it's not gonna be decided by the company. It's not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me.",Holly
Okay. Okay.,Michael
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay! [claps] Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!",Michael
Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.,Oscar
"Better luck next time, pal.",Kevin
"Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu.",Michael
You do?,Holly
I do.,Michael
Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss],Oscar
"Suck it, Oscar. This must kill you.",Kevin
I just told them to do it!,Oscar
What?,Jim
No.,Pam
No. We took a walk.,Jim
We took a walk.,Pam
"My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.",Dwight
Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.,Ryan
"Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me...",Kelly
"Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.",Kevin
What are our plans for tonight? Umm...,Michael
[imitates a squeaky bed] [laughter],Holly
"After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level: Midnight.",Michael
Erin... what are you doing?,Michael
"Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.",Erin
"That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth.",Michael
Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.,Jim
"We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie.",Pam
"Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!",Jim
"Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. [flashback clip of Michael angrily leaving the conference room while the whole office is laughing at the tv] Everything pointed to it being a comedy.",Pam
We'd love to see it!,Pam
"Sweet, I will go invite Holly.",Michael
"Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?",Pam
Thanks mom.,Creed
You never told me you made a movie.,Holly
"Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom.",Michael
It's got you.,Holly
It's got a lot of me.,Michael
[laughs] I can't wait.,Holly
"Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level: Midnight. [applause]",Michael
"I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.",Dwight
Dwight does not play a robot.,Michael
I gave up a lot of weekends because I thought it'd be good for my daughter to see a black man as president. Even in a silly home movie. What a stupid waste of time.,Daryl
I did not love the dialogue. Or the character. I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.,Jim
He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?,Dwight
"He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him.",Jan
"By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.",Michael
That was not scripted.,Michael
"Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?",Karen
"[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.",Jim
"[turns off the movie from the remote, the office complains]",Michael
"I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.",Jim
Yeah Michael the movie is amazing!,Kelly
It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.,Kevin
You should enter it in festivals!,Ryan
Or carnivals!,Kevin
"[to Holly] Well that's a... pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?",Michael
Uh... which part?,Holly
"Okay. [Stands up and leaves the conference room to the dismay of the office] No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough...",Michael
Some people are really popping on screen!,Andy
Hey.,Michael
Hey! Good movie.,Holly
"Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!",Michael
I loved it.,Holly
Did you? What did you love about it?,Michael
"Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?",Holly
"No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly.",Michael
Uhm...,Holly
"Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.",Michael
Not worried about that.,Holly
"[angrily] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream.",Michael
Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!,Holly
"I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.",Michael
Well why do you have to make a movie at all?,Holly
"Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.",Michael
"Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have?",Holly
"I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.",Michael
I'm real.,Holly
"Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you.",Michael
I love you too.,Holly
"I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films. Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans.",Michael
Who likes Threat Level: Midnight? [applause from the office] Okay then who wants to watch the rest?! [everyone yells approval],Michael
"We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.",Michael
"[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!",Jim
"No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they [chuckles], they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there. [Michael stands up, clearly realizing that his movie is not as great as he thought]",Michael
Hey...,Michael
"Hey, I'm sorry. It is good.",Holly
"No it's not. [kisses Holly while smiling] It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.",Michael
[laughs at the stupidity],Michael
"Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.",Michael
[the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?,Andy
Oh yeah! [laughs] Yes he is!,Michael
"No no, he's doing it to catch the president!",Dwight
"No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid. [the office laughs]",Michael
I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.,Dwight
You're eating eight year old tomatoes?,Kevin
They're still good for another week.,Dwight
"You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles]",Meredith
I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh],Kevin
"Hardy har har. Okay picture this: Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?",Dwight
"Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.",Jim
"No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.",Dwight
Three months.,Jim
Could be.,Dwight
Four months.,Jim
"I can see that happening, yes.",Dwight
Eight months?,Jim
That's a realistic time line.,Dwight
[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.,Jim
Perhaps.,Dwight
Okay now really think hard about this one: One year.,Jim
I can see that as a very real possibility.,Dwight
"[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?",Jim
I can see that happening.,Dwight
Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...,Jim
I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses.,Todd
Still not seeing the problem here.,Michael
"All right, truth is I gotta couple love bumps on my ding-dong so, game-over!",Todd
"It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.",Michael
[walks into conference room with Michael and Todd] Hi!,Holly
Hi. [Holly and Michael kiss],Michael
You must be Todd.,Holly
"[shaking Holly's hand] Whoa! I'm sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston!",Todd
[laughs oddly] Very funny. Okay let's get started.,Holly
After you!,Todd
"Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.",Michael
"Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots.",Michael
All right.,Holly
And it also helps if you've had five shots.,Michael
I already have.,Holly
Whoa!,Michael
[to Michael] Why is Packer back?,Jim
Is Packer here?,Michael
Why's he talking to Holly?,Dwight
"[peering into conference room] Don't know, don't care.",Michael
"[to Todd] Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.",Holly
[excitedly] Oh!,Todd
"[sees Holly and Todd shaking hands in the conference room] Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.",Michael
Yes!,Kevin
What!?,Jim
"It's great to be among friends, but until then, you suckers will do!",Todd
Nice! We got burned!,Kevin
"You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.",Michael
"[seething] Holly, you approved this?",Dwight
"Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff.",Holly
You did approve it?,Jim
Yeah.,Holly
What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.,Kevin
I have very little patience for stupidity.,Kevin
[walking in with Gabe behind her] Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.,Erin
I'm such a klutz!,Gabe
"Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. [realizing there's a new computer at her desk. Gets very excited] Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!",Erin
"I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?",Pam
Thank you Pam.,Erin
"Awwh, you're welcome. [they hug] My pleasure.",Pam
"[Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?",Jim
I just helped someone out. It feels good.,Pam
"Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...",Jim
So you know the feeling.,Pam
Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.,Michael
I didn't order anything.,Dwight
And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.,Michael
Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.,Dwight
"So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. [Jim looks appalled]",Michael
"Thanks man, it'd mean a lot.",Todd
"I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.",Dwight
well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name's carved under the desk.,Todd
No it is not.,Dwight
Is too!,Todd
[Grunting as he crawls under Dwight's desk. Dwight follows] Let's look at this.,Michael
Check it out!,Todd
I don't wanna move desks!,Dwight
Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.,Michael
Do I have any say in this?!,Jim
No!,Michael
"[grunting while humping Michael and Dwight] Don't even watch, Halpert!",Todd
"[in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this?",Dwight
"Oh, that's our Zen garden.",Holly
"What do you grow in here, bullcrap? [puts the tray into the garbage]",Dwight
"[walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um...",Pam
"Hey, what's up guys?",Holly
"Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!",Meredith
"Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?",Jim
Uhm.,Holly
He's seriously awful!,Pam
"Michael's recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me!",Holly
That's how he gets you to take off his panties.,Meredith
[Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?,Jim
United front...,Pam
"Okay, look. We can't fire someone because we don't like him.",Holly
Right this isn't the U.S. Government.,Ryan
What are you referencing?,Kelly
[seems unsure] Everything... Everything.,Ryan
Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done?,Holly
"Well, I mean he humped Michael.",Jim
"Well if that's the case, I guess I've gotta be fired too. [all groan in disgust]",Holly
"[looking at his computer, gasps] Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around! [no one moves] Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach. [watching a sailing video on his computer] They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh. [computer is frozen, taps the top of it] This computer's a hunk of jjunk.",Andy
Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! [pats her new computer],Erin
Where did you get this?!,Andy
Pam gave it to me!,Erin
"This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! [to Pam, in a fake British accent] Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?",Andy
You have a computer Andy.,Pam
"Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So...",Andy
"Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.",Pam
"Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but...",Andy
"Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.",Pam
So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?,Stanley
"I'm not asking for one, I need it.",Andy
"If you're just handing them out, I want one too.",Phyllis
"Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.",Andy
"See, this is what I'm talking about.",Pam
What are you gonna play mange on faster?,Andy
Sorry Andy.,Pam
"Hey what's going on you guys? [walking into the kitchen with Holly, Dwight, and Kevin, with whom he fist bumps] Yeahh! Three muska-queers!",Todd
[giggling] Mean but good!,Kevin
"So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.",Holly
"I don't know, I love her and all, but she turned into a bitch. Mostly she's great, but some days she acts like her mom. [Holly is un-amused]",Todd
"Well, some girls go through a phase.",Holly
"Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!",Kevin
Since when did you learn how to read?,Todd
I do know how to read though!,Kevin
Yeah. You know how to read... a menu!,Todd
"[Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.",Kevin
"Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.",Dwight
"[walking through the office, notices Andy with Erin's computer set up at his desk] What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!",Pam
"It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.",Andy
What? Erin is that true?,Pam
"[nods] I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.",Erin
"Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away.",Pam
"Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and-",Andy
"I'm not freaking out, Andy.",Pam
"-take a few breaths, and then I ask myself: Is this worth freaking out about?",Andy
"Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?",Pam
That's interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.,Andy
Switch the computers back Andy.,Pam
Seriously?,Andy
Seriously.,Pam
Pam! Come on!,Andy
Now please.,Pam
Fine! [the office goes back to their work] Please make sure no one is humping me!,Andy
"[to Holly who is walking by] Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. [picks up an ant farm and tube of ants from her desk, Holly takes them] Thanks.",Erin
Best day ever. Best day ever!,Michael
So much happening. [not as excited as Michael],Holly
"Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?",Michael
No! No.,Holly
Please.,Michael
Did Todd tell you to do that?,Holly
"Yeah, You love him right? [Holly seems unsure] You love him. I can tell.",Michael
I love you.,Holly
"No. Not me, him.",Michael
That's certainly opinionated.,Holly
[looking anxious] If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.,Erin
Oh I'm going.,Holly
"Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey...",Michael
I don't think he's funnier than me.,Holly
He's funnier than me.,Michael
"No, he's not funny at all.",Holly
So I'm less funny than not funny at all?,Michael
[very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!,Erin
"No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is.",Holly
[seems taken aback] Uhm...,Michael
"Ok: Bill Cosby [puts the ant tube high up. Each time she mentions a name it gets lower], Steve Martin, Charlie Bit My Finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here [tube takes a jump to the bottom] Todd Packer.",Holly
That's insane!,Michael
"Honey, he's a jerk.",Holly
"[getting up and walking towards them, worriedly] For Pete's sake it just needs to be done! [takes the ant farm and tube from Holly and heads towards the annex]",Erin
"[to Jim] So you two are married to each other now, right?",Todd
Yeah.,Jim
That's sweet. How's the sex?,Todd
[continues working],Jim
"[walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.",Dwight
Why?,Todd
Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.,Dwight
That's a lot of reasons! [suspicious],Jim
Drink it!,Dwight
I think I'll pass. The only hot chocolate I'm into is Viva A Fox. [winks],Todd
[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?,Jim
"So, this hot chocolate thing.",Jim
None of your business.,Dwight
"Well, you know you can't actually poison him.",Jim
"It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.",Dwight
I really think we should join forces on this one.,Jim
Really.,Dwight
"What do we think, what would drive him crazy.",Jim
I know.,Dwight
Here we go.,Jim
"Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.",Dwight
"You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.",Jim
[mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?,Dwight
"Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.",Jim
Who is Justice Beaver?,Dwight
He... It's a crime fighting beaver.,Jim
Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?,Dwight
"Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.",Jim
"Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.",Dwight
Pam. Can I talk to you in private?,Andy
I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.,Pam
Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.,Andy
[looking confused] You did that?,Pam
Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we're a little late.,Andy
Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-,Pam
"Mind if I close the door? [after shutting door in the conference room] What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.",Andy
"Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?",Pam
You humiliated me in front of every body!,Andy
"Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.",Pam
"I mean, it's pretty broken already.",Andy
"Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.",Pam
[looks at her knowingly] Pretty sneaky sis. [knocking on conference room door],Andy
"[walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]",Ryan
"[to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper]",Dwight
Yeah I couldn't cut it down.,Jim
"They're all good. So good! Number three: eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four: eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-",Dwight
One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?,Jim
"Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.",Dwight
"[Andy is seen clicking random things and warning boxes pop up. He pours coffee on his keyboard, puts bologna with mustard in his CD drive, and many other computer harming things] Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not? [mock baby voice] Oh I hope you don't get sick Mr. Computer. [computer voice] Why are you doing this to me Andy? [normal voice again] Because I hate your programs!",Andy
"[at Hank's with Michael, talking to Hank] And a '76 that's good to boot, I like that. [Hank smiles]",Todd
"And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. [Hank looks irritated again]",Michael
Why?,Todd
"I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.",Michael
Holly said that?,Todd
Yeah.,Michael
She was laughing hysterically that whole time!,Holy
I guess you said something weird about your daughter?,Michael
"She asked me, Michael! It would've been rude not to answer.",Todd
"You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls.",Michael
"Michael, can I open the kamomo with you. I've been on the road too long. But, I wanna connect with my daughter. And it's not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers.",Todd
No it isn't.,Michael
You're right. I gotta watch my behavior.,Todd
"Yeah, a little bit.",Michael
Don't give up on me.,Todd
I won't.,Michael
"[Michael and Todd are walking into the office] Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.",Michael
I got a lot of numbers here to put together.,Kevin
"Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.",Michael
"That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.",Kevin
"Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.",Michael
I'm sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier.,Todd
"Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.",Kevin
"Kevin, do you accept the apology?",Michael
"Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.",Kelly
"Okay, go back to the annex.",Michael
This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.,Kelly
[muttering] Sometimes you over react.,Ryan
"Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.",Oscar
"Okay. You want an apology? Here it goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you are a genius.",Todd
"That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. [Andy looks confused and shrugs] Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-",Michael
[cutting in] No! Don't!,Angela
"I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!",Michael
"[in a car with Andy, by the dumpster you can see a new computer box] So listen, we have to really scuff this up.",Pam
"No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry.",Andy
"Andy, this is the deal we made.",Pam
[watching Pam scrap his computer] That's probably good. That's enough.,Andy
We should break this hinge maybe.,Pam
Let's not go crazy.,Andy
"Well thanks, will do.",Todd
"[using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]",Jim
That sounds weird.,Todd
"It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!",Jim
[also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.,Dwight
[trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!,Jim
Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!,Dwight
"Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, Jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here's the best part. I'm a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every sub species. Also I'm a huge boob nerd.",Todd
Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!,Dwight
What are you doing?,Michael
"[trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]",Jim
"I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why?",Michael
He's a jerk.,Jim
He took my desk.,Dwight
"Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?",Michael
"It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.",Dwight
You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.,Michael
"No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.",Dwight
"He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.",Michael
Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves],Jim
"[plugging in new computer, acting to make people think he got a bad computer] Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?",Andy
Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!,Pam
"Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?",Andy
"Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]",Pam
"All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. [Andy turns it on and looks amazed, clearly happy with it]",Andy
"[walking into Michael's office] You're looking at the new face of corporate. Gonna put the 'ass', in Tallahassee!",Todd
"Yes, about that.",Michael
"Well we gotta go out and celebrate, tonight!",Todd
Well... I don't know if that's a good idea.,Michael
Do you have a ball and chain?,Todd
"No, nothing like that at all.",Michael
"Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. It's your girlfriend, man. She's uptight.",Todd
Sorry?,Michael
"I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, I'll introduce you to all the local [spanks the air] talent.",Todd
[thinks a moment] Sounds great.,Michael
It's gonna be so good.,Todd
That is. [Jim sees them and looks happy] It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there.,Michael
I'm sorry about your friend.,Holly
"Nah, he's an ass.",Michael
[Brooklyn accent] You ahh.,Holly
[imitating] You ahh.,Michael
What ah you wicked smaht?,Holly
No you ahh.,Michael
Who ahh?,Holly
[kisses her and speaks normally again] You ahh.,Michael
So this new computer you found in the warehouse.,Daryl
Yep. Lucked out.,Pam
"Yeah, you really did. 'Cause I know every INCH of that warehouse.",Daryl
"Yep, super lucky.",Pam
Maybe you could go back down there and see if you can find me some extra sick days.,Daryl
"[hesitating at the bribe] Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.",Pam
Really? 'Cause I think maybe I saw five.,Daryl
Three. [Daryl nods],Pam
I'm full on corrupt!,Pam
"Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?",Pam
No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.,Oscar
Oh.,Pam
"Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.",Pam
People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.,Dwight
"Oh, yikes.",Jim
It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.,Pam
It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.,Dwight
The signs will drive people inside.,Pam
The warmth will lure people inside.,Dwight
Close it.,Andy
This is how business...,Dwight
Close it.,Andy
I'm not closing the door.,Dwight
Close it. [starts wrestling Dwight],Andy
Stop it.,Dwight
Just close it.,Andy
"Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?",Dwight
Sure.,Meredith
Not so fast.,Dwight
"Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.",Dwight
I will trade you for the used candle.,Dwight
Forget you.,Meredith
"Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.",Dwight
"Fine, just give it.",Meredith
That's how it's done.,Dwight
"Woah, I love her. How much for that?",Kevin
I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless.,Michael
10 dollars.,Holly
"Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that.",Michael
200,Kevin
500,Michael
20,Holly
45,Kevin
Get lost.,Michael
Damn it.,Kevin
That is how you do it.,Michael
You know we don't have to sell that if you don't want to. If it's a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.,Holly
You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.,Michael
Well we could put it in storage... in case.,Holly
In case... in case of what?,Michael
You know... in case if something changes.,Holly
I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case?,Michael
Nope.,Holly
How much for the slip and slide?,Lady
Get lost.,Michael
"[on phone] Yes, hello Mr. Flax this is Michael Scott, your daughter's boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly because she is such a terrible employee. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm actually calling because I'm in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isn't a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you.",Michael
Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.,Kelly
"Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.",Dwight
Screw you man. People like my stuff.,Kelly
People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.',Dwight
You can take my Helen Fielding collection.,Kelly
And the Jennifer Weiner collection.,Dwight
"Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game?",Andy
Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.,Kevin
Really?,Andy
Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.,Kevin
We should play it.,Darryl
Well... there's no instructions.,Andy
"It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out.",Darryl
Yea.,Kevin
I'm pretty good at board games.,Andy
"Well, shall we make it a little interesting?",Darryl
Sure.,Andy
What is this?,Dwight
How did those get out? I'm sorry.,Jim
Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes?,Dwight
"I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.",Jim
That's a common swindlers trick.,Dwight
"Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.",Jim
So you wanna sell me magic beans. [laughs],Dwight
Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.,Jim
Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.,Dwight
Michael called Dad?,Holly
"Your friend Michael, yes. What's going on?",Holly's Mom
"Um, I think I know. But I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong but is Dad there?",Holly

"Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas.",Michael
Why do you need more gas?,Pam
"Well, I'm writing a message.",Michael
Is it a good message or a bad message?,Pam
I'm asking Holly a question in fire.,Michael
Are you proposing!?,Pam
Maybe.,Michael
Wow.,Pam

"Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.",Pam
I am not in the mood for riddles pam.,Michael
This is terrible.,Pam
"No, this is romantic.",Michael
You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.,Pam
Free sample?,Ryan
"My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.",Ryan
You got this kosher certified?,Dwight
"No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.",Ryan
"Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [laughs]",Dwight
Thank you. Whatcha got there?,Ryan
"Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.",Dwight
things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.,Dwight
"Jim, put those away.",Dwight
[pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.,Jim
"just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?",Dwight
"They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]",Jim
Hey Michael everyone's in the conference room.,Pam
Why?,Michael
You called the meeting I don't..,Pam

We are a family.,Pam
I could not have agreed with you more.,Michael
"And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way.",Pam
Yes. Thank you.,Michael
So about this proposal thing...,Pam
"No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it.",Michael
"Michael, she's perfect for you.",Pam
She's the one.,Oscar
She's amazing. This is very exciting.,Jim
So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.,Pam
I had a great idea until you ruined it.,Michael
"Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.",Oscar
"[playing the Dallas board game] Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card .",Andy
Nice.,Kevin
And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.,Andy
No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.,Kevin
Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.,Andy
And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.,Darryl
Oooh.,Andy
Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.,Darryl
no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.,Kevin
It was in the box.,Darryl
Well played.,Andy
Thank you.,Darryl
We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.,Andy
No but that's not fair.,Kevin
Well that's Dallas.,Andy
Dallas indeed.,Darryl
"What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]",Oscar
My mom also makes the best salsa.,Ryan
This is your moms old stuff?,Holly

How's she doing?,Holly
It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.,Phyllis
How do you know when its time?,Holly
Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.,Phyllis
Let me see.,Holly
Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?,Pam
Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals,Ryan
"How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'",Michael
That's a guarantee.,Jim
"It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.",Michael
Don't think you need the corpse then.,Jim
Heres the ring.,Michael
Holy s*** is that real?,Pam
Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.,Michael
No. [shakes head back and forth],Oscar
Is she not going to like that?,Michael
No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.,Pam
Where was that.,Oscar
At a gas station. [oscar laughs],Jim
At a gas station?,Michael
Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.,Jim
That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.,Michael
No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..,Pam
Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.,Michael
Totally reasonable.,Jim
I just... it's terrifying.,Michael
She's not gonna say no.,Pam
I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.,Michael
Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.,Jim
You were scared?,Pam
Yeah... it.s scary.,Jim
Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie.',Michael
Look I need to talk to you.,Holly
"Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.",Michael
I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.,Holly
Oh ok. For how long?,Michael
I don't know.,Holly
Is he alright?,Michael
Yeah.,Holly
You ok?,Michael
"Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad.",Holly
"Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.",Michael
And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend..,Holly
Ok.,Michael
And I was thinking... you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready... Michael Scott will you..,Holly
"No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.",Michael
"Uh, what?",Holly
No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.,Michael
Hey guys it's my turn.,Kevin
"You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.",Andy
"Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.",Kevin
"I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.",Darryl
This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?,Kevin
Yeah where is it?,Darryl
Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.,Kevin
And that is Dallas. [shows money],Kevin
Nice.,Ryan
Not bad right. [swinging golf club],Jim
Can't really tell the...,Ryan
[to Dwight] Nice.,Jim
I know right...[sees Jim's beans] what the?,Dwight
Oh my God.,Jim
That... that's impossible.,Dwight
"It is right. I mean, it's impossible.",Jim
"All right, I'll take them.",Dwight
They're probably worthless.,Jim
Probably. [walks away with beans],Dwight
Leave the telescope.,Jim
"I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans. So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.",Dwight
"Hey, how'd we do?",Michael
13 dollars.,Holly
That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.,Michael
Listen about earlier ...,Holly
"No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.",Michael
It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.,Holly
Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.,Michael
So this is one of my favorite places in the world.,Michael
Why?,Holly
This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.,Michael
This is where we first kissed.,Michael
I remember.,Holly
And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?,Michael
Michael.. [they both laugh],Holly
"Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes.",Michael
Yes.,Holly
In-grown hair.,Michael
"Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?",Michael
Mh hmm.,Holly
We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump.,Michael
"Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!",Holly
"And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.",Michael
And over here..,Michael
What happened here?,Holly
"Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. [runs water through hand]",Michael
Nice,Holly
Let's go in here.,Michael
[everyone in the office is standing in the kitchen with a lit candle] Hi guys.,Holly
"This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.",Michael
"Holly, will you marry me?",Jim
No.,Holly
Marry me Holly.,Stanley
No.,Holly
That guy's got more than he can handle as it is.,Michael
Will you marry me?,Oscar
No.,Holly
That marriage would be a sham.,Michael
Will you marry me?,Gabe
No.,Holly
Easy no.,Michael
Will you marry me?,Angela
No.,Holly
That would be hot. I would pay to see that.,Michael
Will you marry me Holly?,Ryan
No.,Holly
Only one that I was kind of worried about.,Michael
"[the area where Holly's desk is is filled with lit candles] This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with.. [fire sprinklers go on] Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?",Michael
"Your wife becoming me will I. [everyone in the kitchen starts cheering, then enters annex]",Holly

"Kahlua Sombrero, please.",Michael
"All right, so just you tonight?",Waiter
"Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.",Michael
I'll drink to that. I'm starting at a company this week.,Deangelo
"Oh, really?",Michael
To begginings and endings.,Deangelo
"And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.",Michael
The moms and the troops.,Deangelo
Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday.,Michael
[laughs] I won't... I don't know her.,Deangelo
"I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado.",Michael
Colorado! The sunshine state.,Deangelo
Yep. Don't mess with Colorado.,Michael
Doing some skiing?,Deangelo
"No, no. I don't want to end up like Sunny Bobo.",Michael
Well that's just good sense right there. Everyone I know who skis is dead.,Deangelo
"You know, I would like to try the luge, through.",Michael
"Try it once, you're hooked. That's my guess.",Deangelo
That's what I've heard.,Michael
I'm an olympics nut.,Deangelo
Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?,Michael
[in unison] Summer!,Deangelo/Michael
"[holds out fist] Knuckles! Actually, I gotta come around and give you...",Deangelo
"You know, it's funny, I tried to get an animal olympics going.",Deangelo
Really? What happened?,Michael
"You know, life happened. What are you gonna miss most about Scranton?",Deangelo
Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.,Michael
That's the way it goes.,Deangelo
"Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry. [calls Deangelo, Deangelo's phone vibrates]",Michael
Excuse me. Hello? You running late?,Deangelo
"No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar.",Michael
I'm at the bar too.,Deangelo
You are? What bar?,Michael
I'm at the bar. The bar that's located in the lobby of the hotel.,Deangelo
I... do not see you.,Michael
How long have you...,Deangelo
"I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour.",Michael
"Ok, me too.",Deangelo
[looking up from phones in unison] Sorry...,Deangelo/Michael
What're you wearing?,Michael
"I am wearing a grey suit, red tie.",Deangelo
Are we both at the right place?,Michael
Which place?,Deangelo
I hear your voice.,Michael
"I hear your voice, I see your lips moving.",Deangelo
"I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man! [holds out hand] Michael Scott.",Michael
Deangelo Vickers.,Deangelo
Wow... that is insane! [laughter],Michael
"That is insane, that is the right term. Let's get some Vodka up in this cranberry, and one for my friend.",Deangelo
[entering Dunder Mifflin offices] Here we go! Are you ready?,Michael
I am ready.,Deangelo
Alright! Here we go!,Michael
This is it. What do you think?,Michael
"Oh, she'll do. She'll do just fine.",Deangelo
"I am very much looking forward to tommorow. It feels like the culmanation of a lot of hard work, a lot of good fortune...",Deangelo
"[pops up from below camera, and runs out of room]",Michael
Did that? Did that just happen?! [runs after Michael] We should.. we should write a movie or something! I'm serious!,Deangelo
Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.,Oscar
"[wearing wig] Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]",Kevin
"Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it's own sake. So, without further ado, let's start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers!",Michael
"[blinds roll down, Deangelo waving]",Deangelo
Come on out!,Michael
Hello! [opens door] How are you sir?,Deangelo
"I am well, sir, how are you?",Michael
"Can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. Little bit about myself, I love the American Southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy, something I live with, it's a part of me. I've learned to cope with it. What else, I'm just as comfortable at the ball game as I am at the opera. I was a-",Deangelo
Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.,Dwight
[drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know...,Kelly
[picks up paper] I'll help you.,Deangelo
"Oh, hi! [obviously flirting body language]",Kelly
Hello!,Deangelo
Have we met before?,Kelly
"No, not officially, actually, I saw you walking out of the bathroom before.",Deangelo
"Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.",Kelly
[offers Kelly the papers as she walks away],Deangelo
And that is what you call a meet cute.,Kelly
"And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it's Deangelo the whole time!",Michael
Kind of embarassing.,Darryl
"Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.",Angela
"I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!",Michael
"Oh. [chuckles] That was... let's see, where's my replacement? Where's the guy I'm replacing? Why don't I look to the left? He's sitting right there! [office laughs]",Deangelo
Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...,Michael
[silences Michael],Deangelo
"That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. [holds up 'Hello, my name is..,'] nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.",Andy
[laughs] Office funny guy! Always glad to have an office funny guy around!,Deangelo
"I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.",Andy
"This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.",Michael
"Well, it wasn't an affair.",Pam
Yes it was.,Michael
"But, no, but we are a family.",Pam
[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.,Jim
Cecelia.,Pam
"Well, congratulations. I have four kids of my own.",Deangelo
"Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. [laughs]",Pam
Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!,Pam
"Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.",Jim
Thanks for meeting me.,Dwight
Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.,Michael
"There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.",Dwight
"You know me very well, Dwight.",Michael
"That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy.",Dwight
Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.,Michael
"I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.",Dwight
That apple looks delic!,Meredith
I do a lot of portion control. I try to keep my daily calor intake under 1200. [laughter],Deangelo
"Deangelo, you're going to starve to death. [laughter]",Stanley
So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!,Michael
It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.,Darryl
"It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.",Darryl
I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.,Darryl
Here's the great thing about the southwest; there's so much more than desert. Along the north rim of the Grand Canyon is a forest as lush as you've ever seen.,Deangelo
"Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.",Kevin
"Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?",Angela
I did not.,Deangelo
"Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know.",Angela
"Sounds very interesting, thank you.",Deangelo
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.",Erin
Why do you use your name when you use the phone?,Deangelo
"Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.",Erin
Try it without using your name.,Deangelo
"Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!",Erin
"Dunder Mifflin, how may I assist you?",Deangelo
"Oh, assist.",Erin
I sorta like the old way.,Michael
I just prefer it without the name and I thought- I've got to start doing some managing at some point.,Deangelo
"I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just-",Michael
And it really isn't.,Deangelo
Is that good?,Michael
"Yeah, ok, good.",Erin
"Well, I'd like to change it, actually.",Deangelo
"Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.",Michael
What do you think?,Erin
I think a change would be nice.,Deangelo
You can do the old way or whatever you think would work. [phone rings],Michael
[whispering] Change it.,Denagelo
[picks up phone] ...I'm so sorry. Sorry. [hangs up],Erin
"Hey, funny guy. Wanna have a little mid-day lawl here. Make me laugh, huh? What you got? I can't even look at you.",Deangelo
Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call... [laughter],Andy
"Deangelo, did you order a barber?",Erin
"Oh, yeah. Put a pin on that, kid. Can't wait to hear the punchline.",Deangelo
"Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?",Darryl
I... don't know. Help me.,Andy
[a barber enters the office for Deangelo] That is so badass. So hardcore.,Ryan
"Yeah, real cool. Real power move.",Phyllis
I saw a hawk today. Just sitting right there on the overpass. Looking at me.,Deangelo
[to Erin] Shave me. [walks into office with Deangelo] This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!,Michael
"Ok, alright! I love it! I love it! Michael, this is Reggie. He is the #1 yelp reviewed shaver in Scranton. It's not even close.",Deangelo
"And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go. [Erin puts too much shaving cream on Michael's face, none on the neck]",Michael
"Alright. This is how we do it. Feels nice, doesn't it?",Deangelo
"It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.",Michael
You wanted to talk to us Deangelo?,Oscar
"Ah, yes, please! Just cozy up there. Just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups.",Deangelo
"Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do... [Erin shaves Michael] god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-",Michael
"Ok, then, powwows then, fine.",Deangelo
That's-,Michael
"Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.",Pam
"Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.",Jim
Da-das.,Pam
And what happens here is-,Jim
"You know what, enough about your baby, ok? I'm sorry.",Deangelo
We were... I think she was just trying to-,Jim
"No, no, no, I know what you're doing. Just quit it. I want to hear from the rank and file. How can I be the best manager for you all? What can I do better?",Deangelo
"You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.",Michael
"Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.",Oscar
"Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about.",Michael
"Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.",Erin
Don't shave my lips.,Michael
[Andy walks into room] What's up?,Deangelo
"I don't mean to go into a rant here, but...",Andy
"I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.",Andy
"...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.",Andy
"Let's not talk politics in the office, ok? I like you better as a funny guy.",Deangelo
[leans on table] I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where- [table collapses under Andy],Andy
[laughter] Now that's funny! That's funny! You walk much?,Deangelo
"Yeah, right, I mean- [walks into door, jokingly]",Andy
Little click...,Deangelo
"[pushing box into office] Deangelo, this box came for you.",Erin
"Thank you. That's my stuff. Yeah. Michael, take a look at this.",Deangelo
Need a hand?,Stanley
"Oh, that'd be great, thank you Stanley!",Deangelo
"You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here-",Michael
"[holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]",Ryan
"I still have to look at this stuff, guys.",Michael
"So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?",Darryl
"Yep, ten-gallon hat. Technically, it only holds about three quartz. Little factoid.",Deangelo
Interesting.,Kevin
"Deangelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a great fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy.",Michael
[holds out cowboy boots for Darryl],Darryl's sister
"Cool, cool. Alright, see you later.",Darryl
"Hey, hey, hey! [holds up set of pistols in holsters]",Darryl's sister
"No, I'm good. Keep them.",Darryl
"Hey, funny man! Whatcha got for me? Make me laugh?",Deangelo
"[mimes using a rope to pull himself forward to microwave] Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here... [throws tea packets into air, puts hand in unplugged toaster, pretends to be shocked, takes container of cheese-puffs and throws them into air, pours hot coffee on his pants]",Andy
[laughs] Drink some soap!,Deangelo
[drinks hand soap],Andy
[laughter and applause],Deangelo
I guess this is my life now.,Andy
How do I become a manger at Sabre?,Dwight
"First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here.",Gabe
I left a message at corporate.,Dwight
Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening.,Gabe
Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?,Dwight
What recommendation?,Gabe
From when he recommended me to replace him.,Dwight
"...I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.",Gabe
"Best whale watching: easily the west coast. If you're going whale watching on the East Coast, you might wanna bring a magazine called 'West Coast Whales'. [laughter] Because you're not gonna see them-",Deangelo
[interrupting Deangelo] Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour!,Michael
Awesome!,Kevin
"Mmm, whatcha got?",Phyllis
"PB and J, my mom's recipe! [throws sandwitch at Phyllis]",Michael
Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.,Angela
I need a wide berth. I need a wide berth from those nuts.,Deangelo
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?,Stanley
"I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go! [throws sandwitch into Kevin's open mouth]",Michael
"Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?",Oscar
What?,Michael
"Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, ok? I had to take baths constantly. I missed the O.J. verdict. I had to read about it in the paper like an idiot.",Deangelo
"Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?",Jim
"No, Jim, not everything is life or death. I want to feel comfortable.",Deangelo
"Oscar, here you go. [throws sandwitch]",Michael
[uses book to stop the sandwitch's flight] You're getting nut particles all in the air!,Deangelo
No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.,Michael
"[steps into conference room] Everyone, mandatory meeting. Multi-purpose room, now.",Deangelo
"No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. [disgusted comments by co-workers] No body go in there. Stay where you are.",Michael
"Michael, This is insane.",Oscar
"No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No.",Michael
"Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.",Jim
"Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.",Michael
"Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room.",Dwight
"[walks out] Hold on, Hey Michael, Michael, wait up, hold on. Um, so for these meetings do you just jump into business or do you start with some chit-chat or...?",Deangelo
"I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine.",Michael
"Maybe. Maybe not. 50/50. You know what, it is too bad for this place that you're leaving. [extents hands for hug] Bring it in, come on. [Michael doesn't accept hug] Ok. [walks back]",Deangelo
Ok. [hugs Deangelo from behind] Why did you have to be so damn good?,Michael
I... I'm adequete. I'm half as good as you.,Deangelo
"No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.",Michael
"Will you do me a favour and enjoy this time, ok? You've worked so hard, get your senioritis on. It's Lake Havasu time!",Deangelo
Guess I've been working so hard I forgot what it's like to be hardly working.,Micahel
Ok. What is the Native American girl's name?,Deangelo
You'll figure it out.,Michael
"Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?",Jim
That's a cute baby. Very cute baby. Adorable. Very cute.,Deangelo
Thank you very much.,Jim
"See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand.",Pam
We're back in! Right?,Jim
"I swear, that baby could be the star of a show entitled 'Babys I Don't Care About.'",Deangelo
It is six a.m. [DeAngelo yawns] and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!,Michael
"Yes, and this happens every...?",DeAngelo
"Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend. [DeAngelo laughs]",Michael
"Well, you know, why don't we try it, and if it goes good it'll be part of my tradition.",DeAngelo
Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.,Michael
"[arriving at the first house] Alright let's go! [DeAngelo runs in the wrong direction] This way, this way! [Michael knocks on the door]",Michael
Thanks.,DeAngelo
Surprise!,Michael
Congratulations!,DeAngelo
"Yep, okay...",Jim
You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!,Michael
Okay.,Jim

Stay in bed!,Jim
[next house] Congratulations!,Michael
Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!,Stanley
We got it.,Michael
"Uh, leave it at the door or...?",DeAngelo
Yeah that's fine.,Michael
[next house] Hey Toby! You suck! [throwing eggs at his house],Michael
Is this an employee of ours?,DeAngelo
[giggles] Go go go go go go!,Michael
"[arriving at a dumpy looking, unkempt house] I've never seen this place in the daylight.",Michael
It reminds me of Katrina.,DeAngelo
"Here we go, alright got it? Set? [the door is ajar, Michael knocks lightly] Hello? [turns around to see Meredith walking towards her house]",Michael
I'm so busted! Walk of shame!,Meredith
Do you usually leave your door unlocked? And ajar?,DeAngelo
"Ahh, Nice! I got a Dundie nomination!",Meredith
Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.,Michael
No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. [walks into her house] Let me fix you breakfast!,Meredith
[whispers] I'm not going in there.,DeAngelo
[quietly shuts the door] Go.,Michael
[walking into the office] Good morning Erin.,Michael
"Oh hey, didn't see you.",Erin
You have big plans for tonight?,Michael
"I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!! [Flashes her Nomination Certificate]",Erin
You are getting so funny! [Erin giggles] Very good.,Michael
"The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.",Michael
Anything can happen at the Dundies! [DeAngelo laughs] They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!,Michael
"Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.",Dwight
Black tie optional.,Michael
Every day is black tie optional!,Dwight
"A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!",Michael
Nice! [rest of the office looks excited],Kevin
I love their breadsticks!,Phyllis
"Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!",Pam
I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.,Ryan
"Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?",Pam
"I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.",Ryan
"You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad. [Jim does his 'Jim face']",Pam
"Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right?",Michael
Yeah that's great.,Ryan
"So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. [Dwight looks suspecting] And that person is [he and DeAngelo roll their tongues as a drum roll] DeAngelo! [all applaud]",Michael
"Always the padawan, never the Jedi.",Dwight
"Thank you Michael, uh, but I will have to pass.",DeAngelo
Think of it as part of your training.,Michael
"Not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay...",DeAngelo
"[smiling] Okay, well we'll work on it.",Michael
"[whispers to Michael] Michael, I'm very, very bad.",DeAngelo
You are doing it.,Michael
[all in conference room] Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.,Michael
Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.,Kevin
"Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.",Michael
"That is true, we do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems, for me it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe one with a-",DeAngelo
"[cutting him off] Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys...",Michael
This did not happen.,DeAngelo
Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay. [Ryan stands next to Michael up front] Ryan how are you today?,Michael
"Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.",Ryan
[very excited] There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration. Just be funny.,Michael
"Uhhh, you sir! [points to Jim] Are we having fun tonight?",DeAngelo
Having a great time.,Jim
Oh good!,DeAngelo
"Thanks, yeah.",Jim
Where were you on September 11th?,DeAngelo
No! God! [Jim looks at him oddly],Michael
"This is so weird! If I'm conducting a meeting, good to go. But if I think of it as a performance... I-I fall apart. Obviously.",DeAngelo
Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.,Andy
"No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!",Michael
"Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.",Jim
"Jim, please no loopholes.",Michael
"Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?",Darryl
"This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?",Michael
"[laying down, Michael is sitting on DeAngelo's stomach bouncing up and down in Michael's office] Me mo. Me mo.",DeAngelo
Good. Good. Good!,Michael
"Meee Mo, Mee!",DeAngelo
"Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.",Michael
"When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court and choose between them.",DeAngelo
"[getting off his stomach] Too personal. I don't wanna hear about it. [picking up a portable tape player] Let's try this. Put these on. [DeAngelo puts the headphones in] I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you can't- [DeAngelo winces] That's right, you're not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this, [gives him a card] and make it sound perfect.",Michael
"THE DUNDIES ARE-OW-ABOUT COMING TOGETHER! AND RECOGNIZING, THE ADOMINABILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT! [Jim comes and closes the door]",DeAngelo
Say it with an accent!,Michael
[bad Australian accent attempt] THE DUNDIES!,DeAngelo
[also in a poor Australian accent] The Dundies!,Michael
THE DUNDIES!,DeAngelo
"[Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.",Jim
"Yeah... [they see Erin eating in her car, and ducking when they see her. Pam knocks on her car window] Hey, Erin, everything okay?",Pam
"Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.",Erin
Who's gonna see us?,Jim
[desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in!,Erin
Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat],Jim
Please! Sorry. Get in. [Jim and Pam are confused and worried] Sorry sorry sorry.,Erin
What's wrong?,Pam
I eat lunch in the car now. It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.,Erin
Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?,Pam
"I, really don't like spending time with him.",Erin
"Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?",Pam
I think I'm gonna go.,Jim
What?,Pam
I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!,Jim
Thank you Jim.,Erin
"I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.",Jim
"I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.",Erin
"Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods]",Pam
[standing by the Louie Volpies entrance greeting people and giving them menus],Dwight
[walks in] Hi!,Kevin
Appalling. [Meredith walks in] Eye sore. [Jim and Pam come in] Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!,Dwight
"DeAngelo, Jo's on the phone for you.",Erin
Hello?,DeAngelo
"[Michael dressed as Jo Bennett, using a bad Southern accent] DeAngelo! We're in serious horse manure here! The Dundies are tonight! And we ain't got no host!",Jo
Oh no!,DeAngelo
Luckily I have someone for you!,Jo
Billy Crystal?,DeAngelo
Better.,Jo
Neil Patrick Harris?,DeAngelo
He's in Little Shop of Horrors on Broadway. Now we need Michael Scott! The best darn Dundies host on both sides of the Mississippi! [everyone in the audience is laughing],Jo
"Ughhh, I gotta find Michael Scott! And then I gotta, [Russel Brand impression] Get Him to the Dundies!",DeAngelo
"[in the office near the accountants] Hey, can you help me find Michael Scott Angela?",DeAngelo
"[Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.",Angela
[laughing],Audience
Mmhmm.,DeAngelo
"Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!",Angela
[laughing],Oscar
"Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.",Oscar
Jim! Do you know where I can find Michael Scott?,DeAngelo
"[Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim's actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?",Jim
[shaking head at the camera],Jim
No one is listening to me! And I'm running out of time!,DeAngelo
"[Micheal dressed as Phyllis, pretending to knit] Well, what are you talking about? [cracking noise] Ohh! Ohh! [falls onto the ground] I've fallen and I can't get up!",Phyllis
"Maybe I just need to look into my heart. [in the bathroom in front of the mirror] DeAngelo, where is Michael Scott. [his reflection in the mirror turns around to reveal that it is Michael]",DeAngelo
I'm here. [DeAngelo gasps and turns around] In a good way! I've been here the whole time.,Michael
"The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.",Oscar
"Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. [Michael comes running up to stage as people applaud] Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! [DeAngelo presents himself, and changes his mind and runs off] Was that part of the...?",Dwight
"[in the bathroom] DeAngelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there!",Michael
"Go do it by yourself, get Ryan.",DeAngelo
"No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It's sort of our perk!",Michael
"This was not, part of the job description!",DeAngelo
"Listen to me, you're not doing this for me, you're not doing this for you, you're not even doing this for them!",Michael
Who am I doing this for?,DeAngelo
"[slaps him] You're doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid's menu, wondering: Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say: It's showtime. Get out there.",Michael
I can't. [Michael slaps him again],DeAngelo
Say it.,Michael
"Stop, hitting me.",DeAngelo
"You can do it, just say it.",Michael
Hit me again. [Michael slaps him once more],DeAngelo
"Now hit me. [DeAngelo slaps him] One, two, three.",Michael
It's showtime.,Together
"Alright, here we go.",Michael
Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line. [everyone laughs],Michael
Fall asleep right after sex. Huh guys?,DeAngelo
"Nope, go back to the script.",Jim
"There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie! [Dwight plays a celebratory honking noise on his keyboard]",Michael
"Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?",Jim
Well done.,Michael
"I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!",Jim
Alright. [all applaud Jim],Michael
You didn't think to mention me huh?,Pam
Didn't I?,Jim
"Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie. [Pam gets ready and Jim smiles at her] I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!",Michael
"[jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!",Meredith
"Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?",Dwight
I gotta go do this.,Jim
[annoyed] Why?,Pam
Big smiles folks! There they are.,Dwight
"Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to, [Ryan stands up] Danny Cordray! [Ryan quickly sits] Danny couldn't be here tonight...",Michael
"How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.",Ryan
"Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that. [Stanley looks angry] But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson! [Stanley slowly walks over, angry] Come on up here you sick bastard.",Michael
I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.,Phyllis
"They say he's going to be my right hand man, adlib masturbation joke. [realizing he wasn't supposed to read that directly off the cue card, speaks quietly] No, I hate this, I hate it so much. [loud again] Dwight Schrute! Please accept this promising Assistant Manager Dundie. [people clap as Dwight takes the microphone, he is obviously unenthused] Thank you, thank you so much. I would like to thank something that we, uh, take for granted in our daily lives. And that is the humble trashcan. [Creed nods] This is for you trashcan! [walks off and throws the Dundie into the trashcan]",DeAngelo
"[the manager of Louie Volpies approaches a giggling Kevin, who is coloring with crayons on the tablecloth] Who gave you those crayons?",Manager
I brought them from home! Do you have a red?,Kevin
This is a cloth tablecloth! You can't color on it!,Manager
Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.,Kevin
"You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults? [manager looks up, angrily at Michael] Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonald's wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award! [Erin looks thrilled and walks up to the stage]",Michael
That is bull! [throws her Dundie],Meredith
"Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.",Erin
What?,Gabe
"I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me.",Erin
"[stands up and walks to stage, takes the microphone] Well, this is embarrassing, um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. It's that quarter life crisis everyone's been talking about. [Jim is looking wide eyed, jaw dropped] Alright I'm gonna go. [Dwight plays cricket noises]",Gabe
[escorts Erin off stage] There you go.,Michael
Damn that was cold.,Darryl
"It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers. [DeAngelo jogs up and takes the Dundie and tries to go back to his seat]",Michael
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!,Audience
"Hold on, hold on one second. [puts on the headphones and turns the volume up all the way] I WANNA, I WANNA, I FEEL TRULY BLESSED! UHHH, TO BE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU! BEFORE THIS ALL STARTED, FUNNY STORY, I WAS IN THE BATHROOM, VOMITTING, AND VOMITTING IN THE MEN'S ROOM!",DeAngelo
"Okay, okay. [trying to stop him from offending other people in his restaurant]",Manager
THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR MOST OF THE EVENING...,DeAngelo
"[stopping Manager] DeAngelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo.",Michael
"This is truly special, for me! And uh, anyway. It's so much lighter!",DeAngelo
"Okay, we're done! That's it.",Michael
"Michael, are we?!",DeAngelo
We're done. We're done!,Michael
"[Outside of the restaurant, obviously sad] So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it'd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well...",Michael
"Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!",Pam
What?,Michael
I know I'm the cause of this royal screw up but I would like to see this show go on.,DeAngelo
"No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.",Michael
"Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. [others nod in agreement]",Pam
"So what you're saying is you kinda like it? [Phyllis impression] I've fallen and I can't get up! [normal again] That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.",Michael
"I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-",Jim
That got a big laugh.,Michael
That did. Pretty huge laugh.,Jim
"[to Stanley, who is cracking up again] You were laughing right?",Michael
I was.,Stanley
"[with Dwight and Michael outside Michael's car] You know what, I have to go to the bathroom.",DeAngelo
We're really close.,Michael
I can just run over to the gas station.,DeAngelo
We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?,Dwight
"That's true, we wouldn't get seats together.",Michael
"Okay, fine I'll hold it.",DeAngelo
"[in the car] You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.",Michael
I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.,Dwight
Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.,Michael
"Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!",Dwight
"[as Michael pulls over and stops the car] Please don't stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, you're sitting in the backseat, baby.",DeAngelo
What is your problem?!,Michael
"I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.",Dwight
"Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.",Michael
"And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!",Dwight
"[very uncomfortable] Look, what ever you're going to do, how long is it going to take? Ballpark. 'Cause I just, I gotta make a decision here. [gets out and slams the door]",DeAngelo
He is in an all-out sprint.,Michael
"[in conference room] Here... [Andy walks in] Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard! [Andy walks up]",Michael
"A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.",Andy
"Oh, okay. [nods to him]",Michael
"I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.",Andy
[starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down],Darryl
"Oh my God, something's happening.",Michael
"[singing] Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.",Andy
"Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That's how many minutes, that you've worked here.",All
In costumes!,Pam
And impressions!,Jim
In meetings.,Toby
And cups of coffee.,Erin and Kelly
For birthdays!,Kevin

I forgive you for kissing me!,Oscar

"Call, text or e-mail, or call.",Kelly and Erin
[falsetto] Measure your life in love!,DeAngelo
"Remember to call, remember to, call. Remember to call.",All
"[choked up] Yeah, okay. [pauses, then takes a deep breath] Well this is gonna hurt like a mother[bleep].",Michael
"[recall to Dundies at Louie Volpies] Every day, millions of Americans suffer from extreme repulsiveness. Someone in our midst, is bringing that problem to light. Toby Flenderson, please come up here and accept the Extreme Repulsiveness Award. Oh that's so mean!",DeAngelo
No it's not.,Michael
"[Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies.",Oscar
You gotta play along man.,Jim
Come on Toby.,Oscar
Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it! [Toby comes up and take the mic],Michael
"I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty any more. [Dwight plays a clip from the song Oh Yeah: Ohhhh yeah! Chica chicaaa]",Toby
"[sitting on the roof of the office building] Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here, getting used to the altitude.",Michael
[walking up] Michael?,Dwight
Yes?,Michael
I've got a treat for you!,Dwight
"Ahh, thank you. Like a butler.",Michael
"Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.",Dwight
"[Michael takes one and bites] Oh, these do not taste like oysters.",Michael
"[angrily] That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!",Dwight
Sick freak! What is wrong with you?,Michael
What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!,Dwight
"I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? [Dwight scoffs] The job was not mine to give. [sighs] Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.",Michael
Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?,Dwight
"Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket...",Michael
Great idea.,Dwight
...in order to feed the bears.,Michael
Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!,Dwight
How do you mean?,Michael
"Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!",Dwight
"Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?",Michael
Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!,Dwight
Okay.,Michael
[with Michael in his office] You're not gonna take all these toys are you?,DeAngelo
Hm?,Michael
"I mean you don't have a job lined up, so it's not like you have a desk to put 'em on.",DeAngelo
Well I have interviews.,Michael
"That's nice. [reaches and a grabs a toy truck] How 'bout that truck? Can I have this little truck? I was thinking I might... glue a stapler on top. Or put a hole here, stick pens in it. [Michael gives an obviously fake smile] You okay?",DeAngelo
"Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.",Michael
"You know what? Uh, it's your last couple days, I'm gonna get out of your hair.",DeAngelo
"Oh you don't, that's-",Michael
I will be in the break room.,DeAngelo
That sounds good. Thank you.,Michael
Dead man walking.,DeAngelo
"Sad? No, no, no. I don't leave 'til tomorrow, so... Tomorrow I will be a wreck.",Michael
[sees Andy walk into the Men's Room and follows him in] Stay away from Erin! [cornering him in the bathroom],Gabe
Hey!,Andy
I'm your boss!,Gabe
"Why don't you, uh, stay away from me?",Andy
"No, I'm gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don't wanna get on my bad side! I've seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!",Gabe
Okay! That's so weird! Just go away!,Andy
"No! You go away! [storms out, toilet flushes, Jim exits the bathroom]",Gabe
[weak] Hi Tuna.,Andy
So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?,Jim
"[in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?",Phyllis
Please.,Angela
What's wrong with cupcakes?,Pam
Everything.,Angela
[walking in] There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!,Michael
Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.,Pam
We thought.,Pam
It's an experiment.,Angela
The three of us have all been chairmen before.,Phyllis
So this is the dream team.,Pam
[walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?!,Meredith
The dream team... and Meredith.,Angela
"[to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.",Meredith
Mmm!,Michael
Yeah that was a surprise...,Phyllis
"You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla.",Michael
[surprised] Okay.,Pam
"Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?",Michael
Should we get toppings?,Pam
What do you like Pam?,Michael
[confused] What?,Pam
What kind of toppings would you like?,Michael
Hot fudge?,Pam
Sounds good. Fudge it up! [all seem surprised at Michael's behavior],Michael
"[holding up his 'World's Best Boss Mug'] I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. [holds up a Dundie that reads, 'World's Best Boss 2011, Michael G. Scott', throws his mug into the garbage can and places his Dundie at the front of his desk] I still need something to drink out of though.",Michael
"[pulls out a list of everyone in the office, then puts it back in his jacket] Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis.",Michael
Please Michael.,Phyllis
"When Phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute. [Phyllis looks relieved] And she still is.",Michael
I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.,Phyllis
"[holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.",Phyllis
Ahh.,Michael
"It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.",Phyllis
"[hesitantly] Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well! [goes into his office and comes out with a bag] And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind. [presents to her a mouth wind-up chattering toy]",Michael
It's cute. [plays with it],Phyllis
"Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt. [gives Stanley a small felt table] May you never lose the fun loving quality in life.",Michael
"Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.",Stanley
"Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts. [other salesmen look outraged]",Michael
Wow.,Andy
[angry] Yeah wow!,Stanley
You know I'm the worst salesman here right?,Andy
"But you're the best salesman, on the inside.",Michael
What does that even mean?,Phyllis
"You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.",Michael
I'm gonna lose 'em.,Andy
You're not gonna lose them.,Michael
I promise you that I will.,Andy
Just do your best! I have faith in you.,Michael
"[as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!",Stanley
No.,Andy
[to Dwight] Do you believe that?!,Phyllis
I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.,Dwight
"I used to be obese. Once you've conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I'm not saying I'm superman, but, let me just put it this way. If I were shot in the head, I'm pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it. [winks]",DeAngelo
"Kevin, I have something for you.",Michael
Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza],Kevin
You know who that is?,Michael
Oh...,Kevin
"[rips the poster in half] Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?",Michael
Better...,Kevin
"Good, stand up. [Kevin does so] You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore.",Michael
But...,Kevin
You will find love.,Michael
"Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.",Kevin
"Don't be. You should never settle for who you are. [moving on] Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-",Michael
"I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!",Andy
"[quietly groans] Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this. [takes a sack tied in the upper middle making a crude head, with a face drawn on, obviously the product of poor craftsmanship, Oscar pretends to like it]",Michael
Thank you Michael. It's beautiful.,Oscar
"[laughing] It looks like a [more laughing] It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! [laughs more] He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!",Michael
"Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point?",Michael
It was just you...,Angela
"How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.",Michael
State Senator.,Oscar
"Mmhmm, bravo!",Michael
Brava!,Oscar
You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.,Angela

Yeah. [Oscar shakes his head no],Angela
"[walking into the kitchen, DeAngelo is using the coffee machine to cook chicken covered in melted chocolate] Hey.",Andy

I'm going to!,Kevin
"[to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.",Jim
"Nah, I'm almost done.",Michael
You sure?,Jim
Yeah.,Michael
So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.,Pam
Finally! That old shredder sucked.,Kevin
"It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.",Pam
"Yeah, it won't shred magazines.",Kevin
It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.,Pam
I know...,Kevin
Did you break the shredder Kevin?,Jim
"No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that'll shred magazines.",Kevin
I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.,Pam
"[crying] I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one, and I don't think my credits will transfer. Ugh, and you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote. [picks World's Best Boss mug out of the trashcan and puts it back on his desk] I gotta call her, and I'm going to tell her, that I cannot come. [dials on his phone]",Michael
[on phone] Hello there!,Holly
Hi. What is the name of our town?,Michael
Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay?,Holly
"No, no. I just needed to hear your voice.",Michael
[Yoda voice] Oh you mean this?,Holly
[laughing] Yes. [Olive Oyl impression] Yes my hero!,Michael
"[deep man voice] I'll pay the rent! [Michael laughs] Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom!",Holly
"[laughing] Ohh, I miss you.",Michael

Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.,Michael
I love you too.,Holly
"[hangs up and composes himself] Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four. [looks at the list of members of the office, with some names crossed out] And I have said goodbye to half of them.",Michael
"Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.",Toby
"[grimaces and nods, Toby nods back at him] Okay.",Michael
[smiling] Okay.,Toby
[walks over to Kelly] Kelly! Kelly? Kelly.,Michael
[doing make up and irritated] What?!,Kelly
"If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you?",Michael
Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.,Kelly

Yeah.,Michael
This is... totally unnecessary.,Ryan
You're not prone to seizures?,Michael

[quickly] Erotic.,Meredith
See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.,Angela
"Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]",Phyllis
I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.,Meredith
Good God...,Angela
"They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!",Meredith
"I don't, I don't think we sh-",Pam
"I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.",Meredith
"[stopping her] Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.",Pam
"As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.",Phyllis
"You know what, I think we should get some other input.",Pam
I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.,Kelly
"Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said.",Phyllis
"No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.",Angela
"[sees Pam walking towards the door of the office] Um, Pam.",Michael
"Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later.",Pam
[disappointed] Okay... [Jim is confused],Michael
"[walking into the women's bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe!",Erin
I need to talk to you!,Gabe
You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!,Erin
"Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]",abe
Hey Creed.,Erin
Not cool man. [walks out],Creed
I really think you should leave.,Erin
"Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room.",Gabe
"Can we talk about this later, I have to go.",Erin
"Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one. [leans in for a kiss]",Gabe
Gabe!,Erin
Okay... [walks out embarrassed],Gabe
"[on video cam with his brother] Here's the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.",Toby
I can bring him a welcome basket. I'll surprise him.,Rory
Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-,Toby
Does he like jams? My shelves are over flowing with preserves.,Rory
"Well, no. He hates jams.",Toby
[walking into Darryl's office] Darryl!,Michael
Hey.,Darryl
"I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage. [hands him a thin black folder] Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you.",Michael
"That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.",Darryl
"Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer.",Michael
No. Can't let you do that Mike.,Darryl
No problem. Worth a try.,Michael
[in warehouse] Darryl said I could use the bailer because I'm leaving.,Michael
No.,Warehouse Guy
"[picks up a basketball and dribbles it away from the basket] Alright guys, well... see ya later warehouse. Catch you on the flippity flip. [throws the ball behind him and misses the basket, tries and misses several more times]",Michael
"[in car with Andy] okay, so what's our approach? You a veteran? Do I have a month to live? You gonna get married tomorrow? What? [Andy stares blankly] Hmm?",DeAngelo
I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.,Andy
"That's stupid. [laughing. Nervously, Andy laughs with him]",DeAngelo
[joking] What do I know?,Andy
[still laughing] What do you know? We gotta get psyched up! Okay? Guy? Let's get psyched! Is there an animal shelter on the way?,DeAngelo
[confused] Yeah.,Andy
Awesome! Ani Ani Shelto! Here we come. Do you know how to high-five?,DeAngelo
Yeah!,Andy
Cause if you do now's the time.,DeAngelo
[going for it] Alright.,Andy
Not while I'm driving.,DeAngelo
"[still trying the backwards basket] Catch you guys- [forklift drives in front of the camera] Catch you guys on the filippity flip. [misses and picks it up again] Flippity flip! [misses again and grabs it back] Flippity flip! [makes it in, gets excited] Really? [composes himself] Okay, see ya guys! [walks away, containing his self-pleasure]",Michael
[at the animal shelter with Andy] You know how I met Jo Bennett? And got started on my ladder of success?,DeAngelo
No. I don't.,Andy
"[hands Andy a dog] I'm walking along, out of work. Again. Thinking to myself, 'I only have enough cash to by a sandwich, or get drunk. And I see this guy trying to steal this lady's dog! So I grab the dog. He runs off. She's so grateful, she hires me.",DeAngelo
"Awwhh, wow.",Andy
Gimme that dog! That's not your dog! [takes the dog from a confused Andy] Yeah! Again.,DeAngelo
"Oh, okay...",Andy
Gimme that damn dog you f***ing thief! Don't ever do It again! [Andy nods modestly] You hear me?! [Andy nods again] You feel that energy?,DeAngelo
Mmhmmm.,Andy
"Wooo! Yeah! [parades in circles with the dog, pretends to whack Andy with it] [giving it to Andy] Okay, again.",DeAgnelo
"I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.",Erin
Kevin?,Michael
Andy.,Erin
Ahhhh...,Michael
"I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.",Erin
Maybe neither.,Michael
I'm not attracted to Kevin.,Erin
"Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. [Erin is smiling] And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. [kisses her head] And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.",Michael
[nods] Extension 147.,Erin
N-,Michael
I know.,Erin
"Okay. [both chuckling. Michael leaves Erin, looking thoughtful]",Michael
[on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?,Phyllis
"Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?",Michael
No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!,Phyllis
"Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.",Michael
Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera],Phyllis
"Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. [pulls out an envelope from his jacket]",Michael
Yes.,Dwight
So I wanted to give you that. [hands him the envelope] It's a letter of recommendation. [Dwight looks eager. Michael nods to him and walks away],Michael
"This is gonna be good. [eagerly reading the letter] To whom it may concern. [off to the side] Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. [reading again] The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. [to the side again] That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. [reading again, slowly gets sadder] I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. [holding back tears] Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? [pulling out a small card from the envelope. Reads it] Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. [checks his watch quickly] Ohhh, yeah.",Dwight
"[opening his trunk excitedly and gets out his paintball gear, takes his gun and looks for Michael, gives up, Michael jumps out of the dumpster shooting, they shoot each other, yell, laugh, and taunt, having a great time]",Dwight
"[in the office, crosses Dwight off his list. He has paint in his messed up hair, and is containing his laughter]",Michael
"[giving his and Andy's pitch to a client] I would just like to start off saying, I have not worked with Mr. Andy Bernard for very long, I can say, is that he is no Michael Scott. I can't sit here and tell you he's gonna be a success. I can't sit here and tell you that he's even the best man for the job. [Andy looks awkward] But I can say this: He's got potential. Sure. You know, I always say: go big, or go home. You go with This guy, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life, OR, the biggest, Good decision of your life. It's either gonna be the best thing you ever did, or the worst thing you ever did. If you want some boring, white bread clock-watcher who's gonna get you your paper when you ordered it, for the agreed upon price, [Andy looks hopeful] Andy's not your guy. [Andy deflates] You ever play Russian Roulette? [scoffs] Time to spin the chamber horse. By signing up for another year. [hands the client a folder he needs signed for another year's contract]",DeAngelo
"[Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?",Jim
You should see the other guy.,Michael
[smiles knowingly],Dwight
[looks at the clock to see it is three o'clock] Jim where is Pam?,Michael
"Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.",Jim
"But it is already three o'clock! [Michael leaves, Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]",Michael
[walks into a movie theater showing The King's Speech],Pam
"[in his office talking to Creed, Gabe, and Meredith in that order] Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay.",Michael
Yeah I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.,Michael
"[Gabe is still standing in front of Michael's desk] And you, why are you still here.",Michael
"[sounding hurt] I'm either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed.",Gabe
"No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? [Gabe nods] A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite. [Gabe looks awkward and Michael winks]",Michael
[walking out the client's room with Andy] That is cold sir! Absolutely cold. You know what? It was a complete waste of my time.,DeAngelo
"Uh DeAngelo, I'm, uh. I forgot my bag, so I'll meet you in the car.",Andy
[grumbles] Okay whatever.,DeAngelo
"[walks into the client's office again] Sir, I'd just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call.",Andy
Keep talking.,Client
"[on his phone waiting for Andy, next to their car] Yes. Okay, alright. No, well thank you! Alright, take care. [hangs up] You'll never guess, we did it!",DeAngelo
[laughing] Hey! [they hug] Good job boss!,Andy
We did it!,DeAngelo
"[standing in front of his office, sees that it is three forty five] Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this! [Dwight runs into the conference room. All others follow]",Michael
"Yes, what is this about?",Stanley
What is this meeting about?,Michael
Mmhmmm.,Stanley
"Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam. [Jim looks regretful] And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four.",Michael
They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-,Phyllis
[cutting her off] Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!,Michael
Is that it?,Stanley
"Umm, hmm?",Michael
Is that it?,Stanley
"[the office looks up expectantly] Ummm... Hm... No. [changing his mind] No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in. [walks out and then back in, now using a Vietnamese accent] Oh hi everybody, it's Ping! [the office groans] And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful! [only Kevin is laughing. Stanley tries to leave. Michael hugs him] I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!",Michael
"Hey, can I talk to you for a second?",Jim
Sure. [Ping accent] Be right out!,Michael
"[brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.",Jim
[sad] Ohh...,Michael
"What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?",Jim
[holding back tears] Okay...,Michael
You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?,Jim
Maybe.,Michael
"Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.",Jim
Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?,Michael
Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.,Jim
"[pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it] T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. [starts to cry] You started with this company, as a fine young man...",Michael
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.,Jim
"Oh, okay.",Michael
"And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]",Jim
[hears a taxi honking] Oh shoot! That's my cab.,Michael
Alright.,Jim
Alright.,Michael
"Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...",Jim
"I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?",Michael
"[shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.",Jim
I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.,Michael
[chuckles] You got it.,Jim
Okay... [crosses Jim off his list] Phyllis.,Michael
"Oh no, they're still not done.",Phyllis
"No no no, let me see. [picks up the mostly knitted mittens] Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em. [waves goodbye to her with the mittens] [Michael begins walking out the office, he takes one last look at all his friends to see them working, and Jim looking back, teary eyed]",Michael
[drinking from Michael's World's Best Boss mug] See ya tomorrow boss!,Creed
Later guys. [leaves the office],Michael
"Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now. [you see video of Michael getting into the cab, and driving off. As the cab leaves, Pam drives in] She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. [You see Michael getting out and entering the airport, and going through security] I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?",Michael
"[putting his shoes back on, talking to the camera crew] Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh! [pulls out his mic from his shirt] This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. [he hands them the body mic, when he speaks it is inaudible now] That's what she said! [waves goodbye and walks off to his gate, halfway there Pam comes running up to him and they hug for a while. They say their goodbyes to each other, and Michael walks off for good]",Michael
"[watching Michael's plane take off. Crying and has smeared make up on] No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.",Pam
"[all are in the conference room for Michael's party. Michael isn't there. Jim gives the camera a knowing look] Well if he's not gonna make it at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. [Kevin nods] I for one love the corners. [cuts a corner piece, picks it up with his bare hands, and takes a bite] Why'd I just do that? It's not even that good. I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. [throws the piece in the garbage] No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. [grabs a piece from another corner. The office groans] What am I doing? [chucks it into the trashcan] Come on DeAngelo! [DeAngelo tries to lick the cake, everybody yells no]",DeAngelo
"[to Jim] Uh oh... [Jim, tearful, nods]",Dwight
"So, coasting time is officially over. Big changes are comin', and they're comin' fast. If you don't like 'em, this is called a door. You can walk right through it. Alright. I'm not here to be your friend. I like my life outside of this place. I live to leave at 5. Change number one: Darryl. Per your request, the company is sending you to business school at night. Full ride. Deal with it.",Deangelo
Seriously?,Darryl
Stone cold seriously.,Deangelo
"They are trying to figure me out. And I don't like it. Once they figure me out, they start to tell me what I want to hear. And I need to quickly figure out who's a good worker and who is simply a good mind reader. Because as soon as I'm hearing what I want to hear, I'm not gonna care.",Deangelo
"Change two, Toby, you're gettin' a new chair.",Deangelo
Thanks.,Toby
"Don't thank me! Hey, don't thank me, guy! Okay? And I don't care if you like it.",Deangelo
"These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?",Oscar
"I don't care what your favorite flavor is. Here's a bowl of ice cream. You either like it or you don't. [Andy nods] That's my attitude right now in this room, that's my attitude on Ice Cream Thursdays. Alright? Clear? Any questions?",Deangelo
This all sounds great to me. [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they're bad. I don't know what to think.,Kevin
"That is a s-- astute observation, Kevin.",Deangelo
Kev's got me pegged. [chuckles],Deangelo
It blows away Vermont in the fall.,Deangelo
"Snap, for real?",Darryl
"Good morning, Deangelo.",Pam
Hold on.,Deangelo
Okay.,Pam
"[continuing to talk to Darryl] And if you're really serious, you should go in the spring.",Deangelo
Because of the flowers.,Pam
No. Because the entire state smells like Earth.,Deangelo
"Dogwoods, or just the Earth.",Pam
"Yes, Pam.",Deangelo
"Hey, well, good morning. I think I have good news for you today. I found your new executive assistant. My friend Carla. [looking at resume] She's got great experience. We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume.",Pam
Put it with the rest.,Deangelo
Okay.,Pam
[entering his office] Hey dudes!,Deangelo
Hey!,Jim
Hey!,Andy
"Oh my God, he hates me!",Pam
No he doesn't. You just get so nervous and hyper around him.,Jim
I know.,Pam
"Every time there's a silence, your brain's like 'Heh-heh-huh-huh' [imitating crying].",Jim
Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?,Pam
Careful. There is no inner circle.,Jim
"Oh, there's an inner circle. Oh yeah.",Andy
"There is no inner circle. Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.",Jim
"Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle. I also say that because I am also in the inner circle. Did you get that, Ma? Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle! [thinks] Which doesn't exist.",Kevin
[holding two cups of coffee] There he is! Got ya coffee. [offers cup to Dwight],Deangelo
"Oh, wow, thank you. That was so kind of you. [throws cup in the garbage]",Dwight
"Not a coffee guy, I take it.",Deangelo
"It's just that I own the coffee shop. So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.",Dwight
Listen. I've got a sixer. 'Automatic for the People' on the jukebox. Let's hit the park after sundown. Come on! Pick up some sausage if you want.,Deangelo
I think you'll find what you're looking for [points toward Oscar] over there.,Dwight
"No matter how many times I reach out to Dwight, he doesn't seem to want anything to do with me. It reminds me of my relationship with my son. Except there, I'm the Dwight.",Deangelo
"Who's the biggest client in the state? I say we go get 'em, whatever it takes. Huh? What do you guys say?",Deangelo
Yes!,Kevin
"Right! Or my other idea, 50,000 tiny clients.",Deangelo
"Yeah, I say we just go for it!",Kevin
"[shoots mini basketball at hoop on office door, misses badly] Is that ball lighter than usual? Is that a Chinatown knockoff?",Deangelo
"That's Toys R Us, I think.",Jim
"No, that's definitely a knockoff. You can feel the center of gravity's off. Feel that. [throws ball to Gabe] What do you think?",Deangelo
"[holding ball in open palm] Oh, yeah, totally. Jim, you got ripped off big time.",Gabe
[calling for the ball] Deangelo! [shoots and makes it] See what I did there? That's what you need to do. [makes shooting gesture] It's that little English. The British are coming.,Deangelo
Yes.,Kevin
Deangelo's open!,Deangelo
"Hey Ry. Your department's killing it, baby. [puts arm around Ryan]",Deangelo
"Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure.",Ryan
Keep it up.,Deangelo
"The problem with having 'It' or 'the X-factor' or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table. So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor. It's not even that much of a stretch. She pretty much does whatever I say.",Ryan
What?,Kelly
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...",Ryan
Why should I pretend that you are my boss?,Kelly
"Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly? I'll tell you what I would have done for you. I'd lie for you.",Ryan
"Yeah, but you lie all the time. You lie for no reason. Ryan, you just like to lie.",Kelly
I'd die for you too.,Ryan
You really would?,Kelly
"[hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!",Ryan
"Sure thing, Mr. Howard.",Kelly
Woo. Glad he's not my boss.,Deangelo
[whispers to Kelly] You're the best. Thank you.,Ryan
You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name. So I've never had to buy it. True story. I just drink my cousin's.,Deangelo
Congratulations on your one cousin. I have seventy. Each one better than the last.,Dwight
"You know what... straight up, why don't you like me?",Deangelo
"I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here. Okay? I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it. Okay?",Dwight
Ohhhh no.,Deangelo
What?,Dwight
Okay? I'm gonna win you over.,Deangelo
No you're not.,Dwight
Yes I am.,Deangelo
No.,Dwight
Oh yes.,Deangelo
No.,Dwight
Yes.,Deangelo
No.,Dwight
Yes.,Deangelo
No.,Dwight
Yes.,Deangelo
No.,Dwight
Yes.,Deangelo
No.,Dwight
Yes. Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes [starts to run out of the break room] yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes!,Deangelo
"[looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled 'administrative' and 'assistant.'",Jim
"The winner: under 'Special Skills,' Mr. Don Feiner put 'Juggling.' [laughter]",Darryl
"What's wrong with juggling, Darryl? I'm a big juggler. I actually perform a motivational juggling routine.",Deangelo
Seriously?,Jim
"Oh yeah. I'd do it for you here, but uh, what would you say this room is, 300 square feet? 320?",Deangelo
320. Just freeballin' it.,Gabe
"It's a little cramped. How many square feet out there? 17, 18 hundo?",Deangelo
"Oh, I think it's 18 hundo.",Kevin
Give or take. [Deangelo walks out],Gabe
Sorry gang. Thought my juggling stuff was in the trunk of my car. It's not.,Deangelo
"Oh no, do you think it was stolen?",Pam
"I gotcha covered, boss. Used to play with the parabolas myself. [opens desk drawer and takes out balls] Got some extra balls! [throws them toward Deangelo, who dodges them] Hey-hey-hey-ho!",Andy
"Sorry, I never touch another juggler's instruments. You know, we're all here, I've got the music cued, why don't I just do my routine without the juggling balls? [starts to play 'Wake Me Up Inside' by Evanescence] Prepare... to go into the danger zone. [begins pretend juggling routine]",Deangelo
"Oh wow, you weren't kidding.",Pam
"No. Never. Can someone please throw me a fifth ball? If you dare! [Kevin pretends to throw ball] Incoming! And we're on! Remember, nothing's impossible! Phyllis, where's Phyllis?",Deangelo
[raises hand] Here.,Phyllis
"Do you believe in me, Phyllis?",Deangelo
Yeah.,Phyllis
Because I believe in you.,Deangelo
Okay.,Phyllis
"[pretending to bounce balls off Phyllis at close range] Feel that connection? Don't move your head. Please. Thank you. Oh! Big hand for Phyllis! [clapping] That took a lot of guts! [finishes routine] Ho! I'm Deangelo Vickers, thank you so much, hope you learned something.",Deangelo
Didn't drop a single ball!,Kevin
[imitating Deangelo's pretend juggling routine] Look. I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls. I'm juggling with one hand. No hands.,Pam
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?,Jim
What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him?,Pam
He's good at his job. And I like working for him.,Jim
"Of course you do, Jim. You're a man. Deangelo is a huge sexist.",Angela
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell. I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell. And I wrote my own companion piece to the 'Vagina Monologues' called the 'Penis Apologies.' So I know a thing or two.",Andy
"Okay. Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin? What about Pam and Kelly? Also department heads. But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?",Angela
How could I not see it? You're so right.,Andy
[to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?,Pam
"And say what? 'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'",Jim
Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?,Pam
Mmm-hmm.,Jim
"And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye. Snip snip. Am I right, girls?",Andy
"Hey, you got a second?",Jim
"Yeah, I got tons of time. This job's a joke.",Deangelo
So what's up?,Deangelo
"Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --",Jim
"[opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in. We meeting?",Darryl
"Yeah sure. Let's make it a meeting. [Darryl, Kevin, Gabe enter office]",Deangelo
"If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --",Jim
"What's the big secret? Why are you even whispering? Come on, it's the guys!",Deangelo
"I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand] Just the guys. Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem. I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads. Uh, some of the female department heads.",Jim
Uh-oh. Right?,Deangelo
Hot!,Kevin
"Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --",Jim
Damn!,Darryl
Whoa. Whoa. Wait.,Jim
Are you serious? Who feels this way?,Deangelo
Oh. Like nobody.,Jim
"Umm, Pam?",Gabe
It was --,Jim
Was it Pam?,Gabe
"That sounds like Pam. You know how she gets. Deangelo, she can get really bitchy. [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin...",Kevin
"Guys. Hold on. Doesn't matter who, okay? I'm just happy that Jim brought it to my attention because honestly, I had - I had no idea.",Deangelo
That's awesome.,Jim
Thank you.,Deangelo
"[on phone] Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight. No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time. He won't ever stand us up again.",Kelly
[joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.,Ryan
When Deangelo's around.,Kelly
And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --,Ryan
All the time.,Kelly
All the time.,Ryan
"Erin, do you mind running down to the lobby and bringing up my brand new executive assistant?",Deangelo
Absolutely.,Erin
"Hey, who'd you end up hiring?",Jim
"Oh, I'm glad you asked, Jim. Because apparently there's a rumor running around here that I am a sexist. I can't work here effectively if you guys think I'm something that I am not. I am not a sexist. Raise your hand if you have a vagina. [Deangelo raises hand, Kelly and Pam sheepishly raise hands] Raise your hand if someone you love has a vagina. [Deangelo raises other hand, along with rest of office] Yeah, yeah. Okay. Just about everyone. What about Deangelo's hand? Oh wow. He's got 'em both up. [Ryan raises both hands] Yeah. Uh huh. [others raise both hands] Yeah, so it bothers me when I hear that there's gossip around here that I treat women lesser than men. Okay? Frankly, we all look a little ridiculous when that happens.",Deangelo
"I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.",Phyllis
"Dwight, what's your take?",Deangelo
"What's the argument here? NBA, WNBA. One is a sport, one is a joke. I love sports, I love jokes. Room for all.",Dwight
"Man, you're smart. [Erin arrives with new executive assistant] Oh, hey! Hi! Hello. Welcome. Uh, everyone, I'd like you to please welcome Jordan Garfield. This is everyone.",Deangelo
Hello.,Jordan
"So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before? Uh, a law office?",Pam
"No, Anthropology. We don't have this in that size, pretty lame.",Jordan
Lame? You worked at Anthropology?,Kelly
Yeah.,Jordan
That's like my dream job. How did you even get that job?,Kelly
"Well, I umm -",Jordan
You chose this job over that job?,Kelly
"Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.",Ryan
"So, umm, is this your first office job then?",Pam
Yeah.,Jordan
Yup.,Deangelo
Wow.,Pam
No corporate experience whatsoever. I didn't want anyone with any bad habits.,Deangelo
"[heading into Deangelo's office] Jim, you coming?",Kevin
"Oh yeah, did he text us?",Jim
Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates],Kevin
[holds up phone and looks into Deangelo's office] No!,Dwight
"Jim, what are you doing? Get in there. This is not the time to take a stand. At least he likes one of us.",Pam
He didn't text me. [Andy's phone chimes],Jim
Yes! I'm in.,Andy
"Andy, what are you doing?",Angela
"I'm going in, into the belly of the beast. Gonna infiltrate and change from within. [joins the group in Deangelo's office] What's up, mancave! [makes barking noises]",Andy
"[to Jim] Just go in. Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.",Pam
"Internally, for office use [Jim quietly enters Deangelo's office and sits down] where do we get our paper from? Do we go -",Deangelo
"[to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.",Jim
[staring at Jim] Hey Jim.,Deangelo
Yeah.,Jim
Can I help you?,Deangelo
Nope. Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office],Jim
"So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?",Dwight
"Well, there is no inner...circle.",Jim
Dwight? Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I can help you with.,Jordan
Really? Anything.,Dwight
Do you need anything?,Jordan
"Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.",Dwight
"Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief. Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market. Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week. Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project. Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --",Andy
So this is my life. Until I win the lottery [laughs]. Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.,Jim
"So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods. And she becomes...The Horse Flyer.",Pam
"Hey! Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck! Okay? We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.",Ryan
No one likes a money grubber.,Deangelo
"I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money. I can't do this. I can't do this. I'm sorry. I just can't do it. Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss. Okay? Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.",Kelly
Ohh.,Deangelo
"Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly.",Ryan
"No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo. He's like Rango. He doesn't work here, basically. Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals. It was just a big misunderstanding.",Kelly
"Is this true, Ryan?",Deangelo
I did not see Rango.,Ryan
"Okay, I don't have time for this he said-she said.",Deangelo
He's not saying anything!,Kelly
It's too murky. I like Ryan. You seem kind of hysterical to me. Ryan's your supervisor. Let's just leave it that way.,Deangelo
"That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti-- [Deangelo walks away]",Kelly
"[sighs] Oh, close call! Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.",Ryan
"[knocking on door to Deangelo's office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey! It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?",Pam
"Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself.",Gabe
"[chuckles] Oh, you mean Michael Jordan?",Deangelo
[laughs] Total brain burp.,Gabe
I'm no MJ. I can do his dunk. From the free throw line.,Deangelo
Whoa.,Kevin
Daaamn! Mad respect for my brotha!,Darryl
"The man is paying me to take Chinese. I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.",Darryl
"Okay, well it's just really loud.",Pam
"Okay. We'll keep that in mind. Alright, ladies, back to the game.",Deangelo
Do it!,Darryl
Jim! Come on in.,Deangelo
You're back in.,Pam
"You know what? Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition? I'd love to see that dunk of yours.",Jim
"Yeah, we'll set that up one day.",Deangelo
"Today. Now, maybe. 'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.",Jim
"Yeah, I don't know.",Deangelo
Why not?,Jim
Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff. [laughter] Let's go downstairs! Okay? Let's do it.,Deangelo
"Pass. If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.",Dwight
"Damn it, Dwight! Enough! Get your ass downstairs or find a new place to sell paper! [Dwight immediately gets up and walks out]",Deangelo
"Okay, a little about me. I respond to strong leadership.",Dwight
"Alright, there you go.",Jim
"Seems a little close, you sure that's the real foul line?",Deangelo
"15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?",Jim
"Nah, that's 15. Yeah.",Deangelo
Okay.,Jim
"And uh, you know what, to make it interesting, Jordan, why don't you sit underneath the basket?",Deangelo
Seriously?,Jordan
"Yeah, come on. I'll dunk over you. Best seat in the house.",Deangelo
"I don't, I don't think I can do that. I'm holding your jewelry.",Jordan
"Right. Yeah. Okay, fair enough. Kevin, you do it.",Deangelo
Yes! Okay. [sits down in front of basket],Kevin
Someone want to sit in Kevin's lap? Angela?,Deangelo
No.,Angela
Oscar?,Deangelo
No thank you.,Oscar
"Okay, Jimmy, this is for you. Show you that anything is possible.",Deangelo
Fantastic.,Jim
Alright?,Deangelo
Yup.,Jim
"This is also for the troops. [backs up, bounces ball, starts running, jumps, lands in front of Kevin, jumps again, pulls himself up by the net, dunks ball, hangs on rim] Doctor is in! [hoop starts to fall] Ahhhh! [hoop crashes down on Deangelo]",Deangelo
[ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?,Jim
[Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo?,Erin
[speaking gibberish] Tablab.,Deangelo
"Oh my God, are you alright? Erin, will you call 911 please?",Jim
Who should I say is calling?,Erin
Erin.,Jim
[lots of gibberish] says to bartender [lots more gibberish] Droswip. Droswip.,Deangelo
"Droswip, yeah. I get it. Okay, we're gonna get you to the restroom.",Gabe
We could get Deangelo flowers.,Pam
"No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.",Dwight
That's true.,Phyllis
"All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]",Jim
"Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]",Dwight
Nope. Baskets have it.,Jim
"So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.",Jim
"[on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.",Jim
"[on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]",Dwight
Wait...,Jim
What have you done?,Pam
Mose... you'll never guess where I am right now.,Dwight [on phone]
Aaaaahhhhh!,Mose [on phone]
Can't stay there all day.,Pam
I'm coming.,Jim
Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?,Pam
You'd slow me down.,Jim
"Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.",Jim
Stop stalling! Come on.,Pam
"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation...",All
...under God...,All but Oscar
"...indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [Kevin finishes behind the rest of the group]",All
Amen.,Angela
"Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.",Dwight
"Ooh, about what?",Erin
That's on a need-to-know basis.,Dwight
I thought I needed to know for your calendar.,Erin
"[quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.",Dwight
"Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?",Jim
Define foment.,Dwight
You define foment.,Jim
[clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.,Dwight
[surprising Kelly] Aha!,Dwight
"Oh my God, what is wrong with you?",Kelly
Gotcha! Why are you late?,Dwight
"It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.",Kelly
"All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]",Dwight
"In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so...",Andy
Oh! Darryl's funny.,Erin
"I know, right?",Andy
"Hey, Andy?",Gabe
Yeah?,Andy
Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?,Gabe
Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe],Andy
Are you still in love with Erin?,Gabe
What?,Andy
"Because I am. I need to get her back. [crying] I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?",Gabe
"No, this is horrifying.",Andy
"No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?",Gabe
"We're just friends, okay?",Andy
Do you promise that?,Gabe
"Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?",Andy
"No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying.",Gabe
"[seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?",Dwight
"Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.",Jim
You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?,Dwight
"Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]",Jim
"Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.",Dwight
"And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it. [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]",Jim
[inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One...,Kevin
[refills his coffee near a sign that reads 'Honor System: $0.50' with a camera pointed at it],Stanley
"Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site]",Andy
I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.,Dwight
[looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!,Kevin
He put some snacks in the freezer for us.,Creed
You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?,Pam
No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch.,Creed
He means the ice pack.,Phyllis
[on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - [Gabe ends the call],Erin
I'm sorry. This can't wait.,Gabe
He's just gonna call back.,Erin
"Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God. [Erin and Angela both look taken aback]",Gabe
[quietly] What?,Erin
"Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. [Erin looks shocked] Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief [phone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [phone continues ringing] out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail?",Gabe
Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.,Erin
Well... it's just... [ringing] it messes up my rhythm.,Gabe
"I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.",Erin
"Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.",Jim
"Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.",Dwight
And the desk.,Jim
"The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.",Dwight
Okay.,Jim
Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.,Dwight
"I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...",Jim
Don't make me fire you.,Dwight
You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.,Jim
Don't make me pre-fire you.,Dwight
You wouldn't dare.,Jim
"Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.",Dwight
"[quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.",Jim
What?,Dwight
"If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.",Jim
"How you doing, Jordan?",Dwight
I'm good.,Jordan
"Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.",Dwight
Why are you telling me this?,Jordan
"Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster.",Dwight
"[walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [grunts] Ohh... [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day.",Dwight
"Dwight, are you carrying a gun?",Pam
"The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.",Dwight
"Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.",Andy
"The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.",Dwight
Why do you need to wear the holster at all?,Pam
Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?,Dwight
Thank you.,Angela
You could put your cell phone in it instead.,Phyllis
Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt],Dwight
You could put a banana in it.,Kevin
Why would I put a banana in my holster?,Dwight
"In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.",Kevin
"Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.",Pam
"Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]",Dwight
Andy!,Erin
Aah! Aah! It's so loud!,Andy
My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?,Oscar
[trying to find a pitch] Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.,Andy
"Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-",Meredith
"Hey, what happened?",Toby
"Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.",Kelly
"No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.",Dwight
[scatting off-key] Something's definitely wrong.,Andy
I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?,Oscar
"Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.",Angela
[buzzer to indicate a blocked site] Firewall.,Oscar
I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.,Gabe
"Okay, why are you calling Jo?",Dwight
I think I should go the hospital.,Andy
I'll go with you.,Erin
No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.,Gabe
I'll take him.,Darryl
"Thank you, Darryl. [Andy limps out of his chair and leans on Darryl for support]",Andy
What's wrong with you?,Darryl
It's my ear.,Andy
Yeah.,Darryl
"Okay, sorry.",Andy
"[excitedly] Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before.",Toby
I'm gonna keep trying Jo.,Gabe
"Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!",Dwight
"[enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- [removes hat] I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.",Dwight
We all saw you do it.,Stanley
Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?,Dwight
Navy blue. Little red anchors.,Erin
I have no way of knowing if that's true.,Dwight
I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands],Toby
"Okay, really?",Dwight
Would you consider this a terrorist incident?,Toby
I felt terrorized.,Ryan
Come on.,Dwight
"Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that.",Toby
"I just really, really think we should handle this internally.",Dwight
"Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?",Ryan
"Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.",Dwight
Hey. [Erin gasps] We're back.,Andy
"There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.",Dwight
"Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.",Andy
Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.,Dwight
Yeah.,Andy
How's your hearing?,Phyllis
Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.,Andy
"I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.",Darryl
"Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.",Kelly
American Idol? What? No.,Dwight
Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?,Kelly
No.,Dwight
[singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?,Kelly
"Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.",Dwight
"Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.",Phyllis
Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.,Angela
Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.,Kevin
I put everything back in the vending machine.,Dwight
Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.,Kevin
You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.,Pam
Okay.,Dwight
"Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.",Jim
Thank God.,Dwight
"Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in 'Shagadelic, baby,' at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?",Jim
What's jazz hands?,Dwight
[quickly shakes his hands back and forth],Jim
Fine.,Dwight
[leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet],Dwight
"[after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...",Kevin
"Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers.",Jo
"Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?",Dwight
Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert - the only man that ever turned me down.,Jo
"Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?",Jim
"Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic. [Jim coughs]",Jo
"[does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.",Dwight
We have to clean this up now!,Andy
She had so much -,Erin
"Hey, guys.",Gabe
Hey.,Erin
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.,Gabe
No! [Erin and Andy laugh],Andy
"Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?",Gabe
Uh...,Andy
I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.,Gabe
"Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...",Andy
"No, I was not.",Gabe
And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.,Andy
"Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?",Dwight
"Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage.",Kevin
"No, Kevin, come on.",Dwight
"My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it.",Kevin
"Kevin, not now.",Dwight
"Hey, Jo!",Kevin
"Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]",Dwight
"No, under the jacket.",Kevin
"You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.",Dwight
I don't feel anything.,Kevin
"Oh, it's so wet.",Dwight
"Push harder, Dwight.",Kevin
I can't. I can't push harder!,Dwight
"Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]",Kevin
"Okay, how's that?",Dwight
Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.,Kevin
I'm kneading it!,Dwight
Don't eat it.,Kevin
"Dwight! Walk me out. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - it's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel?",Jo
Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.,Dwight
What?!,Jo
"I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -",Dwight
Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It's not even in the same - you shot a gun? What is wrong with you?,Jo
"It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.",Dwight
Beaumont-Adams is a girl's gun. That just makes it plain stupid.,Jo
I take full responsibility.,Dwight
Who else would be responsible?,Jo
Pam made me put a banana in my holster.,Dwight
You shot a gun off -,Pam
Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.,Dwight
"Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius.",Jo
Got it.,Dwight
"I love you, Dwight. But you don't fit this job.",Jo
"[on the verge of tears] Jo, please... I will -",Dwight
"No, child. No. It's over. Now I gotta find a replacement for my replacement.",Jo
You three are my search committee. You're in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty?,Jo
Yep.,Gabe
Yep.,Jim
"Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office?",Jo
"Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority.",Toby
Who is it?,Jo
"Hey, Dwight. What's up?",Jim
Shut up.,Dwight
"Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]",Jim
"[giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...",Angela
Another one?,Kevin

"[drives up to the entrance of the building, his license plate reads 'NEW MGR'] It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton. [gets out of car, tosses his keys toward a nonexistent valet parker] Keep it running.",Creed
Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate. [slowly getting more excited] I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.,Creed
[to Jordan] Find out what language this is. [speaking in strange language],Creed
"[running a meeting in the conference room] Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, [camera switches to show only Meredith and Kevin have attended the meeting, Jim walks by and sees this] and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed...",Creed
He never called a meeting.,Jim
"[pointing at a whiteboard with BOBODDY written on the left side, vertically] BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first 'B' stand for?",Creed
What are we doing?,Pam
We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first 'B' stand for?,Creed
Um... Business!,Kevin
"I like it! Business! Good, Kevin! [writes after the first B, I, Z, N, U...] All right! The 'O'...",Creed
We need a new manager.,Pam
[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?,Jim
"Absolutely--I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits.",Fred Henry
Really?,Jim
Yeah.,Fred
[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?,Jim
Nice try.,Fred
"I'm sorry, what is your three-step plan?",Toby
"Well, I mean, I can't just hand you my plan. I mean, if you guys give me the job, then, then you'll get the plan.",Fred
"Well... it's an interview, and we don't know that you really have the plan.",Gabe
"[speaking faster] Well, I'm not gonna just make up that I have a plan. I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it. You're in paper, right?",Fred
"How would we know that, if you don't...",Gabe
You could just be saying it to get the job.,Jim
"I guess I could be, if I was... who would do that?",Fred
"How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.",Jim
Tell you what. I'll give you part three of part two. Not gonna give you a whole part.,Fred
Okay.,Jim
"Color-code sent documents, TM.",Fred
Did you just trademark that...,Jim
[confused] W-What?,Toby
That's a verbal trademark. That's an agreement.,Fred
"We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an 'Andy for Manager?' pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.",Jim
"[in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.",Stanley
Good morning.,Darryl
[also to Darryl] Good morning.,Phyllis
Good morning.,Darryl
Did you have a nice drive in?,Phyllis
I did.,Darryl
"I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!",Darryl
[puts up a poster in the break room with 'IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY' on it in bold lettering],Andy
[commenting on the poster] It's good. I really hope you get it!,Erin
"The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.",Andy
"Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.",Erin
Don't even... [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!!,Andy
You in the boss's chair!,Erin
EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.,Andy
"In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... [awkwardly smiling] we'll see what Rosa comes back with.",Andy
[checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?,Erin
"Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]",Phyllis
It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.,Phyllis
"So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...",Erin
"But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.",Phyllis
Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.,Erin
Mm.,Phyllis
But why not find out.,Erin
Yeah.,Phyllis
"[to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?",Pam
"They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.",Dwight
Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?,Pam
Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.,Dwight
Can you do any better on salary?,Warren Buffett
"Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.",Jim
"What about mileage when I use my car? I mean, gas ain't cheap, you know.",Warren
Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.,Jim
"How about 27? And uh, when I make long-distance calls, will they be monitored or is it on the honor system?",Warren
"[on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.",Angela
"The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.",Kevin
How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?,Toby
"You don't work in sales, do you.",Robert California
Uh... Human Resources.,Toby
"You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Don't be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don't ever think there is. There is only... sex. Everything... is sex. You understand that what I'm telling you is a universal truth,... Toby.",Robert
Yes.,Toby
"Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?",Gabe
Do I look like someone who would waste my own time?,Robert
No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim],Gabe
"Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?",Jim
"Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.",Robert
Yes.,Jim
"That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object... whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we've had already, you won't be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?",Robert
Yes.,Jim
"[more emphatically than Jim] Yes. You do. [nods at the Search Committee, then looks over at the camera with a smirk on his face]",Robert
"[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.",Jim
"[Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee] Good luck, Darryl.",Andy
[pats Andy on the back] Thank you.,Darryl
"Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.",Darryl
"[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.",Jim
So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up],Darryl
Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?,Gabe
Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!,Darryl
"So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?",Toby
I thought that was your job.,Darryl
"Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job.",Toby
"Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?",Jim
"I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]",Darryl
[noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that?,Darryl
"[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?",Jim
I... I just thought you knew me.,Darryl
"Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]",Jim
"Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]",Darryl
"[at the cafe on the first floor] Did, uh, you just interview?",Merv Bronte
"Ohh, unfortunately, yes.",Robert
What do you mean?,Merv
"That business can't attract anyone. It's awful up there. Those people seem like they're in prison, waiting out life sentences in a... dying industry.",Robert
Place must be horrible. I don't know if I want this job. [gets on elevator],Merv
"[in elevator] Well, if I get this job offer, and then I know that I'm gonna take it, and if I take it, I know that I'm never gonna quit, and then 25 years are gonna go by and... I'm gonna die here.",Merv
What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.,Dwight
I just did.,Robert
You can't.,Dwight
It's done.,Robert
"No, it's not.",Dwight
"I know you now, your nature. I'm done. Not worth continuing. [at the same time, Dwight says: You don't know me! Anything about me! Get out of my head!]",Robert
Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?,Dwight
I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street. [nods at Dwight mockingly],Robert
[standing up] Get out.,Dwight
"I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.",Dwight
"You guys pay for relocation, though, right?",Merv
"Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?",Toby
"Well, I'd want to move further away, you know? Just... I don't want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office.",Merv
Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?,Jim
"[pulls out a tupperware from his briefcase and takes out a tupperware] I'm leaving my other job because they were all jerks, really. [opens tupperware] You know, all of 'em. You had your jerk-wads, and your jerk-offs, so, just between the wads and the offs, I just... I had to get outta there. [begins eating sandwich]",Merv
Is this a bad time to be doing this?,Jim
I'm having a bad time. [chuckles],Merv
"I'm sorry, if we did something to upset you, I'm sure it was inadvertent.",Toby
"[continues to chew, slower and slower, appears confused] Wait.",Merv
"Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby? These are the nicest people I ever met.",Merv
[limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.,Angela
"[looking at an engagement ring on Angela's finger] It's gorgeous, Angela.",Pam
"Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.",Kelly
"[looks at ring, whispering] Wow...",Meredith
"It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?",Angela
Tell us the freaking story!,Meredith
Yeah! Tell us a story.,Kevin
"Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?",Angela
[laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?,Pam
"Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]",Angela
That's not accurate.,Pam
"Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]",Angela
"Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.",Oscar
Andy? You all set?,Jim
"Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.",Andy
Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.,Phyllis
[grunts] Augh.,Andy
"I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.",Erin
"So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?",Jim
"For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here... [gets cut off by Gabe]",Andy
Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.,Gabe
"I wasn't acc-, accusing...",Andy
"Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job.",Gabe
"Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone.",Andy
I didn't think you were.,Toby
"I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat, and I think he's responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,... he broke up the happiest couple in this office!",Gabe
How many windows are there in New York City?,Gabe
What?,Andy
"Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.",Gabe
Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?,Andy
No... How far away is the Sun?,Gabe
"[happily] Uh, 93 million miles.",Andy
[to Gabe] Is it?,Jim
"Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,...",Andy
"Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN! [slams fist, hurting his hand]",Gabe
"[alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!",Andy
"[on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say 'Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.",Darryl
"[on phone] First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business. [covers phone, whispers to Pam] Saving face. [uncovers phone] Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this]",Creed
How is this on me?,Pam
Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.,Pam
"[takes the pictures] Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.",Creed
They're the same picture.,Pam
"Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.",Kelly
"Your department's just you, right?",Jim
"Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.",Kelly
"Great! [to Jim and Toby] Um, can we just... [does a 'wrap it up' motion with his pen]",Gabe
What was that?,Kelly
"We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so... [nods]",Gabe
[getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?,Kelly
"What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?",Gabe
"I don't have any, assh***.",Kelly
"[comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.",Dwight
[walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?,Dwight
Good!,Jim
Good. They good?,Dwight
Yeah.,Jim
What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?,Dwight
Peepa.,Jim
"Peepa, how is she?",Dwight
Great.,Jim
"Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?",Dwight
No.,Jim
"Now, listen,...",Dwight
"You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.",Jim
"Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.",Dwight
[pulls Dwight's arm down] Okay. That's vivid.,Jim
"I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...",Dwight
Yikes.,Jim
Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.,Dwight
"Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]",Jim
Ha ha! [pats Jim on the back],Dwight
"Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?",Jim
"Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.",Dwight
Okay.,Jim
Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim],Dwight
Thank you.,Jim
Okay. [looks ashamed],Dwight
Pam... I think Robert is gay.,Oscar
"The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.",Pam
[whispers] So!?,Oscar
And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.,Pam
I have a very strong suspicion.,Oscar
Did you see him at a bathhouse?,Pam
What bathhouse?,Oscar
The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.,Pam
"[confused, whispers] What?",Oscar
Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.,Pam
My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.,Oscar
You're in the gay mafia.,Pam
"You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.",Oscar
"You guys, um, talking Senator?",Ryan
No.,Pam
No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?,Oscar
Cause he's totally gay? [walks away],Ryan
"Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.",Ryan
"[on video resume on a laptop] Name? David Brent. Occupation? Inspirer. Status? None of your business. Young, free, and single, though. Thanks for asking. Hear you're looking for a new boss. Yeah? Someone to tell a bunch of discontented, underencouraged drones what to do every day. Is that it? Oh. Our out-of-touch powers that be? Want me to fire them, if they don't see things your way? Then I ain't that dude. Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye. Get some other corporate suit to lay down the law. What? You've changed your mind? You're now looking for a leader of men? Ipso facto, women too. [points at self] When do I start? Yeah. [Jim looks uninterested in this candidate]",David Brent
"Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?",Phyllis
[trying to cut off Phyllis] I... I don't think I can do that.,Erin
Bestiality. Yeah.,Phyllis
"Well, that's not my personality.",Erin
If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle],Phyllis
Yes?,Erin
"I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.",Phyllis
I do really want him.,Erin
"So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim]",Darryl
Great.,Jim
Hope it's all right.,Darryl
I'm sure it's fine.,Jim
"The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?",Darryl
Howard Cline?,Jim
"Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about.",Darryl
[checks sheet] Oh... Deshaun Williams.,Jim
Yes. How did he do?,Darryl
He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...,Jim
Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.,Darryl
Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away],Jim
"First, I'll take down the cubicle walls.",Nellie Bertram
But there aren't...,Toby
"Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.",Nellie
A little un-specific.,Gabe
Everyone would be known for their accomplishments.,Nellie
"That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?",Jim
"Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them. [overlapping comments by the Search Committee] At least once a month, the lowest performing person... [does a cut-throat hand gesture] bye bye!",Nellie
"How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?",Gabe
"Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how.",Nellie
Okay.,Gabe
"By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle.",Nellie
I think that's probably all we need to hear from...,Jim
"Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor.",Nellie
That's very...,Jim
"You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee!",Nellie
"Okay, that's not gonna be...",Gabe
"Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go. [smiles]",Nellie
Is there a front runner?,Oscar
You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.,Jim
"Well, there must be someone who stands out.",Oscar
"No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.",Jim
Well...,Oscar
"The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.",Stanley
"[in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...",Ryan
"My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]",Stanley
Uh--,Jim
"You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life. [leaves]",Meredith
"Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.",Jim
Are you? [leaves],Oscar
"Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]",Ryan
"[walks in with her dogs] Gabe, honey! Oh, lord. Take all this. [gives the dog leashes and multiple bags to Gabe]",Jo
All right.,Gabe
Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning?,Jo
"No, was it good?",Jim
"Ohh, Robin was good. She's always good. Keeps him on his toes. Its Howard's show though. [picks up resume from Jim's desk] Whose is this? Darryl Philbin. Ohh. Very nice to see a familiar face on top. Ah... a little long aren't we? Four pages? Is this the same Darryl Philbin who's had two jobs in ten years at one company?",Jo
"Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.",Darryl
"Coordinated and implemented receipt storage and delivery of over 2.5 billion units of inventory. 2.5 billion, Darryl? 2.5 billion units of what?",Jo
"Paper material, ma'am.",Darryl
Paper material?,Jo
[softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes],Darryl
"[clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?",Dwight
Or what? You gonna shoot me?,Jo
"Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.",Dwight
I'll interview you right now.,Jo
Okay.,Dwight
Question 1. Ever shot a gun in the office?,Jo
It's complicated.,Dwight
"Yeah, but see... it's not.",Jo
I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.,Phyllis
I'm a woman. I would want to know.,Pam
"Yeah, you gotta know.",Meredith
"Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.",Kevin
"You have met a lesbian in real life, right?",Oscar
"You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.",Phyllis
She does seem happy.,Pam
You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.,Oscar
We don't tell her.,Kevin
Okay.,Pam
"Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?",Kelly
Okay.,Jo
"Uh,... can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don't worry, it's not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.",Kelly
"Welcome to Scranton, Jo. Land of a thousand problems only you can fix. [Jo's phone starts vibrating, she picks it up and sees Dwight has texted her 'Dwight's ability as a manager has lead him to higher levels of proffesional success,'] Oh for god's sake. He's texting me his resume one line at a time. These are costing me ten cents a piece, you jackass! I'm roaming!",Jo
"[to Jordan] Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant. [closes his office door]",Creed
Who is our biggest client?,Jordan
"Uh, just put him through to me.",Pam
[laughs] Okay.,Jordan
Hello! This is... the client.,Pam
"It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?",Creed
Yes.,Pam
"Hehehe, cool. Let's keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don't want you to be a dead mamma jamma.",Creed
Great.,Pam
"All right, thank you, bye-bye.",Creed
"Thank you, bye-bye.",Pam
"[knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.",Erin
Huh?,Jo
[motions toward her face] He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.,Erin
"No, send him in. [to Search Committee] Who is this?",Jo
I have no idea.,Gabe
"[seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. 'Soo-ven-yay.' Mr. 'Jacques Soo-ven-yay.' Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.",Jim
[mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager.,Dwight
Assistant to the Regional Manager.,Jim
[again] Assistant Regional Manager.,Dwight
What is it?,Jim
[in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.,Dwight
"Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.",Jim
I want to talk to Dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question. [Gabe gets up to leave] If he isn't here in sixty seconds...,Jo
Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.,Dwight
"[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]",Jim
[whispers] Yeah.,Dwight
[looks astonished] Ohhhh!,Jim
"Very unprofessional, 'Jacques.' Or, should I say, Dwight.",Gabe
Let's just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what?,Jo
"I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!",Dwight
All that for this job.,Jo
Yes.,Dwight
That's f***ing crazy. [Jo and Dwight both smile] Get outta here. [Dwight leaves] What a nutjob.,Jo
"This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'",Jim
"Okay, it's fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, who's got ya excited?",Jo
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.,Jim
Who's this fella? Went to Cornell. What's wrong with him?,Jo
How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability. [makes a 'zero' hand gesture],Gabe
And that's your unbiased opinion.,Jo
"Yes, it is.",Gabe
So it's not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you?,Jo
"Oh, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was...",Gabe
Gabe...ugh... you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Let's get you back to Florida. We'll figure out something for you.,Jo
That sounds like a promotion!,Gabe
It's not. Let's get Kelly in here to take his place.,Jo
Um... why Kelly?,Jim
Cause Gabe's tall and weak. She's short and strong. I'm doing an opposites thing.,Jo
Okay.,Jim
How'd my girl Nellie do?,Jo
"Oh, I didn't know you knew her?",Jim
She didn't mention it?,Jo
No.,Jim
Integrity move. I like it.,Jo
"You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.",Jim
"Well, I'm not saying you must hire her. If you find someone who's clearly a fit, then fine. Just make sure they fit real good. No more manager turnover. Don't mess this up, Jim. And give Dwight an interview. I like a little bit of crazy.",Jo
"[hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!",Erin
"Erin, what are you doing?",Oscar
I've been turned into a puppet!,Erin
Okay. [walks away],Oscar
"[giggling, walks to Erin's desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?",Kevin
I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!,Erin
"[giggles] Yeah. Low blow, puppet.",Kevin
And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.,Erin
"It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...",Kevin
[as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.,Erin
Silence?,Dwight
A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin's desk],Erin
"Hey, Erin.",Andy
[gets up] Oh.,Erin
Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?,Andy
[shrugs] I've done it all my life.,Erin
"Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.",Andy
"Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? [clip jumps ahead] Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... [clips jumps ahead] Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. [clip jumps ahead] I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though.",Andy
"[loudly] Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.",Angela
I'll get over it.,Stanley
"I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?",Angela
That was our dream wedding.,Pam
Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?,Angela
"[looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.",Pam
Hmm.,Angela
All right. Name.,Jim
Dwight Schrute.,Dwight
"Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.",Jim
You have to interview me...,Dwight
I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.,Jim
I demand more questions!,Dwight
"[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.",Jim
"Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.",Dwight
Yes.,Jim
"What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.",Dwight
"Thank you, Dwight.",Jim
"Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]",Dwight
"Well, that was quick.",Jim
"[sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.",Kelly
He's not a real candidate.,Jim
"I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.",Kelly
You took the deal.,Jim
"Yeah, it was a great deal.",Kelly
That's not okay.,Jim
"I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?",Kelly
"Well, we could try him out for a little while... [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in...",Toby
What is happening right now?,Jim
Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?,Phyllis
"No, why would you think that?",Jim
"He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.",Phyllis
"Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.",Jim
"That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.",Kelly
"No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.",Jim
"Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.",Dwight
Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.,Jim
Tuna... You're completely sane.,Andy
Thank you.,Jim
"Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?",Andy
"Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?",Jim
Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?,Kevin
[while sighing] I suppose I am.,Jim
Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...,Kevin
"I don't think he meant, that--",Oscar
So now anyone gets to talk at any times?,Kevin
Go ahead.,Oscar
"What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]",Kevin
Can I say...?,Oscar
Yes.,Jim
I think it should be Darryl.,Oscar
Okay.,Jim
What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.,Dwight
Kelly's on your side.,Oscar
"I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.",Kelly
"Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.",Andy
I want an outsider.,Ryan
Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-,Jim
"No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.",Ryan
A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.,Pam
"No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.",Ryan
"No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.",Pam
"Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?",Ryan
"I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.",Ryan
"I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.",Meredith
Hey! Hey! Hey!,Jim
"Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let's hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]",Meredith
She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.,Andy
[walks in] Gotta catch a plane.,Gabe
"Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.",Pam
"Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.",Gabe
You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.,Kelly
"Okay, you know what, you don't need to make that sound.",Gabe
I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!,Kelly
"There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.",Gabe
"Later, man.",Kevin
[various] Good luck! Goodbye! Good luck at your new job.,All
"Take care, man.",Ryan
"We're gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]",Dwight
"[stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes.",Andy
"I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I'm like...",Erin
"Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]",Phyllis
"No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]",Phyllis
"What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?",Jim
"Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-",Angela
"No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking]",Toby
Exactly.,Kevin
"[enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.",Darryl
"Daddy, are these the people who are making you manager?",Jada
"[sighs] Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.",Darryl
"I don't know if he'd be a good manager [Jim shakes his head and looks wide-eyed at Darryl], but he's a really great dad!",Jada
"Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]",Darryl
It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?,Phyllis
"What? No, no, it's not a vote.",Jim
Then what was this all about?,Phyllis
I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.,Jim
I don't care. They can just vote.,Kelly
"No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]",Jim
Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.,Andy
"This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend.",Nellie
"Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.",Darryl
"No, I've never been more sure of anything in my life. I will be the new boss of... [looks back to glance at lobby directory] Vance Refrigeration.",Fred
"Honestly, I think I... I sabotaged myself. It's like I'm afraid of being happy. Case in point... I was supposed to start another job today.",Merv
"[chuckles] I will get offered the job. That's a... call I've received many times. The slight hopefulness in their voice, the pregnant pause... while they wait to hear my response, and then... my response.",Robert
"[geeky voice] I want the job. I really do. It's just, the rest of my family's in the Finger Lakes right now. I'm supposed to be in the Finger Lakes right now. I told them I was on a hike; snuck away to do this interview. I gotta get back pretty soon; they'll worry. People disappear in the Finger Lakes.",Finger Lakes Guy
"I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]",Dwight
You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.,Creed
"[in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Is that right?",Pam
I think you two should meet.,Creed
"Well, okay!",Pam
Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together. [Pam puts down phone and picks it back up],Creed
[in a comedic male voice] Hello!,Pam as fourth-biggest client
"[in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Hello!",Pam as ninth-biggest client
"Hi, how are ya? [Erin looks amused, Stanley and Phyllis look at Pam, confused]",Pam as fourth-biggest client
"Ohho! I'm good! Don't you just love paper, and things about paper!",Pam as ninth-biggest client
"Hey, are you single? This seems like a love connection to me!",Pam as fourth-biggest client
It's Kismet!,Creed
"Oh, for God???s sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb]",Oscar
"Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That???s it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.",Oscar
"Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don???t.?? And I don???t.?? But I am so excited to be a part of it.",Erin
[exiting elevator] After you my good sir.,Andy
"No, I insist.",Dwight
I insist.,Andy
"The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California??? for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.?? He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don???t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.???? And he chose???",Jim
"[drumroll with hands] I??? it???s unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice???s first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, ???I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer.??? Smart, right?",Andy
(planking on top of cabinet] Very smart.,Kelly
"Uh, this has got to stop.",Andy
I can???t get down.,Kelly
K... Kevin! [Kevin planking on Dwight???s desk],Dwight
"Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I???ve got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I???ve added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I???m doin??? great.",Dwight
"K, I???m gonna need some help. Pam?",Dwight
I don???t think I should.,Pam
"Oh, yeah. Pregnant.",Jim
Right here. Little Michael Scott- [points to her belly],Pam
"No, I told you I don???t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.",Jim
Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.,Pam
"Look, it???s a ???Little Pregs??? [points to her belly] and ???Big Pregs??? [points to Pam???s]",Angela
"Wait, when did we start calling it that-",Pam
"Isn???t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?",Angela
"Well, I am a few months ahead of you.",Pam
"I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.",Angela
"Hoist him aloft. C???mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk]",Dwight
I???m lifting.,Darryl
"Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin??? much better. This soda. This is mine.",Darryl
"It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.",Stanley
"I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I???m telling someone how to do somethin???. I go on with a long description and then I say, ???and shove it up your butt.??? It???s stupid, but it???s my thing now.",Stanley
No one should be planking at all.,Jim
"Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?",Andy
Say no more.,Dwight
"[starts attacking plankers] Kids, don???t try planking. It???s dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] ???Specially with me around.",Dwight
"You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it???s just gonna make you cry?",Jim
"Because everything makes me cry, so what???s the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.",Pam
He???s got a bank vault. That???s a start.,Jim
Not enough though.,Pam
"The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he???s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it???s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It???s strange.",Jim
Here we go.,Erin
Hello.,Robert
Robert California. Let???s have a conversation.,Erin
Describe your day so far.,Robert
"Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-",Erin
"And when you recount your day, never say you woke up. It???s a waste of your time. That???s how every day???s begun, for everyone, since the dawn of man.",Robert
"Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I???ve been doing this thing-",Erin
"Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.",Andy
"First item on the agenda: can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don???t know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client.",Andy
"Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. [motions her over, both looking at Robert???s notebook]",Erin
Jim. [motions him over],Pam
[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?,Jim
The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts?,Andy
What are your thoughts.,Robert
"Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women???s soccer, no?",Andy
What are you looking at?,Dwight
"It???s, it???s nothing.",Jim
It can???t be nothing.,Dwight
"Yeah, it can???t be nothing.",Phyllis
"It???s just a list of our names, split into two columns.",Jim
What?,Stanley
"Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?",Jim
No.,Erin
"No. Okay. Um, I???ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?",Jim
"[throws hard, Jim doesn???t catch] Nice catch.",Dwight
"If he comes out, distract him. [takes list to copier]",Pam
We need a warning signal.,Kevin
"We don???t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-",Jim
We do.,Kevin
"I promise you, we don???t need a warning-",Jim
WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!,Kevin
Ahhh! [falls out of chair],Phyllis
Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?,Dwight
Yeah. Yeah. Oh.,Phyllis
"??? 2, 3! [pulls Phyllis up]",Dwight
Thanks guys.,Phyllis
"Okay, which side of the list am I on?",Dwight
Left.,Jim
Yes!,Dwight
Why are you- How do you know?,Jim
Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.,Andy
"Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert???s notebook.",Jim
He left it at reception and we photocopied it.,Pam
"Oh, okay. I don???t want any part of this.",Andy
Maybe it???s a list of people he???s gonna fire.,Pam
"Okay, it???s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.",Jim
This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here???s something. Who would eat who in an ???Alive??? situation. No... that can???t be it.,Dwight
"I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side???s the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.",Andy
I don???t think it???s-,Jim
???Scuse me?,Pam
"Shhh, Pam. C???mon, don???t be such a right-sider.",Dwight
Did you guys figure it out?,Angela
We couldn???t crack it.,Andy
Go in there and just ask the man what it means.,Stanley
He???ll know that we looked at his private notebook.,Andy
"C???mon, just say you saw the list by accident.",Phyllis
I???m already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it???s starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.,Andy
"Yeah, that???s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?",Phyllis
"[Andy continuously knocking on door] Yes, for god???s sake Andy. Yes, come in.",Robert
"What???s up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.",Andy
Great. Thank you.,Robert
And it was open. And people saw this. And they???re just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.,Andy
What is this?,Robert
It???s a photocopy from your notebook.,Andy
You read my notebook? And photocopied it. And distributed it.,Robert
No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.,Andy
"Ah, please. Here???s what it is. It???s a doodle.",Robert
What?,Andy
"Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. Don???t you think? Well, I doodle too, but I???m not an artist. So I draw words and lists.",Robert
"That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?",Andy
Might as well have been sketching a cube.,Robert
"Okay. Robert???s in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?",Andy
Maybe we???re s???posed to do it with people in our group.,Meredith
That???s not it.,Jim
People in the other group.,Meredith
"Mmum, still wrong.",Jim
"Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?",Andy
"Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ???em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!",Stanley
"Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.",Andy
I know! It???s alphabetical.,Kevin
[separately] No.,Everyone
"No, it???s not. Here???s how we find out. Let???s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let???s just size each other up here and left side of the list??? ATTACK!",Dwight
"Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling]",Jim
Dwight!,Andy
Hey!,Meredith
Warning! Warning! Warning!,Kevin
"[enters room, everyone quiets and separates] I???d like to invite the following people to join me for lunch: Jim, Dwight, Angela, Darryl, Kevin, Toby, Phyllis, Oscar.",Robert
That???s great. Let???s do this guys.,Dwight
"Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.",Jim
I love you so much. [starting to cry],Pam
Hey. It???s nothing. Alright? I???ll text you when we get there. Let you know what???s going on.,Jim
Okay. [turns to computer],Pam
Nope. No dog video.,Jim
Okay.,Pam
Okay. See you guys.,Jim
"Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!",Andy
"Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street?",Robert
"Uhhh, the street?",Jim
Sesame street.,Robert
"Oh, I didn???t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.",Jim
"Elmo, god???s sake, it???s the Elmo era.",Robert
Right.,Jim
Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn???t you agree.,Robert
"Yeah, she does like Elmo.",Jim
Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.,Oscar
Completely.,Phyllis
"Apt. Apt analysis, Robert.",Darryl
The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.,Kevin
"I should not be here. I???m in the- I was in the wrong- I???m- I???m sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here.",Toby
Great group! Pizza party!,Andy
How is this a pizza party?,Kelly
"Well, why don???t you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.",Andy
"Yeah, well, that???s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.",Kelly
Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?,Andy
What???s that?,Stanley
Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.,Andy
That???s pizza.,Stanley
That???s regular pizza.,Pam
"You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?",Dwight
I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you.,Robert
Okay!,Dwight
[separately] Awww.,Everyone
"Well, what about the other guys.",Phyllis
Losers.,Dwight
No.,Robert
C???mon.,Dwight
I don???t- I don???t wanna say-,Robert
"C???mon, c???mon.",Dwight
"No, no.",Robert
C???mon.,Dwight
"Ha, I guess I think they???re losers.",Robert
"Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!",Dwight
Probably shouldn???t have said that. [Jim???s jaw drops],Robert
Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.,Andy
"[Pam???s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Jim. ???This is getting very weird. Will explain later.???",Pam
"[Everyone???s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Kevin.",Pam
???Suck it losers.???,Meredith
"Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn???t the fact that I???m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!",Ryan
"I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, ???Who???s that receptionist? I like her.??? Now I???m just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you???re like, ???Oh, loser.???",Pam
"C???mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?",Andy
Oh. Oh God.,Pam
"[door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?",Kelly
It was excellent.,Angela
Good times.,Darryl
Yeah?,Andy
"Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it???s over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.",Dwight
"I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.",Kevin
"Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?",Jim
"Yeah, I???m fine.",Pam
[spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun] Loser. Losers. [Dwight holding up ???L??? to his forehead],Kevin
"[on the phone, while getting sprayed] Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It???ll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.",Meredith
"When I was a salesman I could just be like ???Not my job, not my prob. I???m going to the warehouse to polish my knob.??? Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.",Andy
"Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it???s really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let???s say top-tier and others would be second-tier.",Andy
I never said that.,Robert
"Thank you. Great.
Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you???re talking about?",Andy
"Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I???m thinking of. Can you clarify that?",Andy
"Let me tell you some things I find productive. Positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement. Honesty. I???ll tell you some things I find unproductive. Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues. And then, inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think you???re a winner. If I didn???t, I don???t. But I just met you all. Life is long, opinions change. Winners prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong.",Robert
"Whew, well. I guess that???s that.",Phyllis
"No. No, no.",Andy
"Andy, don???t go in there!",Erin
I???m going in there.,Andy
"I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don???t know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I???m not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.",Andy
"I???m not gonna change my list, Andy, and I don???t use ballpoint pens.",Robert
"Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he???s a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he???s hard to love, but did you know that he???s in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?",Andy
I did not know about the sales figures.,Robert
"Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word ???no??? not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I???m being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.",Andy
"Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.",Dwight
Shhh.,Jim
"Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.",Andy
I like my new group. I liked my old group.,Erin
Are we done?,Robert
"Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we???re gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.",Andy
You want a three and half day weekend for Columbus Day?,Robert
"Yes, I do.",Andy
And you are aware that Columbus and his legions committed genocide against an entire civilization of Native Americans.,Robert
I don???t care. [Robert smiles as Andy exits],Andy
"Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.",Andy
We get that every year.,Stanley
"Well, you got it this year too.",Andy
"Good night, Andy.",Phyllis
Night.,Andy
Bye.,Angela
Good night Andy.,Oscar
Good night.,Dwight
Night.,Andy
"Alright, I???m gonna go warm up the car.",Jim
"Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim?",Pam
"Okay, I know I???ve been crying easily today, but- [shows unfolded paper Jim dropped, shows two lists, ???Pam??? and ???Cece??? on one side, ???Everything else??? on the other] I mean, that???s just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it???s stupid. No. [starts crying] It???s wonderful. I???m gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.",Pam
"I gotta say, I think it's kinda cool not knowing. It's like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It's kinda sophisticated.",Andy
Everybody hates those endings!,Kelly
"[weepy] Yeah, I hate those endings.",Pam
I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.],Oscar
I was looking for patterns.,Kevin
I know.,Oscar
It's all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He's a genius. You guys just don't get him.,Ryan
"I made a list like this for Congress when I worked in Hollywood in the 50's, they're meaningless.",Creed
"Guys. Really, it's ok. Everyone has made a really solid first impression, I don't think there's any reason for anybody to worry.",Toby
"I am on the wrong side, and I am freaking out here.",Toby
"[grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk] Man, it's like hoisting a manatee. I can't get a grip it's so vast.",Dwight
Ryan? A little help?,Jim
God. How do whalers do it?,Dwight
"Here's the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.",Ryan
"Creed! Wha- [Shoves Creed with his foot, Creed grunts] This is a safety issue with you. There's no way to know if you're dead!",Andy
Good morning. [suitcase falls and he laughs awkwardly],Gabe
"Corporate wants me up here, Dunder Mifflin wants me down there. What they worked out is that Monday, Wednesday and Friday I'm here in Scranton, Tuesday Thursday I'm in Tallahassee, I mean I feel like Vera Farmiga in Up in the Air, you know? More money more problems. Although, I didn't get a raise, so you know. Same money, more problems.",Gabe
It's called owling. You'll read about it in like eight months.,Ryan
"Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.",Jim
That sounds good.,Robert
"Chicken piccata, side salad.",Kevin
"Chicken piccata, salad on the side please.",Darryl
"I'll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.",Oscar
"Chicken piccata, side salad.",Toby
"Side salad, chicken piccata on the side.",Angela
"I'll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.",Phyllis
Steak. Rare.,Dwight
"Jim, you alright? What are you doing?",Robert
Good. What? Nothin',Jim
Oh! Text from Jim. ???This is...??? hmm.,Pam
"Profound man, your husband.",Ryan
One more. To our boss!,Dwight
Hey!,All
I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole. [everyone clinks glasses],Jim
You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.,Dwight
I can expense it.,Robert
"Let him expense it, Dwight.",Darryl & Oscar
"I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?",Dwight
Thank you.,Robert
"Hi, Mr. Shrute. I've waited on you before. I just wanted to let you know that gratuity is not included in the bill and tips are expected.",Waiter
"Oh, tips are expected?",Dwight
Yes sir.,Waiter
"Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl....",Dwight
"My entire childhood, I was the one left out, and I said to myself: Gabe, if you just achieve some success, you'll be part of them. You'll be part of the happy ones. But instead, people just used my success as a new way to shut me out.",Gabe
"Hey, this ain't no Breakfast Club, bitch.",Meredith
Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!,Dwight
"Come on, man.",Jim
Winners!,Dwight
"Hey, so this isn???t matching up with this???and I???m not sure which one???s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?",Jim
Yes. Me do.,Kevin
Alright.,Jim
"Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?",Jim
Me do it now. Go. Stop worry.,Kevin
"Kevin, do you feel OK?",Pam
Me feel good. Body strong. Sleep big last night.,Kevin
"Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.",Pam
"Yeah, alright Kev why don???t you come with us?",Jim
"No, guys.",Oscar
"No, he???s fine.",Angela
He???s fine.,Oscar
He???s always been like that.,Angela
No he hasn???t.,Pam
"I mean, he???s gotten worse over the years???.",Angela
He???s making a statement. It???s an ironic comment on our expectations of him. A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.,Oscar
You keep think that.,Kevin
"Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say ???car no go???, and we best friends. So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?",Kevin
"Kevin, I appreciate what you???re trying to do.",Andy
Thank.,Kevin
"Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code. And what we???re talking about is???basically the speech equivalent??? to just wearing underpants. Sometimes words, you no need use???but need need for talk talk.",Andy
But save time. More success.,Kevin
Does it save time though? ???Cause we???ve been here for about an hour.,Jim
No me fault.,Kevin
"Kevin, at most you???re saving a microscopic amount of time.",Pam
Many small time make big time.,Kevin
What are you gonna do with all this time?,Andy
See world.,Kevin
"Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.",Pam
"K, Kevin, are you saying ???See the world???? or ???Sea World????",Jim
See world. Oceans. Fish. Jump. China.,Kevin
"No, see? Right there, that???s the problem with your method. ???Cause I still don???t know if you???re saying ???Sea World??? or ???see the world,??? and it???s taking a lot of time to explain it.",Jim
"Fine, fine. I???ll talk normally.",Kevin
"When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling] They see.",Kevin
This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet???.the Pyramid. [holds up triangle shaped touch pad],Dwight
"Ooh, why is it shaped like that?",Phyllis
"So, you can tell your clients: ???Unleash the power of the pyramid.???",Dwight
It???s huge. How much does it weigh?,Pam
"Oh no no no. Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it???s barely three pounds.",Dwight
How much memory does it have without the booster?,Ryan
Fifty L.,Dwight
"I???m sorry,??? L????",Ryan
How many L to a K?,Jim
You???re really going to want the booster.,Dwight
How on earth are we supposed to sell????,Stanley
I???ll take five.,Jim
"Andy, don???t make us sell this stupid thing.",Phyllis
"Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight???s meeting.",Andy
Thank you.,Dwight
"I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties???and tie clips. Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN?",Andy
??????C-SPAN????,Oscar
"Yeah. C-SPAN, cocker spaniel. Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause??????",Andy
Is this really the best use of our collective time?,Dwight
"I am still forming a first impression with Robert. Once it is formed, we can all relax. Ok, I???m sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog???had to pull rank.",Andy
"[to group] OK, let???s look at some ties.",Dwight
"Here???s how I???m going to help out from now on. I???m going to not care, and I???m going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy???s inevitable demise.",Dwight
[To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.,Dwight
"Um, D-Dog, you have a message.",Erin
"Erin, you don???t need to call him that.",Pam
"Andy wants us to, P-Dog.",Erin
"It???s ok E-Dog, just who called?",Darryl
Justine. She said she???s coming by later.,Erin
Your ex-wife?,Jim
"Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?",Kevin
No no no no. I like her.,Darryl
Well I???m just quoting you. I would never say that about her. I don???t know the woman.,Kevin
"Nah man, we get along now. Real well.",Darryl
Wow. Alright. Can???t wait to meet her.,Jim
I???ll introduce you.,Darryl
"Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose. But last night we put a lot of that to bed. I can???t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night???. I have to sing it. [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.",Darryl
[to Robert California] Hi Dad!...... Ahhh???.oh boy.,Andy
"Hello, Andy. Excellent tie.",Robert
Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you???re here?,Erin
I???d love some coffee.,Robert
"I was looking over your projections, and I think we can do better.",Robert
Are you factoring in the??? whole national ???economy???. declining and all that?,Andy
"Andy, do you know why I chose you?",Robert
I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor???.vanilla?,Andy
Vanilla? No no no no. You???ll never guess in a million billion years you???ll never guess.,Robert
You were saying you chose me???. There was a reason?,Andy
"Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set?",Robert
Can I inspire? [laughs] I don???t know!.....I don???t know.,Andy
Oh! Thank you. Uh???.,Robert
"Oh, sorry.",Erin
You can just put it down.,Robert
Oh,Erin
That is very cold.,Robert
Yeah. It???s old. [smiling],Erin
Why would I???..?,Robert
I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said ???coffee??????.,Erin
Why don???t we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this.,Andy
"Andy, you don???t want that.",Erin
I???ve been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. [sips] Mmm???.,Andy
Sorry.,Erin
You like her.,Robert
I do.,Andy
She likes you.,Robert
"You know, we???ve both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up. Now we???re in this weird dance???.",Andy
[interrupting] I???m afraid you???ve lost my interest.,Robert
Let me call you back.,Oscar
I gotta go.,Meredith
"If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here?",Robert
Ah???,Robert
This is where we go,Kevin
"[chuckling] Oh, you???d go someplace else. That???s not it, that???s not the answer.",Robert
It???s a answer.,Kevin
It???s a wrong answer.,Robert
There are no wrong answers.,Kevin
"Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it???s birth. Those superstores are terrified of us. Anybody know why?",Robert
Wait???.they???re terrified?,Phyllis
"Let me tell you how I buy something these days. I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price. Or I don???t know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me. The era of personal service is back. You are back. You???ll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them ???you are welcome.??? [Applause] Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people. Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen. Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it.",Robert
You got it.,Andy
Double.,Robert
Done.,Andy
I???m not kidding.,Robert
"Neither am I, it???s already done. Hah, I???m just kidding, it???s going to take some time.",Andy
Double.,Robert

"What???s up, guys? Just thought we???d have a little rap session, talk about business???see how things are going? Ahem???",Andy
Why don???t you start?,Jim
"If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert???man. What a boss. Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how???s the sales doubling ???project going?",Andy
"Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can???t just press a magic button.",Phyllis
OF course not. There???s no magic button. You have to summon that.,Andy
"If we could just double our sales, we already would have. You???re not making any sense.",Stanley
He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?,Jim
"Dwight, anything?",Andy
"We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they???re out of the house.",Dwight
"You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.",Andy
"New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door???",Jim
Fart???.. good Sesh. [gets up] That leg???s asleep.,Andy
Hello. I???m looking for Darryl Philbin?,Justine

D-Bone. There you are.,Andy
"Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie???? Lick the spoon?",Dwight
"No, that???s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about???",Andy
Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don???t see the point. It???s so Wall Street.,Dwight
"I know, right?",Andy
Right?,Dwight
"Yeah???um, how is everything?",Andy
Good. Really really good.,Dwight
Must be a tough time to be a family farm.,Andy
"Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.",Dwight
Oof. What are you gonna do about that?,Andy
"I don???t know, what do you mean?",Dwight
There???s gotta be some way you can double your beet sales???,Andy
"You wanted the job, the job is yours. Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I???ll do mine???.. walnuts?",Dwight
No!,Kevin
Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine],Angela
Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici???s favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.,Pam
"She looks at it when she???s on the potty, and she makes the faces.",Jim
Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?,Angela
I flipped through it.,Pam
So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you???re pregnant?,Angela
Of course.,Pam
We know that.,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk. Would you like to join me?,Angela
That sounds nice.,Pam
Great.[Angela walks away],Angela
You have a walking buddy.,Jim
I do.,Pam
Thanks for coming in guys.,Andy
"You don???t have to thank us for coming in, it???s our job.",Phyllis
Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I???m gonna thank people.,Andy
What???s with the blanket?,Meredith
This is what???s under the blanket.,Andy
We don???t get it.,Oscar
"These are incentives. It???s how we???re gonna double growth. Now, you???re probably all asking yourselves: ???Well, how does this work????",Andy
"Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.",Pam
You???re exactly right and you get a point.,Andy
Oh. [smiling],Pam
"Uh, is that a vibrator?",Ryan
Twenty points.,Andy
How does one get a point?,Meredith
"I???ve outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.",Andy
Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It???s so gross.,Kelly
"There???s lots of stuff. John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.",Andy
"How ???bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.",Stanley
I can???t.,Andy
This point system is really insulting.,Kelly
"Ooh I didn???t mean to offend you, and I hope you???ll forgive me because I am very very??? Sari. [tosses yellow print material over shoulder] Sixteen points.",Andy
That???s a tablecloth.,Kelly
What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?,Jim
That???s a crazy amount of points.,Andy
"But, what if?",Jim
"Well, what do you want?",Andy
"I don???t know, for such a crazy number I???d like something pretty crazy.",Jim
"Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work. [laughter]",Andy
"That???s pretty good. What about uh, for a thousand points?",Jim
"I???ll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. [laughter] Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard![Andy points to his rear-end]",Andy
Ooooh!,Group
Really?,Oscar
"Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?",Jim
"Swear to God, hope to die. Now let???s get to work!",Andy
"Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case???let???s get to work.",Jim
Yeah!,Dwight

Andrew.,Jim
Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?,Andy
"No, I didn???t notice anything.",Jim
Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years???.and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down. Now look at him.,Andy
[On the phone] You???ve got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!,Stanley
"I don???t know what to tell you, man.",Jim
You think it has something to do with that incentive program?,Andy
"Oh, one hundred percent. We all want to see you tattoo your ass.",Jim
Bah???I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.,Andy
"Nah, you definitely weren???t kidding. And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]",Jim
Hundred and twenty points.,Andy
"Yeah. Big sale. Don???t worry about it though, I don???t really care about the points. I would like a point receipt though???[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald???can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt]",Jim
Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman???s?,Pam
Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.],Erin
"[on the phone]and I???m back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?",Jim
Where???s Angela? [Hands paper over her shoulder],Pam
"Hey Kevin, what are you doing?",Andy
Don???t talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily],Kevin
"[on phone] Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of ???95. Hey there, um, I???m a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question. I may be missing a chapter here???De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale???uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I???m in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations. [laughs]",Andy
Took ???em one day.,Andy

Just need a second outside.,Andy
Gettin??? psyched up?,Jim

"Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this???",Jim
Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? ???.Confession: I don???t know what I???m doing.,Andy
"I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun???.and you did that.",Jim
"My ass is only so big, I mean I can???t do this everyday.",Andy
"But I think it???s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea???.which, by the way, I can???t wait for.",Jim
"No one expects me to go through with this, right?",Andy
Absolutely not.,Jim
Let???s ink???my stink! [crowd cheers],Andy

Just a few adjustments,Pam
"Alright, let???s begin.",Tattoo Artist
This is where I grin and be-YOW OW!,Andy

"Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I???m gonna like it.",Dwight
DRAW SOME BLOOD!,Dwight
AHHHHH!!!!!!!,Andy
"Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he???s all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him.",Robert
"[removes tape to reveal tattoo of puppy] It???s a Nard Dog! [group cheers] That???s my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!",Andy
Pull up your pants.,Jim
There???s something about an underdog that really inspires???the unexceptional.,Robert
"Um, what should we talk about?",Pam
"Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I???m having.",Angela
"Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.",Pam
"A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don???t know if I should call social services about it.",Angela
"Angela, that???s pretty transparently me.",Pam
Maybe.,Angela
You know it???s just herbal tea.,Pam
In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!,Angela

Fine.,Pam
"When you're a kid, you picture a pilot kinda like this [imitates plane noises while steering wildly] But then you learn that's crashing the plane. The right way to do it is more like this. [calmly pulls imaginary steering back and forth] Or better yet, like this. [takes hands off imaginary wheel] Now that I'm manager, I think about that a lot. I let Dwight run the meetings, I let good people do good work and I stay out of the way.",Andy
Which combo do you think Robert's gonna like better?,Andy
Just wear one of your bowties.,Phyllis
"No! I mean, let him, he should just explore other options...",Kelly
"Bowties, no offense, are a black thing. They're for rappers and NBA players. I cringe when I see Tucker Carlson trying to pull off a bowtie. It's like yeah Tucker, you're so street.",Kelly
This is combo number seven.,Andy
"Hmm, no.",All
I don't like that clip.,Pam
"You're right, you're right, you're right. Uh! It's so hard to find an occasion for this clip.",Andy
"I'd hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70's theme party, or a 70's theme meeting, or a 70's theme convention...",Jim
Sure.,Andy
1870's...,Jim
Thanks T-Dog.,Andy
T-Dog?,Ryan
I thought I was T-Dog.,Toby
"Nope, he means tuna dog.",Jim
Tuna dog!,Andy
"I thought the plane was flying pretty well on auto-pilot. And then Robert California ran into the cockpit with a gun and he was like ???Fly this plane to Cuba, and on the way bomb Texas??? Well I don't know how to get there. Or even how to fly, even. And I don't have any bombs.",Andy
Hey. Maybe it'd help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.,Erin
[sighs] Yeah.,Andy
What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.,Erin
I don't have any ideas though.,Andy
Well I have an idea.,Erin
You do?,Andy
What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You'd get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart's.,Erin
Yeah....I don't think that's legal. It's a nice thought though. [Erin hands Andy a gift] What is this?,Andy
"I just wanted to say congratulations on your new job, officially.",Erin
You didn't have to do that. [opens box to reveal red mouse cat toy attached to key chain],Andy
"I saw it at the checkout counter, it made me think of you. I don't know why. I made it into a key chain.",Erin
You're the only person who's congratulated me.,Andy
....back orders and you never called them.,Dwight
Can you believe this?,Oscar
There's a dog in the car.,Erin
"You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to ???I'd rather be snowboarding??? bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures.",Oscar
Do Snowboarders hate animals?,Jim
I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.,Oscar
"Oscar, it's not that hot out.",Andy
A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.,Darryl
"Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sunlight.",Andy
"So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?",Kelly
"Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.",Kevin
"OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. [Whistling and pouring water from bottle into sunroof of car] Come on.",Dwight
Dwight! At least aim it.,Jim
"There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.",Dwight
We're losing cloud cover.,Andy
"Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.",Kelly
"Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time.",Darryl
This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron],Oscar
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!,Jim
"Come on buddy, get back.",Oscar
"Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey! [Oscar busts out back window, group cries out in protest, then cheers]",Dwight
"Alright! Nice job, Oscar!",Jim
"And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds]",Oscar
"So...ah, who's gonna take the dog?",Jim
Why would we take the dog?,Oscar
What if he jumps out the window and runs away?,Jim
"Jim, he's not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]",Oscar
Whoa!,Meredith
"Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay.",Oscar
Nein. Sits. [snaps as dog calms] Goot.,Dwight
"Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?",Jim
[Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it.,Oscar
"Yeah, that's pretty good.",Jim
"Yeah, that'll work.",Dwight
That'll work.,Kelly
Nice job.,Jim
Bye poochie!,Dwight
Bye. [Andy barks],Kelly
"Bye! [Kevin's horn honks twice shortly, then one long honk. Shot shows him passed out on his steering wheel.]",Meredith
"What's that come to? Like, what did they each win?",Pam
"Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.",Jim
Awesome.,Pam
Before taxes.,Dwight
That's still a lot of money!,Phyllis
"The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!...and no one else can focus. [shot shows warehouse crew going wild in the office] This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I'm the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I'm the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I'm the one who has to say those things.",Andy
"[On phone] Hello?....Justine! [laughs] Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- [hangs up] Whoops.",Darryl
"When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ??? playing my birthday.",Darryl
What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?,Oscar
Yeah.,Phyllis
We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird sex thing.,Meredith
At least.,Oscar
"I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.",Jim
"I know what you'd do with all that money. [imitating Jim] ???Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug.???",Dwight
"No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.",Jim
"And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?",Pam
Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?,Jim
I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...,Pam
SoHo's mostly lofts but OK.,Ryan
"And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting...",Pam
"Oh, god.",Kelly
And then my handsome husband...,Pam
Which ideally would be me....,Jim
Would bring me a flavored coffee.,Pam
Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy?,Jim
Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters.,Pam
"I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...",Jim
[under her breath] get a divorce...get a divorce...,Meredith
"I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.",Kelly
"Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone. [lowers voice] To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. [normal voice] Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys?",Andy
I don't know.,Darryl
"What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?",Andy
No.,Darryl
Are they on their way over?,Andy
I haven't hired anyone.,Darryl
What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.,Phyllis
I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.,Darryl
This is kinda time sensitive.,Andy
I got it. I'm doin' it.,Darryl
"Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.",Phyllis
"Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in? [Erin raises hand]",Andy
As long as you guys don't need me up here.,Erin
No..we don't,Phyllis
I think we'll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement],Dwight
"Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?",Oscar
Are you volunteering?,Andy
Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes],Oscar
Jim! How 'bout you?,Andy
"Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...",Jim
"Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. [grunts] False. Andy, I will volunteer.",Dwight
Great. And Kevin.,Andy
Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.,Kevin
"Oh, thank you.",Pam
Sure.,Angela
"Wait, wait. What's this? [holds up clipboard]",Pam
"Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.",Angela
"It says ???Lotto Pool???, right on top. [points to obvious title]",Pam
Yeah. And I said sorry.,Angela
Oh come on. You really think I'm gonna have a fourteen pound baby?,Pam
When did I get so fat?,Darryl
You look awesome.,Andy
I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.,Darryl
Where are we in the process?,Andy
"I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process.",Darryl
Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?,Andy
The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.,Darryl
You do have a fantastic basement.,Andy
I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.,Darryl
"Right. Um, well how 'bout we take a look at some applications? ...This guy wrote his in green ink, that's pretty cool. Check it out. [attempts to give Darryl application who ignores him at first but then takes it]Hey! There ya go...there he is.",Andy
That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.,Andy
"OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.",Jim
"Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift]",Dwight
Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!,Jim
Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.],Kevin
Yup.,Dwight
"Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl.[no one laughs] What? No Newhart fans? OK...Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?",Andy
You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?,Darryl
Your old crew won the lottery?,Female Applicant
"Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system?",Andy
"Wait, wait. So all the old guys quit?",Male Applicant 1
Oh yeah.,Darryl
Well-,Andy
"One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. [Andy laughs awkwardly]",Darryl
"Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you're all doing great. [group begins leaving] maybe grab a coffee..or if there's any donuts out you can split one. You know they're for everybody so people get fussy....You know what? Just have a donut. [shuts door and sits, gesturing for Darryl to sit next to him. Then gets up to stand near Darryl.] Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?",Andy
I don't,Darryl
"You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so...",Andy
Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.,Darryl
"Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about.",Andy
OK.,Darryl
"We need you, OK?",Andy
OK.,Darryl
OK?,Andy
Yeah.,Darryl
Alright.,Andy
[Grunts while lifting box into truck] What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses],Dwight
I didn't feel anything.,Erin
"Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor.",Andy
Why do you wanna work here?,Darryl
I need a job.,Male Applicant 1
That's not a good reason.,Darryl
Good. Keepin' 'em honest.,Andy
"Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you???re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change.",Darryl
Are we scaring them straight....?,Andy
I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.,Darryl
"I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?",Darryl
Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me?,Ryan
No.,Pam
Why not? What are you doing?,Ryan
"Uh, buying lottery tickets online. [Ryan laughs]",Pam
"Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.",Ryan
"You came in at 10:30 today, right?",Pam
"OK, (we'll just dismiss it.)??????",Ryan
Is everyone licensed?,Andy
Like a driver's license?,Male Applicant 2
"No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.",Andy
Is this a joke?,Female Applicant
"No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now.",Andy
"[On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back.",Kevin
There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.,Jim
"Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.",Dwight
Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.,Jim
"[Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.",Dwight
I'd go with that.,Jim
Like baboons or elephants.,Dwight
"Not that, don't...",Jim
"Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.",Kevin
"It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-",Jim
Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.,Kevin
Kevin! Doesn't apply.,Dwight
Right. My mom-,Kevin
"[grabbing Kevin's arm] You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it! [Kevin tears up]",Erin
Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap? [raises hand and laughs] You'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um...,Andy
How much longer is this gonna take?,Male Applicant 1
Did you hire 'em?,Darryl
No. Because they all left.,Andy
What do you mean ???they left????,Darryl
"I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn???t help.",Andy
Then I think you should fire me.,Darryl
What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you.,Andy
Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.,Darryl
"???..OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke.",Andy
No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.,Darryl
"So Darryl says to me ???fire me???. But what he really means is ???I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means.??? So I say ???No, you're not fired.??? But what I really mean is ???I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.???........I really hope that's what he and I mean.",Andy
"Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.",Andy
Bulk or definition?,Oscar
Definition.,Andy
Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.,Oscar
Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?,Andy
"Oh, he's plenty strong.",Oscar
"It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.",Oscar
"So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings....",Pam
Our fake winnings,Jim
"And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France.",Pam
"It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.",Jim
"Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.",Pam
"Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]",Jim
"Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?",Dwight
A...hot chocolate tea,Jim
Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America's diminishing blue-collar workforce?,Andy
"North America...and, diminishing is a little reductive, but uh sure. That's the headline version.",Gideon
"Great....Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.",Andy
"FYI, Wednesday through Friday I have a pretty full teaching schedule.",Gideon
"Eh, cool. We'll figure that out.",Andy
"Also, FYI, ah, I don't techinically have a hearing problem, but sometimes when there's a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time, I'll hear 'em as one big jumble. Uh, again it's not that I can't hear, uh because that's false. I can. Um, I just can't distinguish between everything I'm hearing.",Nate
Got it. Dually noted. You! [points to Bruce] Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?,Andy
Made it.,Bruce
So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.,Andy
"Message in a Bottle, The Postman...",Dwight
Kevin Costner.,Jim
Kevin Costner.,Dwight
Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse],Jim
So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.,Kevin
You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!,Erin
"So, it's not the dumbest idea.",Jim
It's not the greatest one either...,Dwight
"But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.",Jim
And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in shot showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor],Dwight
"So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.",Jim
Exactly.,Dwight
I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim?,Kevin
Is he OK?,Jim
Yep. He'll be fine.,Dwight
Surprise! Your new crew.,Andy
"Would you just fire me, man?",Darryl
Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?,Andy
You wanna make me happy? Huh?,Darryl
Yeah.,Andy
Give me your job.,Darryl
"Haha, what?",Andy
"I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.",Darryl
"I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that.",Andy
"Also, Darryl, FYI, I already told this to Andy, but uh, you should probably know I technically don't have a hearing problem, it's just when there's a lot of noises...",Nate
"Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that?",Andy
He died.,Darryl
"He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it?",Andy
"What wa-, what was the last...I'm havin' a-",Nate
"None, no part of this has anything to do with you.",Andy
I didn't have time because of my daughter.,Darryl
"Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.",Andy
Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.,Darryl
Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. [long pause],Andy
OK.,Darryl
OK what?,Andy
"OK, don't fire me.",Darryl
"Ah, OK.",Andy
My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.,Darryl
"I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.",Darryl
"Yeah. [laughs] That makes sense. OK. Good, alright.",Andy
Here...,Kevin
What is goin' on?! [shot shows greased aisle flanked by rows of boxes],Andy
Oh hey guys.,Kevin
Why is the forklift in the wall?,Darryl
Why is the truck empty?,Andy
"Uh, it's not totally empty.",Dwight
Is that grease on my floor?,Darryl
"OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.",Dwight
And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?,Darryl
"OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.",Kevin
"OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.",Jim
And?,Darryl
And we did.,Erin
I don't know.,Dwight
Jim? Tell them what it's called.,Erin
That's alright.,Jim
"No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.",Kevin
"Doesn't matter what the name is. Se??or Loadenstein, that's stupid.",Jim
"[laughing] Se??or Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim.",Kevin
"That's OK, we're good.",Jim
Jim...,Erin
"No, Jim. Tell us why it's called Se??or Loadenstein.",Andy
Porque es muy rapido.,Jim
"OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.",Dwight
Let me see it.,Darryl
"It's uh, it's in beta testing.",Dwight
Let me see it!,Darryl
"Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.",Dwight
"Uno! Dos! Tres! [Shot shows Jim & Dwight pulling ropes attached to a plank holding Erin in a helmet and boxes of paper down the greased runway, Dwight grunts]","Dwight, Erin, Jim & Kevin"

We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.,Pam
Right. It's city and country combined.,Jim
Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.,Pam
And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.,Jim
Just like now.,Pam
[laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.,Jim
Oh..,Pam
But what are you gonna do about that?,Jim
What are you gonna do?,Pam
"If I won the lottery, I don't know. I don't think I'd make any changes to my life. Quit my job, move, meet someone....",Toby
"I'd give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they can't cure AIDS with 25%, the extra ten's not gonna make a difference. At some point, you're just throwing good money after bad.",Ryan

"Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we're basically there.",Jim
"I know. Kevin, we've been friends for a long time, right?",Dwight
Egons.,Kevin
So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-,Dwight
"Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.",Jim
"I wouldn't be asking you lightly, now would I?",Dwight
No.,Kevin
"Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er...",Dwight
Dammit Dwight!,Jim
However it's normally done.,Kevin
"Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?",Jim
"Yeah Jim, why's it so far?",Kevin
Why's it so far away?,Erin
"Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.",Jim
"Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?",Dwight
So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck],Jim
Back...,Kevin
Yeah.,Erin
That looks good. Back. Whoa whoa whoa!,Kevin
Whoa whoa whoa!,Jim
You're doing great! A little farther away from the wall!,Erin
No no no!,Kevin
Good...,Erin
"No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.",Jim
Come on!,Dwight
Good.,Jim
"[entering office] Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.",Jim
"Yeah? Pretty cool, huh?",Andy
What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?,Andy
How'd it look?,Andy
"You've seen it, right?",Jim
No.,Andy
"Andy, somebody defaced it.",Pam
"What? [Stanley enters office laughing] Morning, Stanley.",Andy
"There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.",Jim
"Erin, how long did we order those billboards for?",Andy
Six months.,Erin
"Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.",Andy
"[entering office] Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it.",Meredith
Which one did you see?,Andy
"Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.",Meredith
"Okay, don't be gross.",Jim
[entering office] What's going on?,Dwight
Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.,Pam
"Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?",Dwight
"Yeah, Dwight.",Andy
"No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! [running from building] No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! [stopping in front of defaced billboard] NOOOOOOOOO!",Dwight

It's simpler this way.,Dwight
It's really not.,Oscar
"Now, stated arrival time is 3 p.m.",Andy
I don't get the reason for this party.,Kelly
"Yeah, what's the reason?",Phyllis
"What's the reason, Andy? What's the reason?",Kelly
It's just a garden party. Sheesh.,Andy
You don't need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It's a garden party. You don't need a reason.,Andy
"Few other super simple reminders ??? no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?",Andy
"What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?",Darryl
"I get it, I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all... step it up.",Andy
"Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children.",Oscar
"Yeah, it's just a picnic.",Phyllis
"This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it's a garden party.",Andy
There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring.,Darryl
"Aw, ew, please don't. Not a barbecue. It's better than a barbecue. It's dignified, quieter, there are rules.",Andy
How is that better than a barbecue?,Pam
What's the dress code on this?,Ryan
I'm glad you asked ??? Connecticut Casual.,Andy
"Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I'm wearing to your party.",Stanley
"Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother's promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there's a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet. [video playing on computer]",Andy
"Yeah, Oscar, you showed me this.",Kevin
"I've seen this, that's not you.",Darryl
"Yeah, whoa, who's the sausage?",Meredith
"It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time.",Andy
"Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?",Jim
"Yeah, of course. Ye... I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did. [groans from the group]",Andy
Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?,Phyllis
"I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic Gabe move. Hey Andy, how about you don't steal my business strategies, and I won't dress like my life is just one long brunch?",Gabe
"See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time.",Andy
"And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.",Dwight
"[pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw]",Jim
They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.,Dwight
"Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?",Jim
There's so much more to it than that.,Dwight
"I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. [holds up book, Throwing A Garden Party by James Trickington] Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars. [laughs]",Dwight
I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I've only sold one copy.,Jim
Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?,Angela
Nope.,Pam
I've already gone up another cup size. The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?,Angela
"Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier.",Pam
Phillip?,Angela
"Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather.",Pam
Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.,Angela
"[giggling] Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather.",Pam
It's after my cat.,Angela
"[on the phone] Andrew, I've picked up two possible gifts to bring this afternoon. One, a pot of marmalade.",Robert
"Ooh, that sounds great.",Andy
"Well, that, that is what you want then, the marmalade.",Robert
Sure.,Andy
You don't want to hear the other one. You love marmalade.,Robert
"Uh, I'll hear the other one.",Andy
It's a basil plant.,Robert
"You know, the marmalade sounds great.",Andy
I also mentioned the marmalade to my sister and she's very interested.,Robert
Then the basil will be fine.,Andy
"Well, you clearly want the marmalade. Gretchen, I need another marmalade. Alright. [hangs up]",Robert
"Hey, where do I park?",Toby
I'm the valet. You have to give me your car.,Mose
"Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself.",Toby
I'm the... I'm the valet. You have to give me your car.,Mose
It's probably okay...,Toby
Give me your car.,Mose
I think it's better that I...,Toby
Give me your car.,Mose
It's a finicky car...,Toby
Get out. Have a good time at the thing.,Mose
"It's a little tricky, you might have to... take... [Mose speeds away]",Toby
MR. RYAN HOWARD!,Dwight
"Chapter 2 ??? Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.",Jim
"STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!",Dwight
"How's it going over here, guys?",Andy
"Andy, stop hovering, you're being really annoying.",Oscar
"Didn't mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table.",Andy
Wow.,Oscar
MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!,Dwight
"So, you all work with Andy.",Walter
"Well, technically FOR Andy.",Andy
Technically FOR Robert California. He's our CEO.,Oscar
I thought you were the CEO.,Ellen
I don't know how you got there.,Andy
You said you were running the company.,Walter
"This branch, I'm the regional manager.",Andy
"Yes, that makes more sense. Are you all regional managers?",Walter
"Did I throw this party to impress my parents? That's crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves, which, as a matter of fact, they did, last week. They threw one for my baby brother who is totally amazing, but I couldn't care less.",Andy
Can I introduce you around now?,Andy
"Uh, yeah, we don't have too long, we have theater tickets.",Walter
What are you going to see?,Andy
Money Ball. Walter Jr.'s choice.,Walter
What??,Andy
Hey Bronard!,Walter Jr
I didn't know you were going to be here.,Andy
I wouldn't have missed it.,Walter Jr
Ahh! [bird steals her hat],Erin
"I'm Walter, Andy's younger brother.",Walter Jr
"Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim.",Jim
"Tuna, right? And this must be your lovely wife Pam [looking at Meredith].",Walter Jr
No.,Jim
Hell no. She wishes.,Meredith
"No, no, no, no, no. No.",Jim
"Sir, I need to be able to feed all the guests.",Waiter
[mouthful of food] I understand.,Kevin
Set that down. [grabs waitress] Present yourself.,Dwight
Chapter 4 ??? One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.,Jim
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!",Dwight
Hello Andy.,Robert
Welcome.,Andy
Thank you.,Robert
"Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad.",Andy
"Yes, hello, nice to meet you.",Robert
Pleasure.,Walter
"Andy, where shall I put your basil plant?",Robert
"Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade.",Andy
"No, I'm certain you said basil.",Robert
"This is not funny, man, let me down.",Ryan
I think this thing is broken.,Kevin
"It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.",Ryan
So pretty today.,Andy
It's getting chilly.,Ellen
We really should be leaving.,Walter
"Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.",Andy
"Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That's my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity.",Andy
"Let's hear from you guys, who do you want to toast?",Andy
"Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! [everyone toasts]",Darryl
"I can't believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress?",Gabe
"I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!",Angela
"I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!",Pam
She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!,Angela
I'd like to make a toast to the troops. All the troops. Both sides.,Ryan
I think we should toast...,Erin
Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.,Dwight
"Chapter 9 ??? The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.",Jim
Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.,Kevin
"I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California,...",Gabe
You can't triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once.,Andy
"I'll say a few words if that's alright with you, Andy.",Robert
"Yeah, yeah.",Andy
"You people say I led you, but it wasn't me. You want to toast the man who led you to success, but the boss is irrelevant. Andy and I, we produce nothing. We do nothing. We sit in our offices and demand, I want this and that right now, like petulant children. You know, the difference between a crying baby and a manager, one day the baby will grow up. But, without you, Andy and I would be sitting in our dirty diapers, waiting for someone to change us, wipe us. I should be toasting you, thanking you, for allowing me to have the easiest job in the universe. Cheers.",Robert
"To Robert California, from the moment you entered our building and our hearts, you...",Gabe
"Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage!",Andy
"I'm eating, Andy.",Walter
"Ah, come on!",Andy
Okay. Okay.,Walter
Yes!,Andy
What do you want to do?,Walter
"Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets? [starts playing guitar]",Andy
"Oh, whoa, sure? Really? It's a little tricky.",Walter
[singing] Saying I love you is not the words...,Andy
It's too high.,Walter
Yeah?,Andy
It's high but it's not that high.,Walter
"Right, it feels strange.",Andy
Just take it down a little.,Walter
Saying I love... Saying I love you...,Andy
"Here, give it to me. Okay. Uh, something like... [singing] Saying I love you is...",Walter
...not the words...,Andy & Walter
"You don't come in yet. [singing] ...I want to hear from you, It's not that I want you...",Walter
...not to say it but if you only knew... More than words is all you have to do to make it real...,Andy & Walter
Is anyone filming this? Seriously! Erin!,Andy
[holding up cell phone] It's either taping or calling.,Erin
What would you do if my heart was torn in two...,Andy & Walter
"You know what, Walter Jr. is here. Why don't you come up and join us?",Walter
"Dad, no. I'm just having a good time getting to know Andy's friends here.",Walter Jr
Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you'll never be able to sing again. Woo!,Meredith
"[singing] May the good lord be with you down every road you roam. And may sunshine and happiness surround you when you're far from home. And may you grow to be proud, dignified and true. And do unto others as you'd have done to you...",Walter & Walter Jr
"[applauds] Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar.",Andy
"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.",Erin's Cell Phone
Sorry.,Erin
I am so cold.,Kelly
That's because you didn't bring a jacket.,Ryan
"My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?",Dwight
Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here.,Robert
"Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?",Dwight
Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me?,Robert
"I can get you exotic meats ??? hippo steaks, giraffe burgers...",Dwight
We'll talk. [walks away],Robert
It'll all be goat.,Dwight
"Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I'd very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn't even my worst sales call.",Andy
[knocks] Hi. What was that display?,Walter
"I don't know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you'd be proud of me.",Andy
Andrew...,Walter
"I know, I know that you're proud of me.",Andy
"I'm not going to tell you how impressed I am that you're a manager of some rinky dink branch of a paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. How long are you going to go on needing my approval? You're a grown man, don't act like a little boy who needs...",Walter
"I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.",Darryl
Guess we found Andy's rosebud.,Oscar
Rosebud?,Darryl
It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.,Oscar
"I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.",Darryl
Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.,Oscar
No. You're wrong.,Darryl
Are you sure?,Robert
Yeah! I'm too hot anyway.,Ryan
"My body has somehow become acclimated to southern Italy. Isn't that strange? I've never been there! Oh, ah, yes, that's nice. Thank you.",Robert
"It was a nice party, the setting was a little strange. Uh, the food...",Walter
Sandwiches were dry.,Ellen
"Bye Tuna, bye Pam!",Walter Jr
"Hey everybody, I'm gonna leave and I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.",Andy
Cheeseburger or hamburger.,Darryl
"Um, cheeseburger.",Andy
Narddog. [throws Andy a can],Oscar
"Thanks, Oscar.",Andy
What are they doing?,Pam
Closing ceremonies.,Jim
Nice touch.,Pam
I think I left my wallet in your house.,Jim
Who cares.,Dwight
Right here.,Jim
MR. JAMES HALPERT!,Dwight
"Keys, keys...",Jim
Stop forgetting things.,Dwight
"I didn't forget them, they're right here.",Jim
MR. JAMES HALPERT!,Dwight
"I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...",Jim
What? Idiot.,Dwight
Whoo.,Jim
MIS... MI... What are you doing?,Dwight
"Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?",Jim
"That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!",Dwight
I cannot believe how condescending Andy's being.,Oscar
He gets condescending when he's nervous. Or when he's excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.,Darryl
Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class. I'm a lady. I'm a mother. I'm a former boxer!,Meredith
"Hey guys, getting psyched for the party? Ryan? Can I count on you to wear an understated satirical outfit?",Andy
Can't wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment's at 9%. I wouldn't miss it for the world.,Ryan
Awesome.,Andy
Erin....the receptionist!,Dwight
"Oh, oh, oh, Kevin. I am reminded of a lame but useful saying I learned as a kid. What is the difference between Hors d'oeuvres and the animals on Noah's ark?",Andy
What?,Kevin
With Hors d'oeuvres we only take one at a time.,Andy
"Oh, OK. What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?",Kevin
Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.,Jim
"When all this is over, I'd like to actually go to one of Trickington's parties, they sound like a blast.",Dwight
Ladies and Gentlemen! I present to you...the Alamo! [reveals lump of ice],Dwight
Little Cici asleep?,Angela
"Yeah, she just went down.",Pam
Such a precious little angel.,Angela
Aww.,Pam
Cecilia....and Phillip.,Angela
"Yes, after my grandfather.",Pam
Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn't even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It's just something you do to a hole!,Angela
"Well I'm having my baby first, so that's that.",Pam
"You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I'll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.",Angela
You think your doctor's going to give you a C-section at six months?,Pam
Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.,Angela
"My parents are used to a certain type of class. The people that I work with are a different type of class. One is not better than the other, it's just that maybe one's a little higher than the other?",Andy
[looking at Angela's costume] Approved!,Andy
"[claps] Chef from South Park, it's genius!",Andy
Just some chef.,Stanley
"I've decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules - don't be offensive, don't be cliche, and don't take the first two rules too seriously.",Andy
The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.,Kevin
"Whoa! Aw, spoiler alert.",Andy
"It's been out for ages, man.",Kevin
Costume vetoed.,Andy
"Ah, it's, uh... somebody's already called that.",Andy
Who?,Phyllis
Kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow.,Andy
This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's?,Kelly
"Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It's like, I can't choose. They're both amazing. It's just...",Andy
"Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here.",Kelly
Because I was there. [shows Kelly her cell phone video] Your the people's princess! Diana was nothing!,Meredith
I thought you were at your sister's funeral.,Andy
"What I said was, ???My sister's funeral is this weekend.??? Didn't say I'd be there.",Meredith
"Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it.",Meredith
"Um, can I, maybe, squeeze through?",Andy
Here you go.,Erin
There you go. Thank you.,Andy
"When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.",Erin
"Jim, put it on.",Kevin
"Put it on, man.",Darryl
I don't know if I can.,Jim
"Come on, the Three Amigos.",Kevin
Three Kings.,Darryl
Alright.,Jim
"I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.",Jim
"[to Kelly] If you get into season 1, you can really...",Ryan
"[Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?",Kelly
It's called a costume.,Dwight
"What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?",Kelly
"Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?",Dwight
Whoopi Goldberg.,Ryan
"Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault.",Dwight
"Every Halloween I tell him the same thing - You can't bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing - As soon as I get my weapons back I'm gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. I'm a lucky turkey.",Toby
"Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I'm not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just... wanna make sure this is the best we can do?",Andy
I just got a text from Broccoli Rob - 'Boo!' Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California - 'Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high.' Scared the s**t out of me.,Andy
"G'day, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me?",Andy
Yeah.,Pam
Australian accent...,Andy
"[faxing, Erin watching over her shoulder] What are you doing?",Pam
"Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't.",Erin
"Oh. [sends fax, Erin nods] Are you...",Pam
"That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?",Erin
"Oh, Erin...",Pam
"Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?",Erin
"Um, 2?",Pam
"That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.",Erin
"No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?",Pam
Yeah...,Erin
Yeah.,Pam
"Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny.",Erin
Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.,Phyllis
I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.,Oscar
"Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello.",Pam
"[sigh] What happened, Pam?",Oscar
"Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story...",Pam
"Wait, they have food there?",Phyllis
"...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black.",Pam
No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.,Jim
Hey.,Jim
Hey!,Pam
"Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?",Jim
What do you mean?,Pam
"Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?",Jim
I saw a ghost.,Pam
"Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?",Jim
"It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.",Pam
"Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.",Jim
"I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.",Pam
"Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack attack!",Andy
"Yes, Andrew. And you, on this day of fantasy, are a laborer.",Robert
Yes.,Andy
"Everyone, this Bert, my son. Bert, this is... a paper company.",Robert
Hello. Can I use a computer? I need to check a hurricane.,Bert
"Here, use this one. [walking to Jim's desk]",Robert
"Oh, look, Pin The Wart On The Wench. How did you know I was bringing my son?",Robert
"Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?",Erin
That stuff's for babies.,Bert
"Well, perhaps this party will awaken the baby in all of us.",Robert
"Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? We're still getting it set up, it's gonna be really cool.",Andy
[laughing] Extraordinary. Did you plan this?,Robert
"Well, Toby and I did, yeah.",Kelly
"And I overheard, and thought, hey, that'd be fun, don't mind if I do.",Gabe
If you turn out the lights we'll do a little dance.,Toby
"1, 2, 3!",Kelly
"[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.",Gabe/Kelly/Toby
[laughing and clapping] Delightful.,Robert
Thank you. [Gabe mumbles],Kelly
"Now then, how are we today?",Robert
Fine.,Kelly
Great.,Toby
"Just fine, Kelly? Everything alright?",Robert
Mmhmm.,Kelly
You feeling fulfilled in your life?,Robert
I guess.,Kelly
"You guess? So, there is something you want that you do not have.",Robert
I try not to think about it.,Kelly
"Because it's too terrifying to imagine. Now we're cooking. What is it, Kelly? What is this great fear of yours?",Robert
Never marrying.,Kelly
"Yes. Dying alone, that is very scary. And how are you, Toby?",Robert
So great.,Toby
"Oh, I put those up.",Erin
I know. I'm taking them down.,Angela
I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.,Phyllis
"I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so...",Erin
"Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?",Angela
Oh.,Erin
"So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.",Angela
"Very low pressure in the Sargasso Sea, warm air from South America, cold air from Greenland. All signs point to the perfect storm.",Bert
"Yeah, perfectly mediocre.",Dwight
"What are you, anyway?",Bert
"I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.",Dwight
"If you had some really big wings with blades on the end, you'd kind of look like Kerrigan from Starcraft.",Bert
Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.,Dwight
"If you're going to be a Zerg, at least be a Lurker, not some girl.",Bert
Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!,Dwight
"Yeah, she also has boobs.",Bert
"Yeah, but no nipples.",Dwight
Hey.,Erin
Hey. What's up?,Andy
"November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!",Erin
Yeah...,Andy
"Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?",Erin
"Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG.",Andy
"But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?",Erin
"Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call.",Andy
"Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can.",Erin
[pretending to be on the phone] Yes. [laughs] I don't know. Mmhmm.,Andy
Gabe?,Erin
Sweetheart.,Gabe
I???m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little. I think it could use some extra pizazz.,Erin
Ok where does Gabe factor in?,Gabe
Remember that Halloween party you took me to once? The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn???t stop crying?,Erin
Yes. Lars and Decocco???s,Gabe
"Ok. Let???s say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one. Just??? more adult??? more??? scary and sexy",Erin
I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine.,Gabe
No ??? just scary. If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.,Erin
"[laughs, eventually Erin joins him laughing] Oh that would be scary!",Gabe
What are you thinking?,Erin
Ok let me go get it.,Gabe
[answers phone] Pam Halpert.,Pam
Hey it???s Jim Halpert. I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight. Because I???ve read a lot about this really great documentary.,Jim
Is it called Ghostbusters?,Pam
[laughs] It???s called Ghostbusters.,Jim
It didn???t look like that.,Pam
It didn???t have a buster sign around him? Why don???t you draw him? Why don???t we see this whole thing.,Jim
Ok fine I???ll draw him. [hangs up phone and draws],Pam
I ain???t fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa!,Jim
Mmhmm. Dwight are you eating a stick?,Pam
It???s a root you idiot.,Dwight
Everyone hates you.,Bert
That???s really rude. I don???t tell you hurricanes suck even though it???s true.,Dwight
What do you like? Tornadoes?,Bert
Try influenza.,Dwight
Oh yeah? What???s the vaccine you can take to avoid a hurricane?,Bert
Open up a newspaper. Oh look a hurricane???s coming. I suppose you???re going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?,Dwight
Try a box jelly fish.,Bert
You know that???s???,Jim
What are we talking about?,Robert
I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.,Jim
[to Kevin] You seem unimpressed. Ghosts don???t scare you?,Robert
I???m only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers. Not things that don???t exist like ghosts or mummies.,Kevin
Mummies are real. There are mummies at museums.,Oscar
Yeah [nervously]???prank,Kevin
It???s true. They???ve been preserved for thousands of years. They???re all over.,Robert
[screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?,Kevin
Witch???s brew?,Erin
I grew this party up real fast. Get out of here little kid party. Nobody loves you. And clean up your room! Grownups are going to use it later! Oooh!,Erin
Party looks fun doesn???t it? Everybody seems to be in there having a great time. So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.,Jim
I???m using it. I???m about to play Starcraft with him [points to Dwight].,Bert
[to Dwight] Are you serious?,Jim
Yeah I???m serious.,Dwight
That???s funny. Ok.,Jim
Loser.,Dwight
Yeah.,Bert
Pam do you think anyone???s going to notice I???ve worn this costume before? When I wasn???t pregnant. You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.,Angela
Hey guys. I???m an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying ???Representative Weiner] weiner.,Oscar
Oh my god!,Ryan
This party???s tight. The fog is cool.,Darryl
Thanks. It???s on medium.,Erin
Perfect.,Darryl
It really looks great. You did a great job.,Andy
"Oh, so we don???t have to have that talk.",Erin
We should still have that talk. Maybe you can come by my office at like 4:45? [Erin nods] Cool.,Andy
"[in ghostly voice] Oookayyy everybody. Be prepared to be scared. Ok. [hits play on DVD player, ???Do yes disturb meditations of horror??? appears on screen, Gabe winks at Erin, on screen food deflates, a mouse crawls across a photograph of a woman, a person brushes very dirty teeth]",Erin
The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement. The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea.,Gabe
"[cuts back to a Happy Birthday cake gushing blood when cut into, a doll melts, a woman eats food and puckers her face] Is that my grandmother?",Oscar
What???s the story?,Andy
There is no story.,Oscar
Yeah it seems like there isn???t a narrative. [on screen a man gets into a car] Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting.,Gabe
What the hell is going on here?,Stanley
I think we???ve seen enough. You can turn it off now. [everyone murmurs agreement] Yeah turn it off now.,Andy
How did you get in my car?,Stanley
Where is this from? That is so upsetting!,Oscar
That was awful. Robert I apologize.,Andy
I???m sorry. I got confused. I heard you wanted to make the party more adult. But I think I know what to do now [grabs box]. This game is called ???pecker Poker???. [fighting tears] It???s the game of cards that gets you hard.,Erin
What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.,Andy
Why didn???t you simply ask Andy to clarify? Asking is a very easy thing to do. You???re obviously very close. [Andy and Erin look awkwardly at each other and Robert]. Oh I see. This no longer seems like my business [Robert sits].,Robert
All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so???,Erin
You were going to talk at the end of the??? I???m not here.,Robert
Did you think I was going to fire you? No I wasn???t. [to Robert] I???m sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.,Andy
I???m never uncomfortable.,Robert
Ok. Erin I think you know I???ve been dating someone.,Andy
Sure.,Erin
And it???s getting a little more serious. She???s never come by.,Andy
And she???s never called here. Unless it???s your mom.,Erin
No I didn???t want her to call because I thought it would be weird. But now it???s weird that she???s not calling.,Andy
Two dates? Three dates?,Erin
Thirty-one.,Andy
Wow. I???m so happy for you guys. Um let me know when you get to forty. I???ll see you guys.,Erin
I should go.,Robert
"I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person.",Darryl
[whispering] Thank you.,Jim
Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?,Pam
"Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.",Jim
Really.,Pam
No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...,Jim
Exactly.,Kevin
Thank you.,Jim
"Go, get up there right now.",Dwight
Got it.,Bert
Dwight?,Darryl
"You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.",Dwight
Unleash the hellstorm.,Bert
Dwight.,Darryl
[laughs] Nice.,Dwight
Dwight!,Darryl
Got 'em. Go!,Dwight
Is she Asian?,Phyllis
"I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.",Erin
Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?,Phyllis
"I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city.",Erin
Hmm.,Phyllis
"Looks terribly real, doesn't it, Creed?",Robert
No...,Creed
Are you scared of snakes?,Robert
"You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby.",Creed
"[in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.",Darryl
"[talking to Robert] Honestly, Jim gives me the creeps.",Meredith
[to camera] What am I up to?,Robert
"Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, 'Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.' Now, you say one of two things - one, 'You're just having a bad dream,' or two, 'Let's go see what it was.'",Jim
"I'm not gonna freak her out, Jim.",Pam
Ok.,Jim
"I'm not gonna lie to her, either.",Pam
"Oh, come on!",Jim
"When I was a boy, there was an empty house just up the hill from my family's. It was rumored a man committed suicide there after being possessed by the devil. One day, a young woman, Lydia, moved into the house with her infant child. That very night, Lydia was awakened by a loud, heinous hissing sound. [hisses] She walked to the nursery, and there, in baby's crib, was a snake wrapped around baby's neck, squeezing tighter and tighter.",Robert
Oh my goodness.,Creed
"The crib was full of dirt. Baby struggled to free itself from underneath, reaching and clawing, gasping for air. Embalmed bodies rose from their sarcophagi, lurching toward baby, for they were mummies.",Robert
Nooo!,Kevin
"Amongst them was a man, tall, slim.",Robert
Jim. [rolls eyes],Meredith
"Almost instinctively, she turned to her husband. 'Oh, wait,' she thought, 'I don't have a husband.' For Lydia and her husband had had an argument, one they couldn't get past. Each night, they slept one inch farther apart, until one night, Lydia left. It was about this time she lost herself in imaginary worlds. She had quit the book club, the choir, citing something about their high expectations. Her lips slowly grew together from disuse. Everytime she wanted to act and didn't, another part of her face hardened, until it was stone. And that fevered night, she rushed to the nursery, threw open the door, 'Baby, are you okay?' Baby sat up slowly, turned to mother and said, 'I'm fine, b!tch, I'm fine.'",Robert
[laughs],Bert
"Fear plays an interesting role in our lives. How dare we let it motivate us. How dare we let it into our decision making, into our livelihoods, into our relationships. It's funny, isn't it, we take a day a year to dress up in costume and celebrate fear.",Robert
Toby?,Bert
"Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry...",Toby
You're fired.,Bert
...bones. What?,Toby
You heard me. Pack your things.,Bert
What... you can't... Gabe? Are you...,Toby
I'm the CEO's son. Pack your things. You're done.,Bert
"Oh, no.",Angela
Pink is the red-,Jim
What are we talking about?,Robert
"I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.",Jim
Have you seen a ghost?,Robert
Seen and banged.,Meredith
Hmph.,Oscar
"Ok, I met him in a bar, right? There's something weird about him. He doesn't smell right, the clothes are all tattered and dirty and from another age. Anyways, we end up back and my place and we go at it all night-",Meredith
"Meredith, don't.",Oscar
"No, no. I'm very comfortable with all things sexual. Continue.",Robert
"I wake up the next morning, all my stuff's gone. Whole house turned over. No trace. You tell me what happened.",Meredith
Have you considered the possibility that you slept with a drifter?,Robert
He didn't smell like a drifter.,Meredith
What are you anyway?,Bert
"I'm a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul.",Dwight
I'm a zombie from Walking Dead. It's a show.,Bert
"Uh, I know what it is. Ok? I have like a thousand people over every week to watch it. Ok? We all kinda hate it though.",Dwight
Who's your favorite character?,Bert
The city of Atlanta.,Dwight
"If ghosts are real, how come everyone knows what they look like? It's not like a bunch of people got together and agreed on a lie.",Stanley
Thank you.,Pam
"Interesting. Every culture holds this true. Clearly, there's some sort of real phenomenon out there...",Oscar
"Oscar, how are you on that side?",Jim
This isn't about sides. This is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes.,Pam
"Pam, this is important. Was he me? Am I him?",Creed
"No, Creed.",Pam
But that would make more sense. [Pam sighs],Jim
[Flickering Lights] Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here. [Plays radio and the song is Closing Time by Semisonic],Andy
[Laughs and shrieks],Erin
Closing time.,Andy
"Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over. Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day. It's weird.",Andy
Closing time,Andy
[On phone] ...W R K.,Jim
One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.,Andy
"Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten. Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.",Jim
Come on pam!,Andy
"[Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.",Andy/Pam
Let's see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I've heard 'Closing Time' a hundred and five times. [nods and shakes head] Still don't know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.,Pam
"I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home. [Pulls towel through legs] I know who I want to take me home. [Spins Meredith in chair] Take me hooo???hooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don't want to sing??? no traditions!",Andy
[singing] Closing time every new beginning???,Stanley
"I've never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it's time to go home. Now???it's my favorite song.",Stanley
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.,Andy/Stanley
Goodnight.,Stanley
Whose your favorite iron chef?,Andy
[speaking at the same time as andy] This is atrocious.,Robert
You go first.,Andy
"The ticketing software paints a picture of a sloppy, careless, error prone office.",Robert
Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes???,Andy
"[runs in and interrupts] Sorry, go ahead.",Dwight
[to dwight] Did you need something from us?,Robert
Wha???Yes. Your attention. Uh because??? No that is all. [walks out],Dwight
"Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted 'We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.",Dwight
Last week an accounting mistake resulted in a client getting their order for free.,Robert
Umpf???that's not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.,Andy
Who are they?,Robert
"They're both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture???",Andy
Andrew sometimes I feel like you don't know me at all.,Robert
I would agree with that.,Andy
Simply???end the mistakes,Robert
"End the mistakes, easy-",Andy
"When I come back next week and this report shows me no mistakes, we can talk about names, all day. Our favorite names, silly made up names, normal names said in a silly voice. Wouldn't that be nice?",Robert
I would like that.,Andy
End the mistakes. That is all I ask. [gets up from chair] And you can't have a favorite Iron Chef. It depends entirely on the secret ingredient. Sometimes I feel you don't know food at all.,Robert
"I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So???my pitch is???me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.",Jim
Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine.,Darryl
Is that off again?,Jim
Oh yeah.,Darryl
Ok.,Jim
"Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today.",Val
Ahh???We don't really do those. We just sign the thing.,Darryl
Are you really this lazy?,Val
I'll be there.,Darryl
Hey.,Gabe
Hey.,Val
Monday's suck.,Gabe
Yeaha???yup. [awkward silence then points to door] Just trying to get in.,Val
"I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.",Dwight
What do you got?,Andy
"[opens folder] Allow me. You're going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ugh???should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.",Dwight
Sounds controversial.,Andy
Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?,Dwight
Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop.,Andy
"Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.",Dwight
Go do the voodoo that you do so well.,Andy
I will do my voodoo.,Dwight
Mmhmmm.,Andy
Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship.,Gabe
For you?,Toby
Yes. For Gabe.,Gabe
Who are you seeing? That's gr???,Toby
Whom I'm seeing is Val from down in the warehouse.,Gabe
Oh.,Toby
"I'm not technically seeing her, but uh I've seen her, with the eyes and uh there was attraction. In at least one direction. So..[holds up fist]",Gabe
You know I don't have to do the paperwork unless you're actually dating.,Toby
"Ok, but once this starts, it's going to be moving fast. It's going to be hot and heavy and I don't want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know?",Gabe
But I mean???uh have you talked to her? Is sh???,Toby
Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondays???,Gabe
"Do you know her last name, yet?",Toby
Toby I'm going to tell you her last name tomorrow because she's going to be screaming it tonight.,Gabe
She's going to be screaming her own last name?,Toby
Hey! Watch it.,Gabe
Good luck Gabe.,Toby
"Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really.",Andy
Thank you.,Kevin
"And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call???Dwight???",Andy
The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.,Dwight
"If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.",Andy
Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.,Dwight
What emails are you talking about?,Kelly
"Robert's favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.",Dwight
That's not that bad actually.,Kelly
P.S. We should should kill him.,Dwight
"Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?",Jim
"No, it's an accountability booster.",Dwight
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.,Jim
"Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.",Dwight
"Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.",Kelly
We can't do this Dwight.,Ryan
[Everyone angrily disagreeing]Smile???nod. Smile and nod.,Dwight
"They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like???not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor???",Dwight
"Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.",Andy
"But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.",Dwight
"Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha.",Andy
This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me.,Stanley
There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.,Oscar
"[alert goes off] Oh, there's one mistake.",Dwight
Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.,Erin
Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I???,Andy
"It's not a doomsday device, gosh. [Erin makes red strike on desk] We can do this you guys.",Dwight
First. Second.,Warehouse Crew
It's not a race.,Darryl
Thirrrr???.third.,Warehouse Crew
Who knows what the belt is for?,Darryl
"It's for protecting my ass. When you suckers lift more than you can handle. Sup, I'm Gabe. Corporate. Continue. Don't be nervous.",Gabe
"Apparently we have a visitor. Gabe, everyone.",Darryl
"Hi, gabe.",Warehouse Crew
All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays.,Darryl
"Look at this, this is enormous.",Gabe
I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown. Considering that's the only thing I know about her. I will be milking that hard. [Gestures milking a cow],Gabe
It's like a hula hoop. Right. Mele Kalikimaka is the wise way.,Gabe
You done?,Darryl
"The Michelin man called, he wants his cummerbund back.",Gabe
Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.,Phyllis
I'm on it.,Kevin
"Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.",Angela
Good thinking.,Kevin
"Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.",Kevin
"Oscar, use a calculator. [Oscar shakes head]",Angela
"When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds. [points to his head]",Oscar
"Alright everybody, you are doing great!",Andy
"Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger]",Dwight
"Dwight, question.",Jim
No questions.,Dwight
If this doomsday device goes off...,Jim
Accountability booster.,Dwight
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?,Jim
I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.,Dwight
Try mose1234.,Stanley
"Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like???z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that.",Ryan
Ok.,Jim
How about Scrantonstrangler666.,Dwight
Nope.,Jim
"No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha???You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.",Dwight
Wha???what's Dwight's mothers name.,Kelly
Hmm???Heda. [alert] No.,Jim
"Once you read the packet, sign the back.",Darryl
"Hey Darryl, I was thinking, uh, maybe while we read through this, uh, you could grab us all some coffee. My treat. It's a hundred dollar bill. Should cover it I think. Don't bring me any of that caramel soy latte crap, ok? I want a decaf frappuccino. Val???",Gabe
"Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back.",Darryl
"Yeah, sure.",Val
Uh.,Gabe
Mmhmm. [points at gabe] Caramel soy latte.,Darryl
Decaf frap-,Gabe
Got it.,Darryl
You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?,Angela
"Mhm. Six-forty, six-twenty.",Oscar
"Six-seventy, six-twenty.",Angela
Nuh uh.,Oscar
yes!,Angela
Five eighty-eight plus fifteen percent- Oh no.,Oscar
What does this mean? What does it mean!,Kevin
Andy. [alert sounds],Oscar
Ohhhh!,Angela
Gahhh. That's five strikes.,Andy
"[pulls out Brandy bottle] Well???I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today.",Stanley
Dwight we got five strikes.,Andy
Really?,Dwight
Did the email go out or???,Andy
It goes out automatically at five P.M.,Dwight
"Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it.",Andy
"Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.",Dwight
Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.,Andy
No.,Dwight
What?!,Andy
You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.,Dwight
We did our best.,Phyllis
"No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. [everyone interjects] What?!",Dwight
"You're a real crumb bum, you know that?",Erin
"Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?",Dwight
"Uh, the man tree puts its penis-",Kevin
"Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.",Dwight
Nn no.,Andy
What?,Dwight
No!,Andy
Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.,Oscar
Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down!,Kelly
Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.,Dwight
Dwight's car is gone.,Erin
I bet he went home.,Pam
Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.,Andy
"Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.",Andy
Yeah.,Kevin
Kevin has that lovability.,Andy
Guys come on. I'm right here.,Kevin
"Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something.",Andy
"Ok, where is he?",Jim
"Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.",Erin
I'll try both.,Jim
[digging] Oh. Come to reason with me?,Dwight
"Gotcha something. [gives Dwight cap, Dwight throws it aside] And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-",Andy
Get lost.,Dwight
"Well now hold on it, it-",Andy
What are you doing?,Pam
What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.,Dwight
Uhm.,Pam
Do you need a hand?,Erin
"Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in]",Pam
"If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.",Dwight
"I'll see you next week Will. [at the club, playing squash]",Robert
Robert.,Jim
Jim what are you???What a surprise.,Robert
"Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.",Jim
Yeah.,Robert
You up for a game?,Jim
A game or a match?,Robert
Exactly. Here we go. Let's do it.,Jim
"Are you okay, Kevin? [Kevin gives thumbs down]",Pam
[to Dwight] Where you going?,Andy
In. I'm hungry.,Dwight
"Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.",Pam
"Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.",Dwight
"Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.",Pam
"This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.",Dwight
That's too much Doodle and not enough Lab.,Val
"Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab?",Darryl
That's what I'm sayin'.,Val
[to Val] Hey. You're welcome.,Gabe
Thanks for the coffee.,Val
"So, tonight I was thinking, I'm gonna go to the cemetery. I'm gonna drink a little wine and I thought maybe you'd like to come with me.",Gabe
Are you asking me on a date?,Val
"Yes, I am.",Gabe
"Because I don't date coworkers. It's not personal, it's a matter of policy.",Val
I could quit. Problem solved.,Gabe
"Don't quit. [Darryl eavesdropping, nods]",Val
Good policy. Sensible. Smart.,Darryl
Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.,Jim
In the box.,Robert
In the box. [hits it straight into the floor],Jim
Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left.,Oscar
"Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'-",Angela
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.,Oscar
"I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy]",Stanley
It's not that funny.,Oscar
"[Kevin comes around corner with a pan, ready to strike Dwight, Pam shakes her head] Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.",Erin
"Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right?",Pam
"Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's 'Nobody's perfect.' Nice stroke, Pam.",Dwight
"No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha.",Pam
"I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny.",Dwight
"Dwight, there's just a small matter of a-",Andy
You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.,Pam
Any specific animal?,Dwight
I'm thinking cow-,Pam
Don't say cow- Ugh.,Dwight
What are you doing? It's 5 to 5.,Andy
"Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.",Pam
That's insane!,Andy
Just trust me.,Pam
"Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning.",Andy
I got this.,Pam
Enngh-,Andy
"Hahhh, thanks for everything.",Pam
"Sive drafely. [Pam points back at him, smiling]",Dwight
"Isn't it supposed to be, 'Drive safely'?",Kevin
[a text tone goes off] Is that my phone?,Jim
Sounded like mine.,Robert
"Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.",Jim
"Well, it's mine. You took it out of my bag.",Robert
"Oh, oh yeah.",Jim
Can I have it?,Robert
Yes. Right now? Yes.,Jim

"Nah, it's good.",Robert
You sure?,Jim
Yeah.,Robert
What kinda iPhone is that?,Jim
It's the standard one. The one everyone has.,Robert
Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?,Jim
It depends Jim. Do you find one-day only Jet Blue sales to Buffalo interesting?,Robert
"Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone]",Jim
My serve!,Robert
[her text tones rings] Dwight stopped the device!,Pam
Oh!,Andy
Yes!,Kevin
Haho!,Erin
[his phone vibrates] He stopped it!,Oscar
"Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs.",Ryan
"They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. [pulls cap he previously discarded, out of the dirt] God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?",Dwight
Take it easy. Nice and easy.,Robert
"[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]",Jim
Oo!,Robert
I'm alright.,Jim
You alright?,Robert
Yep.,Jim
Skinned knee.,Robert
Yep. Ah. Oh. [and skinned elbow],Jim
"Oo, a little ice on that maybe.",Robert
Yeah. That does not feel good.,Jim
Okay. My serve.,Robert
Let's not make any mistakes today. Or at least no more than four.,Andy
This doomsday device sounds like a scare tactic to me. Y2K all over again.,Stanley
"Oh, I was all about the Y2K bug. Paid some guy to update my PC, threw out my microwave, canceled my plane ticket, sold all my stocks, spent New Year's Eve with a gas mask on my face. I was even wearing a diaper! Someone said Y2K would get the toilets.",Stanley
This could be real. Dwight's pretty handy with computers. He fixed my laptop once.,Pam
"Ok, he didn't fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.",Jim
You couldn't fix it.,Pam
I wasn't here that day.,Jim
Yes you were.,Pam
"No- Ok. Well, we'll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?",Jim
"I don't think so, babe.",Pam
"Ok, this is crazy.",Jim
"I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80's movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don't do that, I think I'll be alright.",Jim
Eleven love. I win again.,Robert
[grunts] Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?,Jim
I don't think so.,Robert
No? Come on.,Jim
"Why? Not only are you terrible at squash, but you don't even seem to enjoy it. Jim, this is not enough of a challenge for me.",Robert
"Well, that is... because you didn't realize that... I was left-handed.",Jim
"What are you doing here, Gabe?",Darryl
"Well Darryl, considering that I basically own the place, I'm just chillin' at mi casa. This is me, in repose..I suppose.",Gabe
"You know, there's this expression: Bro's before Ho's. And what that's short for is brothers before whores. Uh, I don't buy that. I would throw any brother under the bus for any whore. Woman.",Gabe
"Robert, do you wanna smoke pipes during our meeting?",Andy
"Let's wait, until we have something to smoke about.",Robert
Yes. Of course. [whispers] Erin..[throws pipes at Erin],Andy
"Hey, Andy.",Dwight
Yeah?,Andy
"Maybe I could sit in on this one with you? You know, that way I can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate...",Dwight
I don't think so.,Andy
Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all...,Dwight
"Yeah. I'm still figuring out the two man bobsled here, so let's hold off on the D-man for now.",Andy
Erin.,Andy
Yeah.,Erin
In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I???m not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.,Andy
Who???s calling?,Erin
Nobody. Just say that I'm- Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I???m going to refuse to take it.,Andy
You???re not going to take it?,Erin
Just make up a phone call. It???s not a real call. Make it up.,Andy
Ohohohoh.,Erin
And come and tell me. Doesn???t matter what it is.,Andy
You???re not going to get it though?,Erin
I???m not going to take it. And then he???s going to be like ???whoa this is a really important meeting???.,Andy
Copy that.,Erin
Okay.,Andy
"Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I???ll tell you how we can beat it.",Andy
Uh well we???ve been going with???,Client
Andy.,Erin
Yeah.,Andy
You have a very important call.,Erin
I???m sorry ??? I???m with a very important client. It???ll have to wait.,Andy
"Are you sure? It???s really, really important.",Erin
There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.,Andy
Really? Because your mother is dead.,Erin
Oh my God.,Client
I don???t think she???s dead.,Andy
She???s dead. She was hit by a bus.,Erin
She???s not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.,Andy
This isn???t one of those times. It???s the police. They said it???s the worst they???ve ever seen.,Erin
Andy I???m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.,Dwight
Oh you must take this call. It's???,Client
Yeah. Um line 1?,Andy
Line 2.,Erin
Hi.,Andy
[on phone]It???s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.,Darryl
"Ooh, gosh!",Andy
Dude.,Darryl
Officer.,Andy
Look man this is a bad idea.,Darryl
Did she have any last words or?,Andy
Really? That is messed up man.,Darryl
Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.,Andy
You???re a bad man Andy Bernard.,Darryl
That is so mom.,Andy
That stuff can come back to get you. It???s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle???,Darryl
Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?,Andy
Hey Cathy.,Pam
Hi.,Cathy
How???s it going? Everything make sense?,Pam
I think everything is under control.,Cathy
Great.,Pam
You should sit down.,Cathy
"Oh no, I???m fine.",Pam
No I should go fill out my paperwork.,Cathy
Ok [squeaking sound] Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.,Pam
Oh we know.,Dwight
I???m training a temp to be my replacement while I???m on maternity leave. Oh I should???ve mentioned I???m pregnant. You probably didn???t notice because it???s impossible to tell I???m so small. But yeah I???m pregnant. [another squeak] Oh come on!,Pam
Hey ??? asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?,Ryan
Hmm. Doubt it.,Jim
Yeah me too.,Ryan
You doubt it?,Pam
What???s that?,Jim
Why do you doubt that she???s single?,Pam
Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we???d save her from Ryan right?,Jim
What are you doing with my lunch?,Darryl
I???m delivering it from the fridge. It???s like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?,Andy
It???s not pizza.,Darryl
Yeah and we???re not about to make love. I just thought maybe you???d want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.,Andy
I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?,Darryl
Uh you tell me [Kevin playing drums with chicken legs],Andy
So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.,Ryan
Well he???s probably a drug dealer. That???s the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow.,Gabe
"It???s going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.",Toby
Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.,Oscar
Good energy,Offscreen
It???s going to be good to have someone hot at Pam???s desk huh?,Pam
"No, no. Not even.",Oscar
I???m kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She???s obviously super cute I get it. But I???d like to point out there???s 50 pounds more of me to love if that???s your thing.,Pam
Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.,Oscar
Radiant.,Toby
Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.,Pam
Yeah you have this sexy glow.,Phyllis
It???s one of the most common fetishes.,Gabe
Really well thank you all.,Pam
You know it???s not just pregnant women who don???t get their due. You know who???s gorgeous? Helen Mirren.,Toby
Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?,Ryan
You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It???s a pregnant Helen Mirren.,Toby
Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you???re saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.,Dwight
In this case yes.,Oscar
No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.,Dwight
No we???re not.,Phyllis
Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That???s right. You???re fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.,Dwight
"[scatting] Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray.",Andy
"Nice scatting, man.",Darryl
Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.,Andy
"Not bad fellas, you're better than you look.",Val
"Hey, screw you!",Kevin
"[sees Robert California enter] Hey Robert, are we meeting early?",Andy
Just taking a stroll. What exactly have I stumbled upon here?,Robert
Well we're all musicians and we play together sometimes.,Andy
You're a band.,Robert
Thank you.,Andy
We're called Kevin and the Zits.,Kevin
That was never agreed upon.,Darryl
I miss being in a band.,Robert
Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!,Andy
I have a tambourine.,Kevin
"Tambourine? You know I???m the CEO, right?",Robert
[to Kevin] CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.,Andy
I play harmonica. I think I have one in the car.,Robert
Great!,Andy
"Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!",Kevin
"Again, never agreed upon.",Darryl
"I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you're in a rock and roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life!",Andy
"Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right?",Darryl
"Yeah, even cooler.",Andy
We all got to go sometime.,Kevin
Hey.,Pam
Hey.,Jim
Helen Mirren. Hot?,Pam
Yeah. Super pretty.,Jim
Huh. What about Cathy?,Pam
The temp?,Jim
Yeah. Do you think she's hot?,Pam
Nope.,Jim
"I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?",Pam
"And I'm telling you, I don't.",Jim
You don't find Cathy attractive?,Pam
"No, I don't.",Jim
"No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I???m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.",Jim
Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.,Pam
"Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]",Jim
That's just absurd.,Dwight
"Yes, because she's hot, right?",Pam
"Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.",Dwight
"The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth.",Pam
"Dwight, am I hot right now?",Pam
"Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.",Dwight
What about before? Was I attractive before?,Pam
"Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.",Dwight
Hmm. I think Jim???s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.,Pam
You think Jim???s lying? [laughs] That's so cute. I know he's lying.,Dwight
Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.,Pam
Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman.,Dwight
"Yep, that's the Dwight I need.",Pam
"If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.",Dwight
Okay.,Pam
Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.,Dwight
I think so. Okay.,Pam
Rule two: we stop at nothing.,Dwight
"Well, what does that... is that... okay.",Pam
Rule three: Don't fall in love.,Dwight
"Yep, good.",Pam
We're gonna bust this guy.,Dwight
Honesty is very important to me.,Pam
So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.,Dwight
Let's just see how we feel when we get there.,Pam
"Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.",Kelly
None taken. What do you got?,Dwight
"It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot.",Kelly
Hmm.,Pam
"[to the keyboardist, Curtis, and the drummer] Hey, you found us!",Robert
"You guys sound great, man.",Curtis
"Darryl, Andy, Kevin, this is Curtis Dorough, local musician and the officiate at my wedding.",Robert
Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.,Darryl
"[to drummer] Dude, you're on TV! You???re the sportscaster on channel seven.",Kevin
Go Eagles! [laughs],Drummer
You do that on TV!,Kevin
You guys mind if they join us?,Robert
"Yeah, absolutely!",Andy
"Guys, I've got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and g??iro]",Kevin
"Hey, why don't you and me play those?",Darryl
"Yeah? Okay, this is awesome.",Kevin
What should we play?,Robert
Maybe we should warm up with some scales?,Kevin
Midnight Rambler?,Robert
Yeah.,Curtis
Midnight what?,Andy
"[singing] Have you heard about the midnight rambler? [Lisa, the guitarist, enters] Hey, come on in, baby. Yeah!",Curtis
"Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.",Pam
"Oh, I stand corrected.",Jim
I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?,Pam
"Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.",Jim
"Mike Tibbets, really?",Pam
Mm-hmm.,Jim
"Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?",Ryan
Not his mom's car.,Jim
"Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z.",Ryan
Touche?,Jim
[sees photo of Mike Tibbets] Eww!,Kelly
"Kelly, calm down.",Pam
"I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs.",Kelly
I don't think Jim cares about his hair.,Pam
"Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person.",Kelly
I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.,Dwight
Jim's on to me.,Pam
Hmm?,Dwight
"Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.",Pam
Just ugly enough to have deniability.,Dwight
Yep.,Pam
"Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.",Jim
"Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body.",Dwight
I'm gonna write something mean on his wall.,Kelly
"No, Kelly, don't.",Pam
"The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.",Dwight
With the crotch?,Pam and Kelly
With the crotch.,Dwight
[music plays] Whoo!,Kevin
Psst. We're not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed],Dwight
Who said that?,Creed
Exactly.,Dwight
How'd I get this long triangle?,Creed
"Okay, just shut it.",Dwight
Is he puffing out his chest?,Pam
I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?,Dwight
No. Maybe he just said something funny.,Pam
"Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.",Dwight
I think he's just making her laugh.,Pam
Time for me to find out.,Dwight
Why's he making her laugh so much?,Pam
"Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch]",Dwight
Dwight!,Jim
Are you okay?,Cathy
"I'm fine, I'm totally fine.",Dwight
Dwight! Dwight!,Jim
Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim.,Dwight
[to Cathy] Sorry about that.,Jim
"Aw, cramp, I'm just- [grabs Jim's crotch again]",Dwight
Dwight! [pushes Dwight's hands away] Why?,Jim
"I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.",Dwight
Leave.,Jim
"[to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.",Dwight
Why was he making her laugh so much?,Pam
"Oh, hey, I'll just be a second.",Pam
"Yeah, take your time.",Cathy
Okay.,Pam
"[to Jim] Oh, that line from Zoolander?",Cathy
Mm-hmm?,Jim
It was from a deleted scene so we were both right.,Cathy
[laughs] Told you.,Jim
"Um, do I hand in my expense reports to a particular accountant or-",Cathy
"Oscar, Cathy has a question!",Pam
"Sorry, um, I'll just go ask Oscar.",Cathy
[to Jim] Yeah?,Pam
You okay?,Jim
Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.,Pam
"Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?",Jim
"Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now.",Pam
"She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.",Dwight
"Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do.",Pam
And she called it nuts?,Dwight
"Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.",Darryl
Mm-hmm.,Kevin
Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?,Andy
Are you serious? From Star Trek?,Kevin
"[to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?",Darryl
I caught it.,Val
"What, you don't like the blues?",Darryl
I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues.,Val
"Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts]",Andy
I think the music left without you.,Val
Come on.,Dwight
Stop shoving me.,Jim
"[mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.",Dwight
[to Pam] Really?,Jim
This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.,Pam
"Uh, are you all in line?",Old Man
"Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?",Dwight
Si.,Jim
"Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him?",Pam
We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.,Dwight
You have to share the machine with others.,Old Man
"[mimicking] Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.",Dwight
"Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.",Jim
Thank you.,Old Man
"Jim, are you serious?",Dwight
"Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.",Jim
Maybe we could switch instruments.,Andy
Yeah.,Kevin
"Cause, uh, my body's starting to get bruised.",Andy
"Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?",Darryl
We had to leave because of creative differences.,Andy
Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing.,Darryl
"Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now.",Kevin
"No man, we are.",Darryl
Well-,Andy
"No, no, no.",Darryl
"[to old man] Okay, you're done.",Dwight
"I have a new heart, you know.",Old Man
"Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?",Dwight
"No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.",Jim
Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?,Dwight
No.,Jim
"Yep, he's lying.",Dwight
"Ah, see, was that so hard?",Pam
I am not lying.,Jim
Really?,Pam
"Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?",Jim
"I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?",Dwight
"Wait, what?",Pam
"Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.",Dwight
"Jim, you have high blood pressure.",Pam
"Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.",Dwight
Doesn't your dad have high blood pressure?,Pam
"Yeah, but I don't smoke.",Jim
When was the last time you went to the doctor?,Pam
I don't know.,Jim
It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-,Dwight
"Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?",Pam
"Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.",Jim
"It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.",Dwight
Okay.,Jim
"Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor.",Pam
Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?,Dwight
Just go home. It doesn't matter.,Pam
"But... hey, Cece's toothbrush.",Dwight
Thank you.,Jim
Oh baby I love your way.,Andy and Darryl
Every day.,Darryl
Wanna be with you night and day.,Andy and Darryl
And day.,Darryl and Kevin
Oh baby I love your way.,Andy and Darryl

I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle.,Andy
Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?,Andy
It's right here in PA.,Erin
"[gags, coughs] Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-",Andy
"Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg.",Angela
That sounds super inspiring! I'm in!,Andy
Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.,Dwight
Actually it is the northernmost.,Oscar
Ha!,Dwight
The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. [scoffs] Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.,Dwight
Charge!,Andy
"Well, this could be fun. I-",Phyllis
"Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?",Andy
What's the halal option?,Ryan
"Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese.",Andy
Out.,Ryan
"You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me?",Andy
I'm in.,Erin
I'm in too.,Phyllis

Cool. Thanks.,Erin

"Well, I was hoping to talk out some ideas with Andy. But what we have here... is perhaps better. By not going on the trip, you've shown you're the free-thinkers of the office.",Robert
"Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon.",Ryan
"So, here what we can do. Game changers- changes to the game such that the game can never be played the same way again. Everyone, brainstorm some innovations. Don't be afraid to get weird with it. Meredith! [wakes her up] Excited!",Robert
[tries stapler/marker combo] Okay.,Kevin
You guys...,Andy
J-j-j-ju...,Darryl
Get excited!,Andy
Shh! Movie's almost over.,Darryl
All right! We're here. Limitless can wait.,Andy
"Fun fact. In France, they call Limitless 'The Man with Many Capabilities.'",Gabe
Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.,Andy
I got Source Code on the way back.,Darryl
Ooh! All right!,Everyone
Woo!,Andy
"Whoa, where you going?",Andy
"Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?",Jim
"Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists.",Andy
"No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.",Jim
"Yeah, sign says 'Begin tour here.'",Phyllis
Unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour.,Andy
"After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch.",Andy
"[to Dwight] Yeah, but I'm confused...",Erin
"Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre...",Dwight
Mm-hmm.,Erin
...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.,Dwight
Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.,Erin
"Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.",Dwight
"Dwight, what are you telling this girl?",Oscar
The truth.,Dwight
"Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.",Oscar
"Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said.",Erin
"No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.",Dwight
Interesting.,Erin
"Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.",Dwight
"Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?",Oscar
"Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-",Dwight
he's a historian.,Oscar
"Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?",Dwight
"Yes, yes, yes!",Oscar
Not by a long shot!,Dwight
No!,Erin
Yes!,Oscar
"No, it was not!",Dwight
Argh!,Oscar
"No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?",Dwight
What?,Oscar
Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!,Dwight
Erin-,Oscar
"Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.",Dwight
Get out of here!,Erin
"I am so eager to hear your game-changers. Let's dig in, shall we?",Robert
May I go first?,Ryan
Absolutely.,Robert
"Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.",Ryan
This idea hasn't gripped me. What else did you come up with?,Robert
"Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-",Ryan
That was bad.,Robert
"If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.",Stanley
"The situation you described, returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine, is not one I'm familiar with.",Robert
In the African-American community-,Stanley
No.,Robert
[murmurs] Thought it was worth a try.,Stanley
"That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?",Darryl
"Oh, well, that's a great question. Actually some of the most-",Park Ranger
"Excuse me, I got a question for you.",Dwight
Sure.,Park Ranger
Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?,Dwight
"Uh, I haven't heard of that one.",Park Ranger
"Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?",Dwight
I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.,Oscar
We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho!,Andy
[taps Gabe's shoulder] Are you Lincoln?,Chelsea
"No, no, I'm-",Gabe
"Apparently, I bear a passing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums, historical monuments, elementary schools... I don't see it.
Chelsea's Mom: Chelsea, give Mr. Lincoln your hat so I can take a picture.",Gabe
"Okay, Quick.",Gabe
Hey! Lincoln's starting. [light applause],Man
"Oh, uh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm, uh, I'm actually with a tour group myself, so- [laughter] Hello! I'm Abraham Lincoln! Some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny. [laughter]",Gabe
"Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.",Pam
I am not.,Robert
"Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.",Pam
"At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.",Pam
"Kevin, you've been quiet. I'm curious to know what your game-changer is.",Robert
"Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So...",Kevin
Cookies. Cookie placement.,Robert
"Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.'",Kevin
"Who else agrees with Kevin, that we're wasting facilities, manpower, on our underselling products when we should be pushing our top-performers? [everyone raises their hand, Robert laughs] There you go. Consensus.",Robert
"Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.",Ryan
"[as Lincoln] I just don't understand. It's 1865, victory is ours, I've saved the very soul of our nation, and yet... happiness eludes me. Oh, perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits.",Gabe
No!,Audience
"Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... [scoffs] like, forget it.",Kevin
Interesting. So what is Dunder Mifflin's oatmeal cookie? What is the product that no one wants?,Robert
how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.,Stanley
"That's the oatmeal cookie. Fantastic, Kevin. Fantastic. [laughs]",Robert
Thank you.,Kevin
"By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?",Jim
Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought.,Andy
"Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.",Jim
Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.,Andy
Hunger for hamburger.,Darryl
"Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl?",Erin
That's good.,Darryl
"Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? [holds up flag] I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.",Andy
Only two hundred dollars?,Jim
"We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left.",Andy
"Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.",Darryl
"Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!",Andy
Spangler Springs is a mile this way.,Andy
Oh wow. So that???s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.,Jim
Its??? I mean come on.,Andy
"I don???t think I should walk anymore. You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast. Two poached eggs. And then half a sandwich on the bus.",Phyllis
Alright fine. You know what ??? I guess this place just hasn???t rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would. I???m still going. And I???m not going to ask anymore. I???m not even going to look back. I???m just going to assume that you???re with me.,Andy
[Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren???t going to look back.,Dwight
And why is Black Rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared?,Robert
I don???t know.,Kevin
Right. I mean you???re an accountant. Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane.,Robert
Yes. I am an accountant.,Kevin
Dwight ??? this is one of the archivists here. I thought maybe we could consult him.,Oscar
Really?,Dwight
Yeah.,Oscar
Well. Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.,Dwight
Schrute Farms did you say? That is a fascinating little chapter of the Civil War.,Archivist
You???ve heard about it?,Oscar
YES! Ha! Prepare to be refuted! Go on.,Dwight
There you go.,Archivist
Families and sweethearts back home waited desperately for letters from the front.,Narrator
Dearest mother I???m sorry it has been so long since my last letter. It is three months since I arrived at Schrute Farms and I fear I may never leave this place alive. Melvin Fifer Garris.,Soldier
Hallowed ground.,Dwight
But the Battle at Schrute Farms was no battle at all. It was a code used by pacifists from both North and South who turned the Pennsylvania farmhouse into an artistic community and a refuge from the war.,Narrator
"[on film] You have to understand. Poets, artists, dancers ??? these kind of men preferred peace to war. These delicate lovely men found a place of refuge among the Schrutes at Schrute Farms. Amidst the macho brutality of war this was a place where dandies and dreamers could put on plays and sing tender ballads and dance in the moonlight. I like to think of Schrute Farms as the Underground Railroad for the sensitive??? and well??? fabulous.",Amanda
Wow. This is so much better than the story you made up.,Oscar
I???ve seen enough.,Dwight
You???re right. There should be a monument to this.,Oscar
Never trust a cookie with a woman???s name. Pecan Sandy. Lorna Doone. Madeline. They???ll just break your heart.,Kevin
[laughing] Kevin!,Robert
Robert I hate to interrupt. But I would love to pitch you one last idea. I call it the Big Mac idea.,Ryan
What?!? No!,Kevin
Big Mac idea. That sounds encouraging.,Robert
"It???s really, really good Robert. Let me explain.",Ryan
No! This is not fair! This is my idea. He???s trying to steal it because he???s jealous of me.,Kevin
Well what is the idea?,Robert
Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside. Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac. And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.,Kevin
You know what? Now I remember. That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea.,Ryan
Oh my. It was just actually cookies the whole time?,Robert
[making pencil imprint] Dammit.,Andy
Hey.,Darryl
You guys came. Where???s everyone else?,Andy
Back at the bus. We were locked out. Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.,Darryl
Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there. I guess he follows orders.,Andy
Yeah sorry everyone else didn???t come. I think they???re just tired. With holes in their shoes. And they have dysentery.,Jim
Even without an audience you???re still at it.,Andy
What are you talking about?,Jim
Our office has a disease. And it goes by many names. Sarcasm. Snark. Wisecracks. You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes. That???s what you did with this trip.,Andy
Andy ??? this whole idea of our situation being just like war? It???s just not true. We just work at a paper company. And you???re our regional manager. And guess what man? You don???t have to prove anything. We like you as regional manager. Andy if you don???t believe me take a look at what???s on my head. I???m wearing a very pink hat. I???ve been getting weird looks all day because I???m pretty sure ???DM does GB??? means something kinda sexual. But guess who???s wearing them? All of us. Just for you man. That???s huge.,Jim
You don???t like the hats?,Andy
They???re terrible.,Jim
I hate myself.,Darryl
"They just didn???t turn out how I wanted. In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird.",Andy
"[voiceover the three walking] The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that???s good because I was basically wrong. I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general. But I guess it???s really more like they???re just people who work in an office and I???m their manager. Yeah that???s really probably a better analogy now that I think about it.",Andy
"Abe and Mary are seated watching the show. [in Lincoln voice] Oh Mary this is wonderful??? Ok Mary stop your scolding. I???ll be quiet. [aside to the audience] I need her like I need a hole in the head! [scattered chuckles from the crowd] [Gabe raises his hand with a finger pointed in the shape of a gun to his head] BANG! Ooh [Gabe falls to the ground and the crowd claps, Gabe picks up the Lincoln hat, bows, runs to the crowd and trades it back for his pink ???DM does GB??? hat and runs off]",Gabe
Haha! There he is. You mind lending a hand? I'm typing up a memo to share your ideas with the board.,Robert
I can do that.,Kevin
Great....ok.,Robert
Your arm feels good on my back.,Kevin
"For some reason, my boss is obsessed with cookies. It's not my specialty. My specialty is pizza. But I'm flexible.",Kevin
Charge!,Andy
Isn't Gettysburg like three hours away?,Kelly
No. It's like two hours and forty-six minutes.,Erin
"It's kind of a haul, so we should probably get going. And tuna, I made a special sandwich for you, guess which kind.",Andy
Tuna?,Jim
Yes! Tuna of the land. Turkey. With pesto.,Andy
And to drink?,Jim
Water.,Andy
"Oh-ho, I am in.",Jim
"I'm excited, I've actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I'm older now, I can outrun a zombie.",Jim
"Getting everyone on the bus, check. Giving everyone hats, check. Sexiest eastern European girls, uh, check.",Andy
"Hey, Devil's Den is that way, we should check it out. That's where the snipers hid.",Darryl
Please! Everyone and their mother goes to Devil's Den. It's the Olive Garden of Gettysburg.,Andy
"Oh, I like Olive Garden.",Phyllis
"Well, I meant that in a bad way. Obviously it tastes good, but it's not cool.",Andy
Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?,Jim
That is what I'm showing you.,Andy
"I know what you guys are all thinking right now: Hey, let's go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? Joke's on you. It only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.",Dwight
"Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face, either.",Dwight
"Guys! Over here, we found the bus.",Oscar
"Open the door, Jim.",Phyllis
It's locked.,Jim
"Are you sure? Yeah, it's locked.",Phyllis
"It's not locked, gimme that...",Dwight
"That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?",Jim
"It's, it's latched closed.",Dwight
"Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I'm gonna find him.",Jim
I'll come with you.,Darryl
Ow! Ee! I sat on my sandwich.,Phyllis
And that's how the printing press was invented.,Oscar
"[enters office doing Michael Jackson impression] Everybody beat it. Don't beat it, stay where you are.",Andy
There you are. Dillinger Graphics said their shipment is late.,Erin
What did you say?,Andy
"Nothing, I just-",Erin
What would you say?,Andy
That it'll be the first shipment out today.,Erin
"That is exactly the right thing to say! Do it! Git-er-done! Phyllis, you just married Joe Order, you're new name is Phyllis Order [fill this order], get it?",Andy
I don't get it.,Phyllis
"Jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four PM today, it has been moved up to now. Yes.",Andy
We didn't have one scheduled.,Jim
"[knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.",Dwight
"Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.",Dwight
Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you???re in a suicide cult.,Dwight
No. No. No. You???re way off on that one.,Creed
Oh yeah?,Dwight
Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.,Oscar
"Hey guys let???s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight???s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he???s never, ever going to go back on it right?",Jim
That???s right Jim.,Dwight
Hey man.,Darryl
[jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey.,Dwight
Taking a load off huh?,Darryl
No. Putting a load on more like it.,Dwight
Good luck with that.,Darryl
Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again],Dwight
[to Angela] Thank you so much. [hums],Dwight
[sees a pole poking out Dwight???s pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet],Jim
What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!,Dwight
Prank! [throws money from Dwight???s wallet on the floor],Jim
Oh that???s real creative.,Dwight
You know what it???s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?,Jim
"I could, but I just don???t feel like it loser.",Dwight
Because you???re sitting?,Jim
Standing.,Dwight
Ok.,Jim
Don???t!,Dwight
Because you???re sitting?,Jim
Standing.,Dwight
You know I have to do this.,Jim
"I know. [Jim pushes him over, Dwight screams]",Dwight
[signing his name] Andrew??? Baines??? Bernard.,Andy
I think you could just do Andy Bernard.,Jim
"Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it???s like taking a test, but I know the answers.",Andy
[loudly knocking on the window] In four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen. [to Mrs. California] There you are! Honey how on earth could you miss the elevator?,Robert
What was that?,Andy
I don???t know. He wasn???t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn???t hire his wife.,Jim
That???s why my foundation ??? The Dream for a Wish Foundation ??? is going to put them out of business. They???re not going to know what hit them.,Ryan
Everyone. I???d like to introduce my wife Mrs. Robert California. Mrs. California this is everyone.,Robert
Hello. Oh call me Susan please.,Susan
Last night at dinner Susan and I were talking about her returning to work. So she???s here today to see if there???s a good fit. Something tells me it just might work out. This is Andy Bernard the regional manager.,Robert
Hello nice to meet you.,Susan
Hey there. It???s a pleasure.,Andy
Andy would you be so kind as to show Susan around the office. Show her the various departments. Find a place where she???ll shine.,Robert
I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We???re 100 percent staffed up.,Andy
Andy. Let???s see if there???s a good fit first. Then we???ll talk.,Robert
Alright.,Andy
"Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.",Dwight
You don???t have to say it if you???re doing it.,Darryl
[laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?,Dwight
Uh weight lifting yeah.,Darryl
Well today???s your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute???s Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?,Dwight
I???ll take a look.,Darryl
Your path from obesity begins right here!,Dwight
"I???ve been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn???t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.",Darryl
"Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.",Dwight
Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.,Andy
Well it was really nice to meet you Brian.,Susan
Actually Ryan.,Ryan
"Oh, Ryan.",Susan
Bitttch!,Ryan
We will start here at Erinville.,Andy
Hi.,Susan
Hoo-hoo!,Erin
Reception. Your classic one-man operation.,Andy
Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.,Erin
I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.,Andy
Two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients. Certainly worth exploring; wouldn???t you agree Andy?,Robert
I???ll explore exploring it.,Andy
Good. It seems like you have this under control. So I???ll just duck out and run the company for a while.,Robert
Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. [Jim laughs nervously] Alright have at it. Let ???er rip. What do you hate about this place?,Andy
Well it???s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.,Jim
Maybe you do. Hi. I???m Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It???s paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.,Dwight
Jim?,Andy
Well it???s not that easy. It???s kind of sometimes difficult.,Jim
It???s the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.,Dwight
I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.,Susan
That is true.,Dwight
You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.,Andy
That???s me.,Dwight
Dwight why don???t you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.,Andy
Maybe over a beer after she???s closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].,Dwight
Well make that a red wine and I???ll tell you my animal rankings [makes gun click noise back].,Susan
Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they???ve ever been to me. What I wouldn???t give for one of Phyllis??? classic room clearing farts right now.,Andy
Ready? What do you think?,Dwight
Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.,Darryl
"You haven???t even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let???s go over membership. I???m going to need the first month???s and the last month???s up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month???",Dwight
Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I???m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.,Darryl
Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire],Dwight
Make a real gym.,Darryl
I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping.,Susan
But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.,Andy
Uh I could work in customer service. HR even.,Susan
Those are fully staffed as well.,Andy
Are you telling me that there???s no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands?,Robert
[laughing nervously] Yes.,Andy
I am the CEO and I am telling an employee of mine what to do.,Robert
Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-,Andy
Robert this is very uncomfortable. Obviously there???s no place for me here. So thank you for trying. Why don???t we just let it go.,Susan
No. Absolutely not. Andrew there must be something you can do. Think.,Robert
There are lots of considerations.,Andy
I would be eternally grateful. It???s not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one.,Robert
Alright. Well then welcome aboard.,Andy
So what happens next?,Susan
We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello?,Andy
[on phone] Say hello grandma.,Robert
Hi gam-gam.,Andy
"Hold one finger up to Susan. You???ll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, ???are you taking your medicine????",Robert
Are you taking your med-meds?,Andy
Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it. [Robert and Andy hang up phones],Robert
You didn???t say goodbye to your grandma.,Susan
We promised we???d never say goodbye.,Andy
Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute???s Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.,Dwight
All I need is another gym. As if I don???t have enough drama.,Oscar
We have a gym at home. It???s called the bedroom.,Phyllis
Who???s spotting who? Don???t use the bike in the corner. That???s Bruce???s. Jeremy says???,Oscar
"Enough Oscar, enough.",Angela
Kelly?,Dwight
I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.,Kelly
That???s okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.,Dwight
Did you bring your passport with you?,Toby
Who walks around with their passport?,Susan
"Well, I do. Always ready for adventure.",Toby
Have you had any?,Susan
No.,Toby
"[sees Susan is busy in the annex] Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away.",Andy
"Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?",Oscar
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.,Andy/Oscar
How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.,Kevin
This is all pathetic.,Angela
"I am not asking, I am ordering.",Andy
How mean are we talking about?,Oscar
"It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.",Andy
Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.,Erin
Here you go. [gives Susan a tiny stapler],Erin
"Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don't have a computer.",Susan
Well that's a sales desk.,Erin
"Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know.",Kevin
"No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.",Jim
That's Gerald. [hands phone to Jim],Oscar
"Oh, wow. So cute.",Jim
"Oh, that is so cute-",Susan
[grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?,Phyllis
"Yeah, he's in a ladle.",Oscar
That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?,Erin
He did it himself.,Oscar
Is that ladle stainless or...,Phyllis
"Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma.",Oscar
"Excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup. [Jim chuckles]",Susan
It's not that kind of ladle.,Oscar
Very cute. [holds out the phone],Jim
"Aw, let me see-",Susan
"[grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.",Oscar
"I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss' wife. Of course, she was married to Robert.",Susan
Your employees don't seem to be taking to me.,Susan
"Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We'll fix this.",Robert
[in robot voice] What is going on?,Andy
"[chuckles] Please. Andrew, my wife... has brought up an issue that requires your attention. So, uh, if you'll excuse me, I should step out, get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night.",Robert
"Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don't you?",Andy
Do you not want me here?,Susan
Why would you say that?,Andy
It's okay. I understand. I'm not sure how I would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either.,Susan
"It's not that, exactly.",Andy
But it is something.,Susan
"Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.",Andy
Why would you not want me working here?,Susan
I don't know. [chuckles],Andy
"I think I understand what you're going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can't he?",Susan
Yes! The dude is an enigma.,Andy
"Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn't he?",Susan
Ah... [stammers],Andy
Got it.,Susan
What do you think you're doing?,Dwight
Getting my sweat on.,Darryl
"I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?",Dwight
"I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.",Darryl
I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?,Dwight
No.,Darryl
Eight minutes!,Dwight
"Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.",Darryl
Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!,Dwight
It's Lejon Brames.,Darryl
That's what I said.,Dwight
"You know, get it right.",Darryl
I know.,Dwight
[to Susan] Cameras...,Andy
"[enters] Oh, still here. Terrific.",Robert
Andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here.,Susan
Well that's a shame.,Robert
It just was one of those things-,Andy
Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine.,Susan
Where did this come from? Did Andy say that?,Robert
"No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him.",Susan
"What's the struggle? He made a great call, hired a great person.",Robert
You sure about that?,Susan
Absolutely.,Robert
No games?,Susan
No games.,Robert
Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me.,Susan
"Okay, enough of this. I mean, really, enough. It's gotten way out of hand. Andrew, this is my wife. Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us, I thank you for. But it is not welcome right now. Just be honest.",Robert
Andy?,Susan
Yes?,Andy
Why do you keep looking at my husband?,Susan
"Andy, just answer the question.",Robert
No games?,Andy
No games.,Robert
"Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, 'in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen.' [laughs]",Andy
You lying son of a bitch!,Robert
Tell my wife you're lying.,Robert
I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.,Andy
"That's not true, is it?",Susan
"No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.",Andy
This is preposterous.,Robert
Robert...,Susan
"Let's get Jim in here. [Jim shoves out of fram in his chair, Robert looks for Jim] Where's Jim?",Robert
He just rolled out and crawled out.,Erin
"Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this.",Robert
"[to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]",Jim
"[sees Jim's abandoned car] That's weird. Well, he's gotta be around here somewhere.",Robert
"[shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?",Jim
Okay. What about your friend?,Creed
Oh boy.,Jim
"This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.",Dwight
"Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.",Darryl
"First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.",Dwight
"Okay, I'm not doing that.",Darryl
Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!,Dwight
I didn't know Darryl joined.,Gabe
Looks that way.,Darryl
Nice pelvic bowl. Deep.,Gabe
Hello Jim. [Jim tries to escape],Robert
"[grabs Jim's leg] No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna!",Andy
So I think you know what we want to know.,Robert
Do I?,Jim
Yes.,Robert
"[mutters] I know, I do.",Jim
"Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness.",Andy
I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...,Jim
"For God's sake, did Robert tell you that he didn't want me working here?",Susan
"That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.",Jim
[laughs] I think we've got ourselves an answer.,Andy
No.,Robert
That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.,Andy
Perfect!,Jim
Jim...,Susan
Yes?,Jim
"Answer the question, please.",Susan
"[sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.",Jim
All right. Thanks.,Robert
Yes. All right. Great. [leaves],Jim
Uh...,Andy
Yeah.,Robert
Yep.,Andy
"[Robert holds the door, she walks through] Thank you. [leaves]",Susan
[claps Andy's shoulder] Heh.,Robert
Andy.,Susan
"Hey, Mrs. California.",Andy
"Hey. Uh, I'm sorry about the position you were put in today.",Susan
"You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.",Andy
"Yeah, I thought we really hit it off.",Susan
Yeah.,Andy
"Well, different circumstances.",Susan
Yeah.,Andy
Who knows?,Susan
Who knows?,Andy
Maybe after all this settles down...,Susan
Totally.,Andy
It's a date.,Susan
Hmm?,Andy
"You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?",Dwight
This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.,Darryl
"Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!",Dwight
"Dwight, come back and spot me.",Darryl
"All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?",Dwight
To push this bar up.,Darryl
"No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?",Dwight
Help me!,Darryl
What do you want!?!,Dwight
To look good for Val!,Darryl
Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.,Dwight
"They say that if you can strengthen your core, it improves your sexual performance. So, you will find me on the Ab-Blaster. And then you will find me blasting...uh, a very nice young woman.",Gabe
Gotta get in shape. I'm doing Ironman next month. And I want him to be attracted to me.,Meredith
"Hey, what are you listening to?",Dwight
"Steve Martin. [laughs, then falls] uh, I'm fine. [grunts]",Gabe
"Um, where's the shower?",Erin
There is no shower.,Dwight
There isn't?,Kathy
"What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.",Dwight
You have got to be kidding me! No shower?!,Oscar
"Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I've already covered the BM of it all. It's miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.",Dwight
"So, Roberto Californio doesn't want to work with his wife. I get it. And, he wants to give his wife a job. Totally get it. What I am struggling with is the part of this that's impossible.",Andy
I love my wife.,Robert
This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley's tie is really the story of the day...,Jim
It's my birthday.,Stanley
"Ok, so that's a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It's pretty smart, right? [walks into Vance Refrigeration office] Hi, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.",Jim
Let me just check with Bob.,Bob's Secretary
"You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I'll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]",Jim
[on phone] Bob? Jim just went into the closet.,Bob's Secretary
Ugh! He's always one step ahead of us! How does he do that?,Andy
This is insulting!,Mrs. California
This whole accusation is insulting. Come on.,Robert
"[Singing as if he were the dolls in his office] Christmas tiiiime is heeeere! [Normal voice] Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I'm Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.",Andy
Who's excited to get their holiday wishes?,Andy
Holiday wishes.,Stanley
"What's that, Stanley?",Andy
We know exactly what holiday you're referring to.,Stanley
It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.,Andy
"I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.",Stanley
I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.,Jim
"I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!",Stanley
What is the status on my wish?,Meredith
"Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.",Andy
What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?,Dwight
"That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon.",Andy
Where? Dark side or light side?,Dwight
Light side.,Andy
Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?,Dwight
"As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront.",Andy
"Thank you, Andy.",Dwight
"So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is.",Andy
"She's not your grandmother, is she?",Jim
"Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?",Andy
Yeah.,Jim
"Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee.",Andy
"That's great. When you know you know. Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man?",Creed
"Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam.",Andy
"I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.",Erin
I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.,Kelly
"Oh no, no. It's fine, Kelly.",Erin
It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.,Kelly
"That's OK, I don't want you to do that.",Erin
"[laughing] Hello, ah. Merry Christmas, Erin. Kelly, Happy Pancha Ganapati.",Robert
"Eww, what is that?",Kelly
"The five day Hindu celebration in December honoring the god Ganesh, Patron of the Arts.",Robert
Cool.,Kelly
"Hey, man.",Kevin
Hey! [Kevin embraces Robert in a tight hug] Oh!,Robert
How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?,Kevin
Kevin?,Oscar
I actually appreciate the human intimacy. Feel like a kitten being cradled by a gorilla.,Robert
Yeah.,Kevin
It's been ten days since I had sexual intercourse.,Robert
"Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up.",Andy
"I hope so. The corporate party was wretched. I am so tired of the Black Eyed Peas. It's rock-n-roll for people who don't like rock-n-roll. It's rap for people who don't like rap. It's pop for people who don't like pop.....ah, heartbreaking. [gestures to Andy in Santa costume]",Robert
"Oh, thank you.",Andy
"Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. [puts on baseball cap that has a foam rear-end on it with the words ???HARD ASS???] But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.",Andy
Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.,Dwight
It wasn't me.,Jim
It wasn't either of you.,Andy
Kathy wants to leave our clump?,Jim
Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.,Andy
"I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]",Dwight
"Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]",Jim
Hey! Hey! Respect the hat!,Andy
Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.,Jim
Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay.,Andy
What was that?,Jim
What is it?,Dwight
"Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person.",Andy
Can't do that.,Jim
"No, absolutely not.",Dwight
You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.,Andy
Hi. I'm Jessica. I'm looking for Andy?,Jessica
"Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. [gets up and hugs Jessica] I'm Erin.",Erin
Oh! [laughs] Oof!,Jessica
"Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.",Erin
Oh.,Jessica
"My ex is meeting my sex....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your penis...that's just part of it.",Andy
"Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you're not talking about my penis. [laughs and kisses Jessica on the cheek] Hi.",Andy
Hi.,Jessica
"Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr.",Andy
Wow.,Erin
"Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist.",Andy
"Oh, that's great. Backbone of the office.",Jessica
"Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.",Erin
What?,Andy
Oh.,Jessica
"Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did. [Jessica laughs, Erin exaggerates back curve]",Erin
Oh no.,Andy
Ah..[laughs],Jessica
"Ut oh, it's kicking in. Spontaneous scoliosis.",Andy
Spontaneous scoliosis. [both laugh],Jessica
Oh.,Erin
"This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution.",Darryl
Thank you.,Val
Alright.,Darryl
Alright.,Val
"Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.",Darryl
Isn't that just for popsicles?,Val
Popsicles?,Darryl
"Yeah, upstairs people? Cause you got a stick up your butt?",Val
"Ah! See, I, I, I thought it was because they're so rich they could all eat popsicles all the time. [laughs] I, in my, I...",Nate
"Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.",Darryl
You had me at ???clookies.??? I can't wait to find out what they are.,Nate
What should I wear?,Val
"Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up.",Darryl
"I will look so handsome for you, Darryl.",Nate
Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room],Jim
"Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.",Jim
"Erin, what can I get for you?",Robert
"Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.",Erin
"Now why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? Did some small part of you want something a little stronger? Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar, come and take these shots!",Robert
Yes!,Ryan
Yes!,Oscar
Will do.,Ryan
"The fifth one is for you, Erin. You could take it or leave it. To take it would be to accept that you're at a party and you're an adult woman, with an adventurous spirit. To leave it would be fine too.",Robert
"One, two three! [group takes shots]",Phyllis
Yes.,Kevin
"OK. [takes shot, group laughs]",Erin
Mmm. Wow.,Robert
Whoo! Jiminy Christmas!,Erin
Jiminey Christmas indeed.,Robert
Hit 'er up.,Erin
Oh.,Robert
Oh yes.,Kevin
Whoo!,Ryan
Yeah! [laughs],Erin
Wow.,Oscar
"[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.",Jim
"So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.",Jim
[laughing] Boom!,Dwight
"But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed...[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do...",Ryan
Good cookie.,Kevin
I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.,Darryl
OK.,Val
I thought you'd wear a sweater.,Darryl
Since when does a sweater mean ???dressed up???? Am I your grandson?,Val
"Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.",Darryl
"As a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, maybe.",Val
"[imitating Stanley] I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. [group laughs] and then I want my nap!",Erin
That's right. [laughs],Stanley
Whoo! [group laughs] Thank you.,Erin
"She, she is remarkable.",Robert
Edgy impressions.,Andy
Thank you.,Erin
How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home.,Andy
A thousand.,Erin
Whoa! Maybe you should take a break.,Andy
[serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding!,Erin
Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!,Dwight
Oh my god.,Toby
"Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!",Dwight
"I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?",Jim
Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?,Dwight
Hmm...,Jim
You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing.,Toby
"Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he's also the world's leading Egyptologist.",Toby
Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.,Angela
"No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.",Toby
Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.,Dwight
"Nice try, this is ridiculous.",Jim
Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.,Dwight
Three times.,Jim
You see?,Dwight
"Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.",Andy
"Andy, you've gotta be kidding me.",Jim
Fingerprints can be planted. You know with a severed hand...,Toby
Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?,Kelly
"OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...",Jim
Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.,Dwight
No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.,Angela
"[on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.",Jim
Come down right away!,Dwight
"[on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?",Jim
"Yes, I was quilled.",Dwight
And what's it's name?,Jim
Henrietta.,Dwight
Oops. [hangs up],Jim
"What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.",Andy
"Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK? [Andy and Jessica laugh] And you both have such beautiful hair.",Erin
[laughs] Thank you.,Jessica
"I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.",Erin
OK!,Andy
"And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. [blows kisses and pushes Andy and Jessica's faces together.] Ah! [laughs] OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say ???get a drink???. [blows kisses and dances away]",Erin
"That's uh, that's the girl you dated.",Jessica
"Um, yeah, she's not always like that. It's um...",Andy
"No, she, she seems fine.",Jessica
"Yeah, uh, excuse me.",Andy
OK.,Jessica
Yep. [leaves Jessica to talk to Erin] Hey!,Andy
Hey.,Erin
Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?,Andy
Every martini has an olive.,Erin
OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.,Andy
"I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.",Kevin
"Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.",Erin
"Ah, OK.",Andy
It's about you.,Erin
"That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.",Andy
[slurring slightly] It's that I wish Jessica was dead.,Erin
"You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something.",Andy
I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.,Erin
"Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back.",Andy
"Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar? [Andy leaves]",Erin
Hey.,Kevin
Hey.,Erin
"So, there was talk of oatmeal.",Kevin
"You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.",Phyllis
Yeah. Thanks.,Val
I swear...,Andy
Did you not...,Jessica
I was too embarrassed! [group laughs],Andy
"Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?",Jim
Is that Cici?,Phyllis
Yes. It is.,Jim
Um.,Andy
That's awful.,Phyllis
Cici is Jim's daughter.,Andy
Oh my god. How could somebody do that?,Jessica
"I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.",Jim
Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?,Oscar
I don't-,Jim
I know who did this....Dwight.,Andy
Dwight?,Phyllis
Yeah.,Jim
Dwight.,Andy
No!,Oscar
He should pay.,Phyllis
Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able.,Andy
O...K.,Jim
"It's, I mean.",Andy
"Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it???s a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...",Jim
That's no accident.,Oscar
Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.,Jim
What?,Phyllis
What?,Oscar
"I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.",Jim
"Enough of this garbage. [harshly places boom box on table and hits play] This is Christmas. [Christmas Eve by Trans-Siberian Orchestra plays. Dwight plays air violin/guitar and sings along] Hi-yah!!!!! [gabe, Creed and Nate join in as shots show various gift giving] Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!",Dwight
"You alright, Santa?",Jim
"You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends?",Andy
Yes.,Jim
Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?,Andy
"Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.",Jim
"No...I don't, hmm, I don't know.",Andy
OK.,Jim
"By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.",Andy
Alright. I will definitely do that.,Jim
"Alright, I'll tell Dwight.",Andy
"You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.",Jim
Christmas miracles do happen.,Andy
Yes. They totally do.,Jim
"You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses.",Ryan
"Well help me, OK? Just, uh take...",Kelly
I'm trying but you need to-,Ryan
Hey.,Erin
Yo.,Kelly
Game on.,Erin
On it.,Kelly
"[group laughing] I don't know what I was thinking, it was awful...",Jessica
"Jessica, did you just fart? [group stops laughing]",Kelly
"And that, is how it's done.",Kelly
I would like another alcohol.,Erin
"Let's you and I take a walk. Oscar, you're in charge of the bar.",Robert
"What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?",Oscar
Your heart is broken. So is mine.,Robert
And...,Erin
And what?,Robert
And you have any advice or anything?,Erin
No [laughs] my god.,Robert
...Help me feel better...,Erin
"I've been married thrice and each has ended in an acrimonious divorce, I'm not sure I'm the best person to give love advice....I was hoping you were gonna make me feel better.",Robert
"When you do your makeup,",Nate
Uh huh.,Jessica
"How long you, does it take usually? Cause...",Nate
"Um, it ta-, um it depends.",Jessica
???..Chad Flendermen's kryptonite. [Darryl walks up to Toby and Val in a tuxedo],Toby
Whoa. We got a real Clarence Thomas here.,Creed
Hi.,Darryl
I'll see you at home?,Jessica
OK great.,Andy
OK,Jessica
Perfect.,Andy
Bye [kiss]...I still don't get why you can't just call her a cab and pay for it.,Jessica
"I would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish.",Andy
Oh,Jessica
Either he drives or I drive. Now I'm drunk and mad.,Meredith
OK [laughs] Bye.,Jessica
"OK, bye. [helps Meredith off the floor] Alright Meredith,",Andy
Thank you Santa.,Meredith
You bet.,Andy
"Thank god Erin's getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed. [laughs] and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,",Andy
"Let's go, let's go.",Andy
"I know, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.",Meredith
Hang on.,Andy
"Alright. [Andy opens back of her van, things fall out]",Meredith
What?,Andy
Whoa! My stuff!,Meredith
What is all that?,Andy
It's my valuables!,Meredith
It's junk!,Andy
"This is my treasures, no they're my treasures!",Meredith
You're a hoarder. My god!,Andy
"No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful.",Meredith
Ah! My Santa suit's stuck.,Andy
"[laughs while spray painting ???Jim is Awesome??? on his own car, talks to porcupine in carrier] What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?",Dwight
Where are we? This ain't my street.,Meredith
"Sh, sh, sh, sh, shh.",Andy
"Ah, this is the posh part of town, huh?",Meredith
Oh my god.,Andy
Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood?,Meredith
"Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now.",Andy
"Erin, it was great fun tonight. Take a few aspirin and a whole lot of water, sleep in in the morning.",Robert
"Thank you, goodnight.",Erin
What are you smiling for? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?,Meredith
I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home.,Andy
Ow! Take it easy.,Meredith
Whoo.,Andy
"[yawns, ???Idiot??? is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?",Dwight
Dwight.,Oscar
"Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?",Dwight
"Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin'.",Jim
Where can I get a drink? Oh...,Robert
"Oh, uh. Well, we thought we wouldn't put the alcohol out till 11AM. It's just...common...decency.",Andy
Par for the course. Par for the...freaking course. I'll be in the party room having a cookie until 11. Haha! Yule-log.,Robert
"Not destroyed. No..... Not destructive. Quite...off-kilter, sure. But... that's too vague. [long pause] Erratic. Darkly erratic. [laughs awkwardly] That's my mood.",Robert
Cake?...You seem a little down.,Meredith
I am. [laughs] I'm a mess.,Robert
How about I fix you some warm milk with some bourbon?,Meredith
"Oh, that sounds nice.",Robert
Maybe watch a movie...under a blanket...,Meredith
"Lovely. Wait, where is this taking place?",Robert
The Murphy bed of my basement.,Meredith
What...is happening to me? [pause] The lines in your haggard face are paths that lead nowhere. Your hair is the fire of hell. [hugs Meredith] I sincerely hope you find a sexual partner tonight.,Robert
"It's come to my attention that someone, who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.",Andy
Cathy wants to leave our clump?,Jim
Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.,Andy
Hey. Enjoy your new clump.,Dwight
Thanks.,Kathy
"It's so much closer to the bathroom, right?",Dwight
Yeah.,Kathy
Uh huh.,Dwight
Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.,Jim
"No, I just have more room.",Kathy
That's ok.,Jim
You'll be fine over there.,Dwight
"[talking loudly] Sorry guys, Jim! This package came for you, do you want me to put it on your desk?",Erin
"That'd be great, thank you. [Erin throws package, it hits Kathy. She thinks it was Jim who threw it]",Jim
"So, I got this bucket from Jim's garage and I filled it with everything disgusting. Except excrement. I can't wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face. [laughs, then camera shows bucket being dumped on Kathy] Dammit Kathy!",Dwight
"For the past month, I have been collecting wishes from everyone in the office, and I intend to make good on every single one of them.",Andy
"Oh, I see.",Andy
"Now look, I may not have a great laugh like Santa, or a flying sled. But tell you what I do have. A Prius, a heart of freaking gold....",Andy
This.,Kevin
"Alright, you got it.",Andy
...and an American Express green card.,Andy
"Ryan, for your holiday wish, you wanted ten sick days.",Andy
I'd be satisfied with eight.,Ryan
Well I'll do you one better.,Andy
Nine?,Ryan
I got you health insurance.,Andy
"Oh, neat.",Ryan
"Yeah! Right? But with great perks come great responsibility, so I'm gonna be expecting a lot more from you...no more zoning out in your office.",Andy
"Oh, great.",Ryan
Yes!,Andy
Oh yeah!,Kevin
Aw!,All
Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.,Dwight
You really have to say 'oh yeah' every time you eat a candy bar?,Oscar
"I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah!",Kevin
"All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.",Jim
It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!,Andy
You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.,Dwight
"Okay, done.",Jim
[shows bloody hand] Does anyone have a first aid kit?,Erin
Check out this song I wrote: I'ma love you downstairs tonight... [overlapping chatter],Darryl
"All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-",Jim
"[writing on board] Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?",Andy
You can write a book about chairs.,Jim
"Books! Excellent, Jim.",Andy
"Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-",Oscar
"[gasps] Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? [scattered applause]",Andy
Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.,Jim
"I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply!",Andy
"Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?",Angela
Yes!,Andy
"Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.",Andy
"Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.",Dwight
Dwight Schrute for Robert California!,Dwight
"Oh, hello Mr. Schrute. I'll tell him you're here. Can I get you anything at all?",Receptionist
I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.,Dwight
"Ooh. I'm glad you're on our team. Here, please have a seat.",Receptionist
Dwight? What are you doing here?,Gabe
Gabe? You don't know?,Dwight
Course I know.,Gabe
"Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.",Dwight
"Corporate says to me, ???Gabe, we need you in Scranton.??? Scranton says, ???Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there.??? So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying.",Gabe
Dwight.,Robert
Robert.,Dwight
You made it.,Robert
Yes.,Dwight
"Impressive initiative. I don't know what's worse, the trip or the destination. [Gabe laughs] Well, uh, let me settle in and I'll be with you shortly.",Robert
Very good.,Dwight
"Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to 'play ball.' Those were his words.",Andy
"Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!",Oscar
So make that error!,Andy
"Andy, no-",Oscar
Hey! I can make that error.,Kevin
[clicks tongue] Aw...,Oscar
"Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that.",Andy
"No, I-",Kevin
"It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. [to Oscar] What do you say?",Andy
I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.,Oscar
Oh.,Andy
"Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!",Oscar
What?,Andy
"It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.",Oscar
You know what? Go. Have fun.,Andy
There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.,Andy
Stop right there. I love it.,Jim
I'm in.,Darryl
I didn't even say what it is.,Andy
It's trivia.,Darryl
In Philadelphia.,Jim
"But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase...",Andy
That's a great idea.,Jim
That's a great plan.,Darryl
Yeah? You like it?,Andy
Yeah.,Jim
All right.,Andy
"All right, good stuff.",Jim
"I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, 'this sounds really stupid.'",Andy
"You just made a good idea, a great idea.",Darryl
There is one problem with this plan.,Andy
What?,Darryl
"We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.",Andy
[on the phone] You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. [hangs up],Gabe
"Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.",Dwight
Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question: What's the most important appliance in your house?,Gabe
Meat grinder.,Dwight
"[makes buzzer sound] Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential.",Gabe
"You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.",Dwight
"Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be able to meet with you, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO.",Robert
But I can give you this pitch in one minute-,Dwight
"No, he's going to meet with you later. No, no, no. I don't want you to rush it, okay? Trust me. Meet with Bill. He's a great person to know. I'll dialogue with him tonight. [leaves]",Robert
CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes.,Gabe
Still an important position. Still a chief.,Dwight
"You're really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. [Dwight sighs, Gabe's phone rings] Hallway phone, Gabe Lewis speaking.",Gabe
"Gabe, listen to me. Don't bother Bill with this. He has to go put out a fire on the home front. Just wait twenty minutes and then I want you to listen to Dwight's pitch. Make him feel valued. Make him feel heard.",Robert
Your wish is my command.,Gabe
It's a command.,Robert
"I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?",Oscar
"You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.",Andy
What? No!,Oscar
I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it.,Andy
And you guys thought this was a good idea?,Oscar
I thought it was a fun idea.,Jim
"There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar.",Darryl
"Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?",Andy
Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?,Oscar
No. Nah.,All
What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night? [laughs],Oscar
It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. [Oscar???s friend walks up] Not anything.,Andy
Good luck.,Oscar
"Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.",Andy
Good-timers follow me.,Meredith
Backups. [Jim goes to join the backups],Phyllis
"Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here.",Stanley
A-team.,Andy
Okay.,Jim
"All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except... [looks at Kevin, who has joined the A-team]",Andy
Okay. [leaves],Kevin
There's a table over here.,Jim
"All right, first question everyone: Ray Charles famously had this state on his mind. What is its capital?",Host
"Oh, we got this!",Andy
Let's reverse engineer this. You're a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where you're a novelty. Alaska?,Creed
Atlanta.,Stanley
"Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held.",Phyllis
My cousins were actually at those Olympics.,Cathy
Keep talking all you want.,Stanley
"How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?",Kevin
"Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.",Erin
"Okay, time's up. Let's get the boards up. 'Atlanta, Georgia' is the correct answer. [Kevin holds up ???What is...SEE-attle???]",Host
"Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-",Gabe
[sniffs] There's no fires within eight miles of here.,Dwight
"Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf.",Gabe
"What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!",Dwight
This must be very frustrating.,Receptionist
I can see you in the jungle now.,Gabe
"Okay, now, you're not an all-star of the NBA, but you did get your game on when you won the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award in 2011. Who are you?",Host
"Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine.",Andy
Shawn Marion.,Jim
"Yes, Shawn Marion.",Darryl
"That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.",Ryan
"Wrong, for so many reasons.",Jim
"Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?",Phyllis
That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river.,Stanley
"Ron Artest, Kelly.",Kevin
"No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.",Kelly
"All right, boards up. Let's see who got it. 'Lamar Odom' is what we were looking for. 'Lamar Odom' Thank you. [scattered cheers]",Host
"Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.",Jim
Nicely done!,Kevin
"You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen.",Andy
"Chill, man. This plan is airtight.",Darryl
"So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!",Dwight
"Well, you got my vote.",Receptionist
Oh my God.,Dwight
I know.,Gabe
"Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?",Dwight
What?,Gabe
What's with the smile?,Dwight
"You're doing great. You know, so good.",Gabe
"And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.",Dwight
"Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! [Gabe makes a flushing motion, Dwight twists Gabe's arm] Ow!",Gabe
Take me to Robert.,Dwight
Ow! He went home.,Gabe
Take me to his house.,Dwight
"Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing.",Gabe
You know where it is. Lead me there.,Dwight
"Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help!",Gabe
"Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.",Dwight
"Excuse me, sir, on the Dunder-Mifflin A-team? Excuse me, sir?",Host
Yeah?,Ryan
"I'm sure you're just checking your Grindr account... [laughter] but you can't check smart phones during trivia, it's against the rules.",Host
"Okay, I'm turning it off.",Ryan
"Okay, you're not turning it off.",Host
I won't look at it.,Ryan
Sir?,Host
I can't- I can't not touch it.,Ryan
"Okay, then we're going to have to take it away. [employee takes the phone] Thank you.",Host
"Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone. [leaves]",Ryan
"All right, guys. After nine rounds, let's check the scores. In first place, with nine points, it's Aesop's Foibles. [Oscar's team touches fingers] The Queerenstein Bears have seven points. [a team of hairy men growl] Dunder-Mifflin A-Team has four points.",Host
[claps] All right.,Jim
D.M. Backup Team has three points. The Einsteins have eight points. [the 'just-for-fun??? Dunder-Mifflin team cheers] Ladies Gaga have five points. [more cheering],Host
"So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.",Andy
Which one is it?,Dwight
I don't know. All I know is the building.,Gabe
Robert! Robert California! Robert!,Dwight
Dwight! How nice of Gabe to show you where I live. Come around. 102.,Robert
"All right guys, time's up. Who was the relatively unknown patent clerk who discovered that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared? Looks like everyone gets a point for Albert Einstein. Oh wait. Except for the Einsteins. That's all right. Which means the top three teams are going to finish it off in the speed round. So let's get everyone some bells. In third place we have the Einsteins.",Host
Oh yeah!,Kevin
What! [cheers],Kelly
"In second place, we have the Queerenstein Bears.",Host
Whoo! Let's go!,Queerenstein Bears
"And, in first place, is Aesop's Foibles.",Host
Whoo!,Oscar's friend
"Yeah, we're going to get clobbered.",Darryl
Ring it in when you know it. First question: This man had a fatwa declared on him when- [Erin rings bell] Einsteins?,Host

What is it?,Erin

Flying jib is correct for the Einsteins. [cheers and applause],Host
"Shalom. [sighs] Give us just a minute. Stu and I are just finishing up our lesson. Trust me. One nine-minute bout is a cardiovascular equivalent of running uphill for three hours.

Grab my knee!,Stu
Yay Robert!,Gabe

No thank you.,Dwight
"Sit down, Dwight.",Robert
"Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, 'table for one?' How is this possible?",Dwight
You were dining alone? All those people are you?,Robert
"Yes, exactly. Riddle number two: Who is going-",Dwight
"Ah-ah-ah- your drive, your ambition. It would be wasted on a manager's job. And Florida, you don't want to live here. Even I don't want to live here. That's why I'm always at my place in Scranton. Florida is America's basement: It's wet, it's filled with mold, strange insects, alligators. Alligators are dinosaurs, Dwight. You know that, right?",Robert
N... it's complicated.,Dwight
"[holds a medal to the light] This medal was my grandfather's. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It's a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better? [holds out medal]",Robert
"It's a job interview, not a flea market.",Dwight
"Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I'll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place.",Robert
Yes.,Dwight
Final round. Last two teams squaring off. I hope you're ready to play doctor. Our question is about health and the human body.,Host

"Cause it's like, really...",Kelly
Einsteins! Great work.,Andy
Thank you.,Kevin

"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.",Oscar
"Andy, we're fine. We don't wanna switch. We're already like, the perfect unit.",Kevin

"Hey, is it true that you're not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of Tu Bishvat?",Kelly

"Alright, if you're not going to help us out by buying our own paper, could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today? That would be amazing.",Andy
"Andy, it's the last day of the quarter. We've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.",Jim
"Not helping, tuna.",Andy
"Yeah, I'm sitting on twenty-five hundred in sales I can make at any time but those are my wait till the separation is legal sales.",Stanley
We gotta figure this out. Think of the look on Robert's face when we tell him we met our 8% goal.,Andy
"Oh, will we get to see that look?",Kevin
"No, that's why...that's why I said think of it.",Andy
"Andy, we're gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.",Jim
Yeah.,Group
"Yeah, it is, Andy.",Angela
Have I mentioned that it's also quite good for amateur animation? [flips crude animation of stick figures representing him and Robert] Took me two weeks.,Andy
"Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs]",Dwight
"It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.",Jim
"Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the- [opens drawer full of meatballs]",Dwight
You've been meatballed! [laughs],Stanley
Ugh.,Dwight
Are you ready for some meatball?,Stanley

I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...",Andy
"[Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.",Jim
"Oh, who needs a house that size?",Oscar
Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.,Dwight
"I'm selling the house, actually.",Robert
"You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.",Jim
"It's mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and I've got the most expensive house on the market. The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room. [Jim laughs] Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim?",Robert
"I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.",Jim
What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard?,Robert
"I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.",Jim
"Oh yes. How hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. Very funny, Jim. I get it.",Robert
"Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.",Andy
A beautiful monster cost me my forties and my dream home. I think I'm entitled to the occasional bad day.,Robert
"Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.",Andy
"Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs]",Kevin
"Kevin, no.",Oscar
"What, as some sort of last hoorah?",Robert
"Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.",Kevin
"You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow. Let's try this: everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. Let's just call it a get-together. And let's say no food.",Robert
"Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?",Kevin
"That was you, Kevin.",Oscar
It was me.,Kevin
"You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.",Meredith
"Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.",Erin
It's no problem. You live right near me.,Meredith
How do you know where I live?,Erin
Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.,Meredith
Why?,Erin
He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.,Meredith
Oh. Come on.,Erin
Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks],Erin
"[sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm.",Angela
It's almost too warm.,Cathy
"I'm feeling eighty-two, eighty-two and a half.",Gabe
"Oh, so close. Eighty-one.",Ryan
"[to Cathy] Well, we'll say its eight-two and it'll be our secret.",Gabe
"[to Jim] Hey, late guy.",Cathy
Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.,Jim
Oh.,Andy
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.,Jim
"You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.",Jim
"Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.",Jim
You should see the whole thing.,Robert
"I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.",Jim
I'm just about to give the tour.,Robert
All right-,Jim
Join us. You must see what you were laughing about.,Robert
I must...,Jim
[looks at pool] Wow.,Jessica
"[hides ring] Yeah, it's pretty serious poolage.",Andy
[sees Andy's hand in his pocket] What are you doing?,Jessica
Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh],Andy
Gross. I'm getting a drink. Do you want anything?,Jessica
"No, I'm good.",Andy
[runs to Andy] Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.,Erin
Hi.,Andy
How is everything? How's your car?,Erin
It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.,Andy
Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?,Erin
"Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.",Andy
"Oh, like a goodbye trip.",Erin
No. What?,Andy
Hey.,Jessica
Hi.,Erin
"I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.",Erin
Val. You made it.,Darryl
"Yup, yup.",Val
"Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?",Darryl
"You know, you are just as dumb at night.",Val
Mmm. [they clink cups],Darryl
"All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.",Andy
"No, show me.",Jessica
Okay.,Andy
Dive in right here.,Jessica
In a minute. In a minute.,Andy
Okay. You don't know what you're doing.,Jessica
A minute would be cool.,Andy
"Hey, Dwight Snoot.",Erin
What-,Dwight
What you doing?,Erin
I'm relaxing. Scram. [pushes her],Dwight
Ow.,Erin
"Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?",Andy
I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.,Stanley
"Where... [finds pants, looks for ring]",Andy
"Come on, don't you want to play?",Erin
Oh really?,Dwight
Yeah.,Erin
"Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]",Dwight
Whoa.,Kevin
Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!,Angela
"Here we have the parlor. I imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. This was the gateway. You enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it you're simply a penis, a vagina, hunger, ache. Susan used it as a Pilates studio.",Robert
[sees wine collection] Holy cow!,Oscar
Wine collection.,Robert
How many bottles? Three hundred?,Oscar
"[laughs] About twelve hundred. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers.",Robert
Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.,Oscar
"Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau.",Toby
"Robert, you are too kind.",Ryan
Oh.,Robert
Too kind doesn't begin to cover it.,Gabe
"With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.",Ryan
And Gabe-y makes three.,Gabe
"Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.",Jim
"Jim, come see this next room. I think you especially would like it.",Robert
Really? Why?,Jim
I don't know. Maybe not. Just come.,Robert
[Dwight dunks her] Oh!,Erin
"[laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?",Dwight
"Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.",Erin
I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up],Dwight
[giggles] Oh Dwight!,Erin
[giggles] Stop.,Erin
You stop.,Dwight
"No, you stop.",Erin
"No, you stop.",Dwight
[to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop.,Erin
"Okay, you can stop.",Dwight
"No, no, no, he's not looking.",Erin
"No, you can stop.",Dwight
You can actually stop.,Erin
"Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?",Kelly
The main stone's missing.,Meredith
I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.,Kelly
"I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan.",Robert
Good night.,Jim
[raises wine bottle] To the kitchen!,Oscar
To the kitchen!,All
To the kitchen. Onward!,Robert
"Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?",Oscar
Note? It's a symphony.,Toby
"Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.",Oscar
I would love that.,Toby
"Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right?",Toby
"[to Val] You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.",Darryl
"You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice.",Meredith
You in?,Val
"Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in.",Darryl
"I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.",Darryl
"[he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...",Dwight
Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.,Erin
Damn it.,Dwight
What is the most romantic possible thing?,Erin
We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.,Dwight
"Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you.",Erin
Yes! [they high five and jump in the pool],Both
You're in my way!,Angela
"Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.",Erin
Chicken fight!,Dwight
No thanks.,Andy
Dang it! What the heck already?,Erin
"Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!",Dwight
"Okay, yeah. Who's going to be my partner? Where's Jim?",Cathy
"I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.",Kevin
Yeah- oh!,Dwight
[knocks Cathy off Kevin's shoulders] Yes! Woo!,Erin
Woohoo! Yes!,Dwight
"Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.",Erin
I know. I could just bang you right now.,Dwight
He's not looking. [Dwight dumps her in the pool] Hey!,Erin
I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears.,Robert
To both these bears.,Jim
To both these bears.,Ryan
Bears.,Toby
To both these bears.,Oscar
"When I put in the screening room, I bought three movies: Caligula, Last Tango in Paris, and Emmanuelle 2. Last two movies I actually watched in here Marley and Me and On Golden [bleep] Pond.",Robert
"I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.",Ryan
Yup. We could watch some right now if you want. I got a Korean film on my iPod if you want to just- if you have the cables.,Gabe
"Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found.",Andy
"Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it.",Kelly
I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?,Andy
Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?,Kelly
"The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?",Andy
"Oh, I don't think you're being silly.",Phyllis
Oh God. [takes off ring],Kelly
"You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.",Andy
[snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.,Phyllis
[to Andy] Come on. Let's chicken fight those two.,Jessica
[comes up from under water] How was that?,Val
Okay. Watch my toes. [does hand stand],Kevin
Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.,Darryl
"No, I'm good. Thank you.",Val
Cool.,Darryl
Cool. [to Kevin] Does Darryl not swim?,Val
"That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.",Kevin
[knocks Erin off Dwight's shoulders] Yes!,Jessica
Yeah!,Andy
[to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break.,Dwight
"Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.",Erin
Okay.,Dwight
One more?,Erin
Yeah!,Andy
Yeah! Great! [others cheer and clap],Jessica
"Mush, mush, mush! Come on!",Erin
Go!,Dwight
Go! Okay. Yeah.,Erin
Here we go! [knocks Erin over] Yes!,Jessica
Yay! [Erin comes back up] Whoa!,Andy
Wow!,Kevin
I cannot believe you're still up!,Andy
I cannot believe it either.,Jessica
I've got this! [Dwight gasps] Charge! Go! Go! [Dwight sinks],Erin
"[muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-",Andy
"[coughs up water] Erin, did we win?",Dwight
Sure. Sure we did.,Erin
You're lying. We didn't win.,Dwight
"Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest.",Erin
"You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets fire to paper ring boat]",Kelly
We're in the pool!,Angela
"Shut it, Angela.",Meredith
"Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.",Dwight
"Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday.",Andy
"I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.",Dwight
Mmm.,Andy
"So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.",Dwight
"Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me.",Andy
Not what I asked.,Dwight
We're done. Erin and I are over.,Andy
"So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.",Dwight
Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.,Andy
[sighs] You're an idiot.,Dwight
"Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles]",Kevin
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.,Erin
No!,Kevin
Oh I've got him!,Val
Cannonball! [jumps in pool] Let's do this!,Darryl
[Erin swims up with ring] Wow.,Andy
So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.,Erin
Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?,Andy
The Bernard family seal. Duh.,Erin
Duh.,Andy
Sorry if your special night was ruined.,Erin
"Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night.",Andy
"Oh, you weren't going to do that?",Erin
"Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you.",Andy
"Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.",Erin
"And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness.",Robert
To madness.,Jim
To madness.,Ryan
To madness. [Robert laughs],Toby
To madness.,Meredith
"Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?",Jim
"Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl.",Meredith
Are you serious?,Jim
"Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.",Ryan
And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like.,Gabe
"[Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!",Oscar
And I am Bacchus's friend!,Toby
"Gentlemen, bear witness. While I've been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. This is no get-together. This is a party. [Robert strips, jumps in pool, Gabe and Ryan join him]",Robert
Yes! Woohoo! Bravo!,All
And there's my talking point.,Jim
"Yes, that's it. Push yourselves, boys. It's not a party if you don't do something that scares you. I need a breather. Oh. Oh. You two keep going.",Robert
"Hey, he's asleep. We can just leave.",Ryan
So leave.,Gabe
"Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?",Ryan
What's the water like?,Kathy
Nice.,Darryl
"Oh, it is warm.",Angela
"Robert's house is, well....I don't mean to sound offensive, but it's like where a basketball player would live.",Phyllis
"Oh, Dwight.",Erin
Uh huh.,Dwight
That feels so good!,Erin
Yeah....baby.,Dwight
"[grunting] Hey, Andy.",Erin
Hey.,Andy
Dwight gives the best back massages.,Erin
"Yeah, it sounds like it.",Andy
"Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?",Dwight
"I don't know, why don't you check me Dr. Shrute. [laughing]",Erin
"No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It's like the devil's cursive.",Dwight
You mean more like dangerous curves...,Erin
You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...[pushes Erin back to floor],Dwight
Ow!,Erin
"You date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. It's over. You start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. He says no. Then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. Then he ignores you at a pool party? Am I right ladies?",Erin
"[Erin helps Dwight stretch his inner thighs] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.",Dwight
You guys ready?,Jessica
Bring it on guys.,Andy
Yeah...,Dwight
Let's go before I vomit. [Erin and Dwight enter pool],Andy
Ready?,Dwight
I'm ready.,Erin
Whoo!,Jessica
Alright! Here we go.,Andy
Ok.,Erin
RAHHH!!!!!!!,Dwight
"Yeah, come on!",Jessica
Get her! Ruin her! [Andy and Jessica beat Dwight and Erin],Dwight
Hey! High-five!,Andy
Yeah!,Jessica
"My brother and I were the chicken fight champions of our swim club growing up. I mean, we beat the Strauss twins. Ok, I guess somebody didn't grow up in west Hartford, Connecticut.",Jessica
"This room I liked for the view. I dreamed that I would watch my guests walk to their cars at dawn, their faces flushed with the shame and regret for the choices they made the night before. [laughs]",Robert
I get that.,Ryan
Beautiful sentiment.,Gabe
To the shame room! [raises bottle],Jim
[Robert laughs] I live in this room.,Gabe
"[Toby and Oscar swig from wine bottles] Oh, Mineral-ey.",Oscar
Mineral-ey.,Toby
"Val, I need the space.",Andy
"All right guys, clear out.",Val
Everybody out.,Andy
Promise me you're going to clean up.,Val
I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do.,Andy
Promise me that-,Val
Obviously I'm going to clean up.,Andy
"Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, 'Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance,' and then you have to be like, 'Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!' And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. [dances to Kenny Loggin's Footloose] Sex also works.",Andy
Hey! Jim's back from jury duty.,Erin
Hey! Tuna! He's back.,Andy
Hey.,Jim
"Oh, look at this. [hugs Jim] Tuna wrap.",Andy
Okay.,Jim
[grabs Jim's wrist] Hand roll.,Andy
Yeah.,Jim
How was jury duty?,Phyllis
"It was pretty uneventful, actually.",Jim
Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.,Dwight
What was the case?,Erin
"Uh, hit and run.",Jim
"Ooh, 'the case of the hit and run,' that's exciting.",Erin
Did you send him to the slammer?,Phyllis
Nope. Not guilty.,Jim
"Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] 'Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm.'",Dwight
"We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.",Jim
"Not coming, have plans.",Dwight
Okay.,Jim
"I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.",Jim
Ah! Angela had the baby!,Erin
Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.,Kevin
Why?,Darryl
You know.,Kevin
Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?,Darryl
"A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.",Kevin
"Eh, a little bit.",Ryan
"Oh, did I win the pool?",Kevin
"Ah, no. Right month, wrong year.",Erin
Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.,Oscar
We should all go to the hospital and visit her.,Erin
"Oh, I'd love to but, um-",Phyllis
"Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.",Jim
"Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.",Oscar
"Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.",Kevin
"Everyone, our very own Angela-",Gabe
"We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.",Oscar
"Oh, I am so in.",Gabe
I love maternity wards. It's the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right.,Gabe
"Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?",Andy
"Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-",Jim
How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.,Meredith
"Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles.",Stanley
"Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.",Phyllis
"Wow, I'm really sorry.",Jim
Yeah.,Phyllis
I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.,Jim
"[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.",Jim
"You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernesto's.",Toby
"Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.",Jim
You mean food truck. Ernesto's was a food truck.,Toby
"Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas.",Meredith
"I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.",Dwight
"[whispering] Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.",Oscar
"Got that, bimbo?",Kevin
"Got it, bimbo. [Oscar knocks at the door]",Erin
Yes?,Angela
"Knock, knock. Oh!",Oscar
Hi!,Kevin
Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?,Angela
We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.,Oscar
"Well, meet our not-so-little bundle of joy, Philip Halsted Lipton.",Senator Lipton
Phillip is so fat.,Kevin
Kevin!,Oscar
"You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.",Kevin
Hey.,Angela
"Yes, he's substantial.",Senator Lipton
He's more than substantial. He's a monster.,Erin
"So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...",Dwight
Mm-hmm.,Jim
And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?,Dwight
Mm-hmm.,Jim
"See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert!",Dwight
"Okay, wait, wait.",Jim
"Yes! Andy, get out here.",Dwight
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.,Jim
I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.,Dwight
"What's up, gangstas?",Andy
Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!,Dwight
"Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory.",Andy
I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-,Dwight
"No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.",Andy
I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.,Dwight
"Here, right there. [mimes giving Dwight a pill and a glass] Down the hatch.",Andy
I really don't want to take the chill pill. [mimes taking pill],Dwight
"Attaboy. Good. Now, chill.",Andy
"Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?",Dwight
"Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu. [Jim laughs nervously]",Andy
That's good enough for me. [exhales again],Dwight
"...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.",Jim
I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before.,Andy
Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.,Jim
"No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?",Andy
No.,Jim
Do you know why you never heard of it?,Andy
No.,Jim
Covered it up.,Andy
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?,Jim
They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.,Andy
"My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.",Andy
[pulls food truck up to where Dwight and Nate are standing] Where you want I park?,Ernesto
"Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas]",Dwight
Ernesto!,Toby
Hola Toby! [mimes choking],Ernesto
"Yeah, hey.",Toby
Como esta? [speaks Spanish],Ernesto
"Uh, I'm going to say 'I' when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of 'he says blah, blah, blah,' I'm going to say 'I say, blah, blah, blah,' but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, 'He remembers Toby.' [makes face] 'I remember Toby.'",Nate
"Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?",Dwight
Uh-,Jim
It's the empanada guy.,Toby
The empanada guy!,Jim
"No, Toby! [bleep] Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. [sighs] Ask him if he remembers Jim. [Nate asks Ernesto a question in Spanish]",Dwight
No.,Ernesto
"He says, 'No.'",Nate
"He says, 'No!' Boom!",Dwight
"Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.",Andy
"Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish]",Dwight
"Ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets.",Nate
"Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.",Jim
"Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.",Creed
"Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?",Dwight
Why? Everybody's heard it.,Andy
Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?,Dwight
"Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.",Andy
Why?,Phyllis
Why? Why? [looks at Jim],Andy
Because my car broke down.,Jim
"His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse.",Andy
"Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?",Dwight
"Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.",Andy
"[to Ernesto] I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?",Phyllis
We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?,Andy
"Well, I think you handled it pretty well.",Jim
"I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your [bleep].",Andy
"Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.",Jim
[sighs] I don't even know what the truth is anymore.,Andy
"Wow, it's so... healthy.",Oscar
I'm going to call him Little Kevin.,Kevin
"No, you will not.",Angela
Is he really five pounds?,Erin
Mm-hmm.,Angela
"Because I squat with five pounds. This- [squats, grunts] yeah, this feels like more than that.",Erin
"No, no, no, he's nine pounds, seven ounces.",Senator Lipton
"Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?",Angela
"Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-",Oscar
"Well, if it's anything like that gorgeous wrapping paper, you hit it out of the park.",Senator Lipton
"Aw, preemie pajamas!",Angela
"Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-",Oscar
"No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.",Angela
I got Little Kevin Call of Duty.,Kevin
This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.,Oscar
"Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.",Jim
What?,Stanley
Funny? No? Nobody laughing?,Jim
"[laughs] You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.",Dwight
"What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.",Stanley
"Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.",Jim
Your clients. They're all mine.,Dwight
"Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.",Darryl
"Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die.",Andy
"All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. [puts Jim's things in a box] Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. [laughs]",Dwight
"Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim.",Andy
"No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-",Dwight
"I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. [gives Jim a limp slap]",Andy
That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves],Dwight
"[on voicemail] You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao. [beep]",Gabe
"Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.",Dwight
"I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.",Dwight
Shh.,Angela
"Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.",Oscar
"It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio.",Angela
The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.,Oscar
Ah!,Angela
[giggles] Little Kevin.,Kevin
Really?,Angela
Angela.,Oscar
"Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.",Angela
"I knew that, I knew it.",Oscar
"The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.",Angela
Chicken marsala.,Oscar
"Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.",Angela
Mm-hmm.,Oscar
"And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious.",Angela
Dwight. Hey.,Oscar
"Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?",Dwight
"He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.",Oscar
Okay. [sits],Dwight
Don't you want to see the baby?,Oscar
Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.,Dwight
I promised I wouldn't tell.,Oscar
So don't.,Dwight
Angela got pregnant before the wedding.,Oscar
What?,Dwight
She got pregnant before the wedding.,Oscar
How long before?,Dwight
"A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me!",Oscar
Yes I did.,Dwight
Dwight?,Angela
Dwight.,Senator Lipton
I want to see the baby.,Dwight
"Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it.",Erin
"Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves.",Dwight
"That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine.",Dwight
He's hungry.,Angela
"Oh, that's my cue to leave.",Senator Lipton
"No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover.",Angela
Still. Still.,Senator Lipton
You won't see-,Angela
[to Cece] You want a giraffe?,Jim
"Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.",Jim
"Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here.",Pam
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.",Jim
"Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you!",Pam
"Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.",Jim
"Oh, hi Stanley.",Pam
Split the difference?,Jim
Jim.,Pam
"Okay, let's go.",Jim
Hey.,Pam
Hi.,Erin
Hi everybody!,Pam
What?,Jim
Hi.,All
How about a little visit?,Pam
"Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.",Jim
"Hey, Angela's back with her baby.",Creed
"Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.",Pam
"Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does.",Andy
Let me have a turn.,Creed
"No, it's the pacifier's turn.",Pam
All right.,Creed
Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?,Jim
"[gasps] Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.",Pam
Cookies?,Phyllis
"No, but that would've been a really good idea.",Pam
That was a great idea.,Jim
"No, she brought you drawings.",Pam
"Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.",Jim
Oh!,Andy
"Oh, Aunt Phyllis.",Jim
Oh.,Phyllis
"Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?",Andy
No.,Cece
"She says 'no' to everything. You know, she thinks my name is 'No.' Cece, do you want some broccoli?",Pam
Yes.,Cece
No. It's crazy.,Pam
Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?,Ryan
There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.,Andy
"Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?",Kelly
No.,Cece
So then this means nothing to you. [rips picture],Kelly
"Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?",Andy
"You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?",Jim
[cries] Mama!,Cece
Shh.,Pam
I don't know what else we can do here.,Jim
"[cries] Mama, mama, mama.",Cece
It's okay.,Jim
"Oh, it's okay, sweetie.",Pam
"All right, all right. Okay.",Jim
"It's okay, honey. [Philip cries] It's okay, it's okay.",Pam
"All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.",Jim
Shh.,Pam
Mama!,Cece
"Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.",Dwight
Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.,Angela
Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?,Dwight
That is completely untrue.,Angela
Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.,Dwight
You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-,Dwight
I did not. Uh-uh.,Angela
"-and I said, 'I bet I could fulfill you,' and you said, 'I'd like to see you try,' and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.",Dwight
That didn't happen.,Angela
And then I inserted my penis-,Dwight
No! Stop it!,Angela
Into your-,Dwight
Dwight.,Angela
Vagina and-,Dwight
"And even if it did, it's just a coincidence.",Angela
Admit that there is a chance.,Dwight
I will not.,Angela
Admit it. Admit it.,Dwight
"I will not, it's not-",Angela
All done?,Senator Lipton
Yeah.,Dwight
Mmm.,Senator Lipton
"Yes, yes. He's sleeping.",Angela
"Before I go, may I?",Dwight
"Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head.",Angela
"Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.",Dwight
Who are you?,Nurse
I just might be his father.,Dwight
I don't know what that means. We're gonna circumcise him.,Nurse
"[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?",Jim
No!,Cece
"Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?",Jim
"I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier.",Pam
Cece!,Jim
"Okay, we're going.",Pam
"Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.",Jim
"Shh, shh, shh.",Pam
"I know, I know.",Jim
You want to grab her?,Pam
"I'm gonna grab her, okay.",Jim
"Here we go, here we go.",Pam
"Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.",Jim
[groans] We'll see you tomorrow.,Stanley
"No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.",Jim
"No, just go home.",Phyllis
"It's all good, we got this.",Darryl
"I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.",Darryl
Jim.,Pam
Just go.,Phyllis
"Hey, we'll be just fine.",Andy
"Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.",Jim
"Oh, whew!",Andy
"Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here.",Andy
"Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.",Dwight
You had something important to tell me?,Gabe
"Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.",Dwight
"Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?",Dwight
"I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off.",Jim
"Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.",Jim
Mmm-hmm. Moneybags. Must be nice.,Phyllis
So you effectively spent what...four dollars on the entire office?,Andy
"Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...",Jim
You're nothing. When I think about all the gas money I spent on you. Washing my car to make sure you-,Andy
"[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]",Jim
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So you're just gonna throw away perfectly good food?,Darryl
"It's not really food, right?",Jim
I'm really hating this Jim guy!,Creed
"Ok, ok, ok.",Jim
"I know what you can do Jim. Take those black licorice, then go get some of those red licorice, take 'em in your hand, roll 'em up real tight...",Stanley
???And shove it up my butt.???,Jim
"Dammit Jim! You stole my afternoons, now you stole my line! It's not ???shove it up your butt??? it's....I'll kill you! I'll kill you dead!",Stanley
Eat it.,Darryl
I'm not gonna eat it.,Jim
Eat. It.,Darryl
I'm not-,Jim
EAT IT! [Jim begins eating black licorice],Stanley
"[on phone] They hate me, Pam.",Jim
They don't hate you.,Pam
"No, it's bad. Darryl canceled go-karting....",Jim
When were you going go-karting with Darryl?,Pam
It's a lunch thing.,Jim
"Alright. Just don't worry, we'll figure this out.",Pam
I feel like a stranger in my own country.,Jim
"Ok, drama.",Pam
"Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.",Jim
"I have a recurring nightmare that I've been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury. Stanley is fast asleep, Kevin eats the evidence, Phyllis's name is Allison but it really is Phyllis, Jim is foreman of the jury and pronounces me guilty. The cop takes me away and tells me that I've been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall. She leaves the handcuffs on. They take me away to prison. The guards are all women. [sighs]",Dwight
"Everyone, this is Officer Foley from the Scranton PD. Works down at the courthouse. I think he has something he's like to say.",Andy
I understand that some of you don't believe that Mr. Bernard drove his friend into the courthouse for jury duty last week.,Officer Foley
Correction: we don't care.,Darryl
"Hey, aren't you an actor?",Erin
No.,Andy
Weren't you in Sweeny Todd last year with Andy?,Erin
"Uh, no.",Officer Foley
You hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?,Darryl
That is so offensive and ridiculous. I-,Andy
"So if I started singing ???Down By the Old Mill Stream???, you couldn't join me in a three part harmony. [Andy and Officer Foley shake their heads no, Darryl begins singing] Down by the, down by the, down by the....",Darryl
"[singing] Old mill stream. When I first met you, down by the old mill stream [Andy & Foley hold ???stream???]","Andy, Darryl & Officer Foley"
"[Low singing] Old, mill, stream.",Darryl
"Ho hah!....oh, shoot.",Andy
Mm hmm.,Darryl
Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.,Jim
Hey guys!,Pam
Hey.,All
[laughing] Hi.,Pam
Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant. [pretends to punch Pam in the stomach] Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!,Andy
Are you glad to be back?,Phyllis
"Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.",Pam
You still had eight weeks more than we did.,Stanley
"[laughing] Well, it's not exactly a vacation.",Pam
Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!,Angela
What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.,Dwight
I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat],Angela
What?!,Pam
Damn girl! Your body!,Kelly
"Angela, you look amazing.",Oscar
"Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars.",Angela
[murmurs of delight as people shuffle toward the treats],Group
"Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?",Pam
"Extremely, but I'm gonna fight through it.",Kevin
Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.,Pam
"I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.",Angela
When did you find time to do all this?,Pam
"Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?",Angela
Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It's really good.,Pam
"I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.",Angela
"So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So-",Pam
Nope. It's over.,Jim
...we wanted to say thank you-,Pam
Nope. OK.,Jim
"Dwight, I have exciting news for you.",Andy
What?,Dwight
I think you're going to like it.,Andy
You can't tantalize me.,Dwight
"Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...",Andy
OK. [looks at watch and leaves],Dwight
That...[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.,Andy
"If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.",Dwight
"No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.",Andy
"Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!",Dwight
"The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly: Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, ???perfect pork anus??? which I don't mean.",Dwight
And here's the fax for you.,Erin
And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.,Andy
Ah! Love to learn.,Erin
"Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one.",Andy
So... [points out their matching heart pins],Erin
"Uh yeah, look at that.",Andy
We're pin twins.,Erin
"Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.",Andy
"Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too. [Andy laughs, walks away, Erin throws away her pin]",Erin
"For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica.",Erin
What do we have here?,Darryl
"Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a ???we're just friends??? beanie or a ???I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'??? beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.",Darryl
"Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.",Dwight
Really?,Pam
Mm hm.,Dwight
I'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque.,Pam
"Ooh, me three.",Jim
"Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.",Dwight
Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?,Pam
"God, you're such a spy.",Dwight
[clears throat] Notice anything different about me?,Darryl
You're wearing the beanie. You like it?,Val
Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head.,Darryl
"I love it too Val. It's it's really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can't really peg it on the hat.",Nate
[noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here.,Darryl
"I like to knit, don't hate. And who's that for?",Val
"Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here.",Darryl
What?,Nate
Yeah.,Darryl
"Darryl, you shouldn't have.",Nate
Hey.,Darryl
Can I open it?,Nate
"No, no, no. Maybe just later.",Darryl
"Ah, I can't wait. I'm sorry. I get too excited. [opens gift] Darryl.",Nate
Wow. Those are really nice.,Val
They're so elegant.,Nate
Cashmere.,Val
How'd you know?,Nate
Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.,Darryl
Can't wait.,Val
"[reading card] ???I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day.??? Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves.",Nate
"My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?",Dwight
Kathy.,Kathy
Kathy.,Dwight
I just got a text from Robert California that says ???bring your clubs to Florida???.,Jim
Why? Does he think you're going to Florida?,Pam
I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?,Jim
"No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one.",Pam
"You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?",Andy
Yes.,Dwight
Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?,Andy
Oh my god.,Dwight
"They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find.",Andy
Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.,Dwight
"Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.",Andy
Oh god.,Dwight
You have your team.,Andy
Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.,Dwight
"Well, let's hear it.",Pam
"???Robert, Hey!??? Exclamation point.",Jim
I like it so far.,Pam
"???Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA??? Dash JH.",Jim
"It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.",Pam
"Yeah, it's a golf text.",Jim
Total golf text. Send it.,Pam
Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.,Jim
"You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.",Kelly
[on phone] This is Darryl.,Darryl
"Oh, sorry I asked for the main shipping number. I just need the address for the warehouse? I want to send my girlfriend some flowers.",Bob
Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val?,Darryl
"Yeah, do you know her?",Bob
We're friends. We're friends.,Darryl
"Cool. Um, so can I get that address or...?",Bob
"Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen.",Darryl
Why do you need a pen?,Bob
Back off! I got my reasons.,Darryl
"May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?",Dwight
Why?,Kelly
"Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.",Dwight
Hell yeah.,Kelly
What?!,Stanley
"Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.",Dwight
"Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back.",Meredith
It just feels like a slap in the face.,Oscar
"I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.",Dwight
We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.,Oscar
"I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.",Dwight
"Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.",Kevin
"Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.",Dwight
What are the criteria for going?,Ryan
"It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy's office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.",Dwight
Mooshie mooshie. [Dwight laughs],Andy
"Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?",Dwight
Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.,Andy
Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson.,Stanley
Hey!,Kevin
"Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.",Angela
Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.,Kelly
My baby is not a monster!,Angela
Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.,Dwight
"Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!",Andy
Stop calling us ???guys???.,Ryan
I use the word ???guys??? a lot when I'm nervous...guys.,Andy
Guys! Guys! Guys!,Andy
Stop it!,Group
Guys..,Andy
Stop. Stop it Andy.,Ryan
...Andy.,Oscar
Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.,Andy
OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.,Dwight
Wha-,Andy
"If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice.",Stanley
"OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out.",Andy
"Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.",Dwight
No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.,Andy
For you maybe.,Kelly
Five to six hours?,Andy
Three to four hours.,Dwight
No no no no.,Andy
Two to three hours...,Dwight
Nope.,Andy
Come up with a statement in the next hour....,Dwight
Thirty minutes!,Andy
I'm out.,Creed
"Ok, read it back to me.",Pam
"[reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.",Jim
Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact.,Pam
Absolutely. Works for me.,Erin
"Ok, sending.",Jim
Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.,Pam
Really did [Text bleep] He responded L-O-L.,Jim
[laughs exaggeratedly],Erin
I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....,Phyllis
I am...,Meredith
"I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.",Dwight
"You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.",Ryan
Or both?,Andy
"Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.",Ryan
Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.,Andy
"Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.",Dwight
"Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...",Kevin
"Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.",Dwight
Thank you.,Andy
When do we leave?,Kevin
Thank you.,Andy
"It has been a long, lonely winter.",Toby
"Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.",Dwight
"It is real, thank you for saying that.",Toby
"Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?",Andy
Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.,Stanley
Maybe it's what she does here...,Dwight
Well...,Andy
"Hey guys, any spots left?",Erin
"Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?",Andy
I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.,Erin
You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.,Dwight
"Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.",Erin
Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in..,Andy
"Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good.",Erin
"Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?",Jim
I think you need to go to Florida.,Pam
I think you're right.,Jim
"It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be..",Pam
Total nightmare.,Jim
I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?,Pam
"Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.",Jim
Exactly.,Pam
"Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?",Dwight
"Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go.",Andy
I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much.,Dwight
"You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.",Jim
Jim is essential to th-,Dwight
"Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]",Jim
"Andy, Jim is just too...essen-...",Dwight
Essential.,Jim
This is stupid! Cut.,Dwight
"Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks.",Jim
He doesn't even want to go.,Dwight
"Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.",Jim
Oh my god.,Dwight
"Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.",Jim
"OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida: Kathy..",Andy
What?,Dwight
???.Stanley..,Andy
No.,Dwight
...Ryan...,Andy
No!,Dwight
...Erin...,Andy
(Bleep),Dwight
"...And, Jim.",Andy
"You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!",Dwight
"Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move.",Dwight
Why is it so hot in here?,Stanley
"Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.",Dwight
But...,Ryan
"But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?",Dwight
"No no, I want to go.",Ryan
"Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer]",Dwight
Is that the buzzer from Taboo?,Jim
"SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.",Dwight
How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?,Dwight
How did a mosquito get in here?,Stanley
"I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits]",Dwight
"Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says ???I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt??? unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, [Jim slaps Dwight's forehead] oh. What was that?",Dwight
Mosquito.,Jim
[Sighs and grunts] Orientation is over.,Dwight
"Oh Darryl, hey.",Nate
Hey what's up? You called?,Darryl
"Yeah, you know I, I felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and I didn't get you anything...",Nate
It's cool really.,Darryl
"No, it's anything but cool. Now I haven't really had time to go out and buy you anything, but uh, here goes. [Hands Darryl pink slips of paper]",Nate
???This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack???,Darryl
"Yeah, they're Nate coupons. Or Nate-pons. And they're all different. Cash that one in and I will bring you a stick of gum, anytime, any place. I'll find you.",Nate
Thanks. [to Val] Nice flowers.,Darryl
"Thanks, they're from my mom.",Val
Your mom?,Darryl
Yeah.,Val
Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?,Darryl
"Yeah, that's her.",Val
"She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?",Darryl
"[laughs] Yeah Darryl, my mom's name is Brandon.",Val
Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.,Darryl
"Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene.",Dwight
I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.,Erin
So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.,Dwight
"So, what is this special project?",Jim
Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.,Dwight
That sounds awesome.,Jim
"It did, it did.",Dwight
You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.,Ryan
"Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don't write it down unless you like it.",Erin
"Oh, I like it.",Dwight
It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?,Ryan
No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.,Dwight
"Right. Think different, from Apple.",Ryan
"Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?",Jim
[long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?,Dwight
"I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.",Dwight
I don't know how I'm going to live here without you.,Kelly
"Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.",Ryan
"Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.",Kelly
"No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.",Ryan
Alright [kiss],Pam
Bye.,Jim
Bye. Call me when you land.,Pam
I will.,Jim
Safe travels.,Andy
Goodbye for a very very long time.,Erin
"Oh, K. It's only three weeks.",Andy
"[On phone] All expenses paid. Yeah, Jim's gonna be there. Their marriage is not good. Nobody knows better than me. Definitely we will. It's three weeks in Tallahassee, what else is there to do?",Kathy
"Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late.",Dwight
Wake up! [Cathy screams],Dwight
"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! [Erin kicks him] Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?",Dwight
Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.,Erin
"Stanley! Wake up! You???ve got to wake up, the hotel's on fire!",Dwight
"Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day! [Dwight pinches Stanley's nose and covers his mouth]",Erin
Mmm! [struggles] Ugh!,Stanley
[lets go] Good morning.,Dwight
"Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now.",Erin
"Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool!",Ryan
"I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides]",Jim
Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? [sees trashed room] Oh man.,Dwight
What do you think happened?,Erin
"Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees 'IT WAS DWIGHT' written in lipstick on the door] Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. [Jim falls out of the closet, Erin and Dwight scream]",Dwight
Puppet.,Jim
"Cool, for your kids?",Cathy
Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.,Jim
"Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.",Dwight
"I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her.",Dwight
"I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.",Dwight
What does he like?,Saleswoman
Power.,Dwight
"Okay, and this one is, 'Huh. Don't see too many museums around here.'",Ryan
"Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car.",Dwight
"Hey, are you okay?",Erin
"I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.",Dwight
Who says none of us are diarrheal?,Erin
Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.,Jim
"Very funny, Jim.",Dwight
"Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, 'For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?' and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?",Jim
I'm gonna set your face on fire.,Dwight
"That's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?",Jim
"Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod.",Stanley
Yes.,Jim
"You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins.",Stanley
Loggins and Messina.,Jim
Did I say 'Messina?' [tires screech],Stanley
Ahh! [laughs] Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet.,Andy
"I like it. It's so peaceful, I've already written like, twelve plays today.",Creed
"It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin... [drops pin] I thought that would be cooler.",Andy
I loved it.,Darryl
"Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.",Meredith
"Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it.",Andy
Can we see that? Did you really find it?,Oscar
"Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. [chuckles, clicks tongue] In the trash.",Andy
"Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.",Pam
Oh great. [overlapping chatter],Everyone
We're screwed.,Kelly
There. [phone rings],Pam
Oh! There we go! Pam?,Andy
Yeah?,Pam
Can you get the phone?,Andy
Well I'm not the receptionist.,Pam
"Mm, well, you used to be.",Andy
"I know, but I can't cover reception. I have a ton of work to do.",Pam
Phone's ringing.,Andy
Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. [Andy and Pam silently argue] Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!,Kelly
Somebody! Answer the phone.,Everyone
"Andy, pick up the phone!",Kelly
Get the damn phone.,Stanley
You're the closest one to it.,Meredith
"Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. [ringing continues] Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?",Andy
Man.,Jim
How was the drive?,Cathy
Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.,Jim
Life is short. 'Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse.' That's one of my mottoes.,Stanley
I would love to hear the other mottos.,Jim
"Quick query, Halpert.",Packer
No way.,Jim
Still queer?,Packer
Packer.,Dwight
You can't put me down. Too strong!,Packer
"Yeah, Dwight and Jim tried to get me fired, but I landed on my feet down here in Florida. You see, this cat's got nine lives, and a nine-inch-",Packer
"Psst. Say, 'So who's leading this thing, anyway?'",Nellie
"So who's leading this thing, anyway?",Ryan
"Psst. Say, 'I can't wait to meet him.'",Nellie
I can't wait to meet him.,Ryan
"Him, you say? Don't think a woman can be a leader?",Nellie
I-,Ryan
"You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful. Huge, whopping penis? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping penis is right here, [points to her head] and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my penis. [slow clap] I'm Nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch. [points to Jim] After you decided I wasn't 'a good fit-'",Nellie
It was-,Jim
"Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, 'Yes!' So let's talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like?",Nellie
"Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one.",Cathy
"No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic.",Nellie
Well that was just one idea. It doesn't have to be winter.,Cathy
"Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it.",Nellie
Yeah!,Erin
Let me just get the projector working.,Nellie
Uh. [eats antacids],Dwight
You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.,Jim
"You didn't poison me, it's just stress.",Dwight
Okay.,Jim
What is the antidote?,Dwight
True love's kiss.,Jim
"Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man. [points to Ryan] You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon.",Nellie
"I'll do it! I always say, 'You want something done right? Ask Dwight.' Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head. [reaches up, whimpers]",Dwight
I can do it.,Packer
"Mmm! [screams, pulls down screen] There we go.",Dwight
"[on phone] Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use?",Dwight
"Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.",Jim
"Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. [sees chart on screen] Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed.",Dwight
Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks],Nellie
"Sir? Sir, where should we send the ambulance?",Emergency Operator
"Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot.",Dwight
"I tell you what though, since my move down to Florida I've really gotten back into hunting big time.",Packer
Hunting's so primal. Almost sexual.,Nellie
"Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense.",Packer
You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter.,Dwight
Did you say 'masturbator?',Packer
"I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter.",Dwight
Why are you sitting down like that?,Nellie
"Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!",Dwight
Wow. Are you that bored?,Jim
"It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate.",Stanley
Is that another motto?,Jim
It's whatever you want. [offers Jim the bottle],Stanley
Mmm.,Jim
Or do you only drink with your kids?,Stanley
"Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy.",Jim
"I've spent so much of my life telling myself 'Please, don't end up like Stanley,' and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes.",Jim
"We have the Sabre Pyramid, right? Hmm? We've got a bunch of humans. You guys, humans... pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It's a team-building exercise. You'll love it. Who's in? Hmm?",Nellie
"Yup. Tallahassee, let's go.",Packer
"Jim, are you in?",Erin
"Oh, I don't know.",Jim
Sounds like a hoot. I'm in.,Stanley
"All right, what the heck? Let's do it.",Jim
This is great. This is gonna be great.,Packer
I feel like I'm in ancient Egypt.,Nellie
I'll be on top. It's the most important position.,Dwight
"Dude, I think you have appendicitis.",Ryan
[tries to climb human pyramid] Ahh!,Dwight
Dwight?,Ryan
"Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?",Jim
"Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!",Dwight
"Dude, don't you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen.",Packer
[groans] Stop moving!,Dwight
No one's moving!,Jim
Oh! [collapses],Dwight
"Oh, oh! [general commotion]",Everyone
Arrest Jim. He poisoned me.,Dwight
"Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.",Jim
"The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty.",Jim
You need an operation. You have appendicitis.,Paramedic
Oh! Who called it? Nothin' but net.,Ryan
How long will he be gone?,Erin
Two or three days.,Paramedic
Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.,Dwight
"Drama queen, am I right?",Packer
"[to phone] Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. [presses button] Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.",Dwight
That was an interesting diversion. Shall we get back to the meeting?,Packer
"Whoa, are those mini pizzas?",Pam
"Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck.",Andy
"Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? [giggles] Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge.",Kevin
"Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through.",Andy
Oh [bleep] yeah.,Darryl
Up high.,Andy
Yes sir. Thanks.,Darryl
"Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. [whispers to Kelly] I put out some new magazines, check it out.",Andy
"Ah, Dwell.",Creed
"I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. [phone rings] Oh, there's the phone!",Andy
I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in.,Dwight
"Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.",Erin
Who's doing the presentations?,Dwight
"Packer's giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.",Erin
Damn it!,Dwight
"Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-",Erin
"-features a tech support area. Bring in your product, a bunch of nerdy virgins fix it on the spot. Huge for building loyalty.",Packer
Very good point.,Nellie
"Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting.",Dwight
"Dwight, are you all right?",Nellie
I'm great. How are you?,Dwight
What's our presentation about?,Dwight
"Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.",Jim
"I got the surgery, what else is there to do?",Dwight
Do a hundred jumping jacks.,Erin
"No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.",Dwight
I don't feel like it either!,Erin
"[doing jumping jacks] Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-",Erin
I want that vice-presidency.,Dwight
You haven't done any of the research.,Jim
"You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name.' You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it.",Dwight
"Aw, let him do it.",Stanley
"Stanley, are you listening to music?",Jim
Yup.,Stanley
"All right, who's ready for the next presentation?",Dwight
"Ah, what is your topic?",Nellie
"What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.",Dwight
Retail consumer habits.,Erin
"Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.",Dwight
Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?,Dwight
I can field this one.,Ryan
"No, sit down. 'Seasonal.' Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point. [Jim gives Dwight a bowl of ice chips] Thank you. [Dwight sticks his head in the bowl] Oh, God. Next slide.",Dwight
"Mail call! [sings] His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt.",Andy
Are those the lyrics?,Kevin
Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?,Dwight
What are the three pillars of retail?,Nellie
[whispers] Convenience.,Erin
Ingredients.,Dwight
Service.,Erin
Burgers.,Dwight
Building loyalty.,Erin
"Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.",Dwight
"Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight.",Nellie
Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?,Dwight
You are bleeding through your shirt.,Jim
Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. [ties jacket around wound] Ah.,Dwight
"Hey, having fun?",Pam
"Yes I am, as a matter of fact.",Andy
"Well I know how it is. I know it's a lot of fun. I don't know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?",Pam
I found my calling.,Andy
"Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog.",Darryl
"Guys, I don't like this analogy.",Pam
[groans] Ugh! Fine. Did you see this? [points to pens in cup],Andy
It's nice.,Pam
I mean... [Pam giggles],Andy
How are you feeling?,Nellie
"Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.",Dwight
Can I see the wound?,Nellie
[show her the wound] Oh God.,Dwight
Oh! That's disgusting. That's barely healed.,Nellie
"You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass.",Dwight
"A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet.",Nellie
That's right.,Dwight
"That is amazing. Todd, look at that.",Nellie
"Oh, yikes. Incoming- [tries to touch the wound]",Packer
Ah! Not so fast.,Dwight
Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you [points to both] have a lot to offer.,Nellie

Could be a bat weevil??? Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?,Dwight
"Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.",Jim

Come on.,Jim
"If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.",Dwight
You know what? Maybe they just ate.,Jim
"No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.",Dwight
"Okay, they're fine. They're adults.",Jim

Can you??? without running to the other side of the room all night?,Cathy
"Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just??? we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.",Jim

"Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I???m this patrician goddess. But here???s the truth.

"Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It???s gonna be fine. It???s gonna be fine. There???s plenty of Pyramids.",Dwight
Come on. I was in line before you.,Erin
So you???re a blogger right?,Cathy
Yeah. Blogger.,Blogger
"God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I???m trying to be a good girl for once.",Cathy
"Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don???t want to leave yet. I haven???t had so much fun since seeing??? zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.",Erin
How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!,Oscar
No.,Andy
Yes.,Angela
"No, no, no, no, no, we don???t need to call the police. They???ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone???s business, right, Pam?",Andy
Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.,Pam
"And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.",Andy
Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?,Angela
Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.,Andy
1-8-5-0-5.,Pam
"Guys, guys. That???s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.",Darryl
"Look, I don???t feel safe. I think we should call the police.",Phyllis
Yes.,Angela
"Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why??? Toby is giving us self defense training.",Andy
Me?,Toby
Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?,Andy
"Yeah, um... I can???t believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I???ll go put on my cup.",Toby
Great.,Andy
Yes!,Nellie
Okay.,Blogger
I wasn???t really sure which one of you is Chuck.,Nellie
"[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?",Jim
"Look at that guy. He???s got his Sabre phone on, and he???s not even using it.",Blogger
This is a perfect photo for my Daily Fail blog.,Blogger 2
"Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.",Jim
"Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.",Nellie
"Oh, no, no, no. It???s good. It???s really -- on the Internet, it???s a really -- that???s a really good, good, thing.",Dwight
Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?,Dwight
I???m very sorry.,Jim
"We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? ???Hello. Hi sweetie. It???s Jim. I???m calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.???",Nellie
"I???m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?",Jim
"You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! ??Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.",Dwight
"Point it towards the store, idiot!",Dwight
[laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.,Dwight
"Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!",Dwight
We are closed! Come on.,Erin
"Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Let???s try it.",Toby
[smacks Meredith???s head] [screams] [runs out],Creed
Ow.,Meredith
That may have been my fault.,Toby
"What the hell, Toby?",Meredith
"Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you???re not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. ???It???s all about the groin.???",Toby
What if you???re being attacked by a ??? smallish man who happens to not have a groin?,Andy
I don???t think that???s very common.,Toby
What if you???re being attacked by a 4???11??? man who is penisless?,Andy
Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?,Oscar
"Why don???t we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.",Andy
"Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.",Toby
"So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?",Andy
"It???s interesting that you???re drawn to the point of view of the attacker. ??You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel... [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu.",Toby
Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.,Angela
"All right, well, let???s try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn???t everyone stand? Okay, so... you???re being attacked. You???ve got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two.",Toby
"One, two.",Everyone
"[softly] Take that, kid.",Andy
"Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.",Dwight
Patty Grossman. I???m a woman.,Lady Blogger
"But you still work for Wired, right?",Dwight
Yes.,Patty
Good! Okay. Flirt away.,Dwight
Sabre. It???s time to come home.,Ryan
"Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.",Jim
"Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?",Ryan
"Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.",Dwight
You know what?,Ryan
You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.,Dwight
Dwight.,Jim
I???m trying to make him feel important.,Dwight
God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.,Ryan
"Um... [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, you???re so smart. You???re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.",Dwight
You???re so ignorant. You barely know what you???re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.,Ryan
What???s a book? [giggles],Dwight
"On my God. You???re so embarrassing. ??My mom would say the best stuff, though.",Ryan
[ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan.,Jim
And you know that I???m capable of this.,Ryan
"You???re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.",Jim
What did you think of the presentation?,Ryan
"I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --",Jim
Oh! ???Fix??? means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!,Ryan
"Jim, get him a water.",Dwight
"No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!",Ryan
Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!,Dwight
"Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you???re alive.",Toby
"Forgive me for interrupting. I believe my daughter had an altercation with somebody here, some fancy gentleman with a squeaky voice?",Lady
[deep voice] I think you guys might have the wrong Office.,Andy
That???s him... the guy I hit.,Girl
What?,Darryl
You???ve gotta be kidding me.,Oscar
"Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?",Kevin
"No, Kevin -- [sighs]",Oscar
What about the lady you hit with the pine cone?,Lady
There. That chubby one.,Girl
I just had a baby.,Pam
Yesterday?,Girl
Wow.,Pam
Apologize.,Lady
Sorry I kicked your ass in front of your ???thin??? girlfriend.,Girl
How ???bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?,Pam
You know what? Tiffy???s going to college.,Lady
"[deep voice] Listen, I don???t know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I???ll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.",Andy
God bless. Friend of mine uses your paper. You do good work. Bye bye.,Lady
Bye.,Kevin
"So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- ???How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.???",Kelly
There???s no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.,Toby
"No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.",Kelly
"Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.",Darryl
Oh... [Kelly laughing],Andy
Have you seen Erin?,Dwight
I???m on break.,Stanley
Oh God... ??Hey no! Where do you think you???re going? You???ve gotta stay for the big presentation we???ve got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He???s like an even more handsome Bill Gates.,Dwight
When???s the presentation?,Blogger
It???s moments away. Just stay here!,Dwight
"[on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it???s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it???s different because it???s your wife? ??Well, that doesn???t make any sense to me.",Ryan
How you doing?,Nellie
"Don???t talk to me right now. I???m sorry. I- I know you???re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don???t understand is... [voice fades]",Ryan
[to Dwight] Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.,Nellie
"Sorry about kicking you out. It???s just, we don???t want our brand associated with death.",Erin
It???s okay. I???ll go to the Costco and search for handsome men.,Old Lady
You???re not married yet?,Erin
"[laughs] Oh, I was. My husband was my best friend. He passed away.",Old Lady
"My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we???re not really friends.",Erin
Someone rejected you? With that body and those bazongas? Forget him!,Old Lady
Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.,Erin
Well...,Old Lady
How long has he been in the bathroom?,Dwight
About ten minutes.,Jim
Jeez! What???s he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates],Dwight
"Oops, that???s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?",Jim
Are there any bloggers around?,Dwight
It???s Ryan. ???I???m sorry. I lied. I???m not in the bathroom. I can???t do it. I need to see my mom. I???m going home.???,Jim
What is the delay here? Where???s Ryan? Why is he not here?,Nellie
"I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!",Dwight
Uh...,Jim
What?,Nellie
That???s right. Will you just give us a second?,Dwight
You are gonna bloody ruin it. You???re gonna bloody ruin it because you???re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed...,Nellie
okay.,Jim
That???s....,Nellie
Jim --,Dwight
I???m not doing the Presentation.,Jim
"Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I???m telling you... if you don???t do this, [whispers] I don???t stand a chance. Please, Jim.",Dwight
"Okay, I???ll do it.",Jim
"Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan???s costume and check out his notes.",Dwight
A costume?,Jim
"Of course there???s a costume! [laughs] ??Oh, this is gonna be great. There???s nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.",Dwight
Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?,Dwight
I???ve been in here for 20 seconds.,Jim
Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?,Dwight
I???m not wearing eyeliner.,Jim
"You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.",Dwight
"Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that???s --",Jim
It???s true.,Dwight
"This... is the future, because... This is the past. I???ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I???ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I???ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]",Jim
Yep.,Dwight
"When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. ??I just wanted... to go home. ??This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. ??You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.",Jim
ahhhhhh,Crowd
Psst.,Dwight
Oh.,Jim
[image on Pyramid] Sabre... It???s time... to come home.,Ryan
[applause],Crowd
All right. ??Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues],Jim
Yeah. ??Thank you. Thank you.,Jim
"Okay, this isn???t over. Let???s stay focused, okay? ??We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous.",Toby
"Whether it???s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.",Kevin
Okay. Good point...,Toby
Good point? What is a tub of electricity?,Angela
I don???t... I don???t...,Toby
With all due respect we know what we???re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.,Oscar
I was a twelve year old bully.,Kelly
Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.,Angela
Yeah.,Others
"Yeah, that???s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.",Kelly
Thanks.,Angela
Good. Let???s go.,Kelly
I don???t know if this is gonna help...Uh...,Toby
Let???s go Kelly.,Angela
We should stay to maybe some more traditional models...,Toby
You think you???re so pretty! ??Well you???re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!,Kelly
"Okay, this is what???s called pre-violent posturing.",Toby
Take that! ??Not so pre-violent anymore!,Kelly
"Okay, I???m at what???s called ???the decision point.???",Toby
"Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!",Andy
"[laughs] Oh boy. Oh no, I???m not laughing at you. I???m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning.",Pam
"You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby. ??I stepped in and I didn???t care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, ???Where were you when the girls came????",Andy
"Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. ??I just feel good!",Andy
"Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. ??We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.",Dwight
Dwight. ??You???re the vice president.,Nellie
"Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!",Dwight
[squealing],Nellie
Okay! Come on!,Dwight
aagh!,Nellie
Hah! Yah! [kicking and punching the air] Boom!,Dwight
"[exiting office] Everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us.",Andy
[gasps] What?! Why is that?,Everyone
"He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever.",Andy
"So, he's alive.",Angela
Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.,Andy
"Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.",Angela
How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place.,Andy
"If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?",Phyllis
"You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the 'treasure box' and slams it down on Dwight's desk]",Oscar
"When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office 'Don't touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?'] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.",Oscar
I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees],Andy
I am dying to know what's in there.,Oscar
"Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane. [everyone turns to look at Creed]",Andy
"Hi, hello.",Creed
"[to Creed standing in front of the 'treasure box'] Now, carefully... open the box.",Andy
"[opens box, pulls out and displays contents] It's a photo of all of us.",Creed
"Aw, that's so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling]",Pam
"[feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!",Dwight
"[on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball]",Dwight
"Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP.",Nellie
I am loving the chemistry between you two.,Robert California
I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George.,Nellie
I bet. I'm excited.,Robert California
Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo.,Nellie
Ah!,Dwight
I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either.,Nellie
[to Robert] You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh],Dwight
"Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]",Jim
"[sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah!",Dwight
He doesn't even care.,Nellie
Don't even care!,Dwight
"This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.",Jim
"[entering Andy's office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?",Darryl
"Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice.",Andy
I'll put you down for shortbreads.,Darryl
Damn it.,Andy
"[entering Andy's office] Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?",Toby
No. No.,Darryl
What?,Toby
I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.,Darryl
"You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop? [Darryl looks hurt] Or chess club, or?",Toby
"You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.",Darryl
"That's it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl.",Toby
"OK, great.",Darryl
"[exits Andy's office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.",Darryl
"[entering a home carrying groceries] Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo.",Erin
"[rises from chair] Oh, here let me help.",Elderly Woman
"[spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.",Erin
"Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. [Erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.",Erin
"When can I introduce you to my grandson? He's a wonderful swimmer. Shallow end, deep end. He does it all.",Irene
"Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug]",Erin
"[takes mug] Thank you. [takes a sip] Oh, what kind of tea is this?",Irene
"Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.",Erin
"[misses putt] Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We'll just chalk it up to cultural bias.",Nellie
"If I may, [assists Nellie] try holding the putter... yeah, with your wrists here. And your thumbs here.",Robert California
Oh.,Nellie
That's right. Your little finger.,Robert California
[approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies?,Darryl
"Cookies, eh?",Kevin
"[singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.",Kevin
"[Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.",Darryl
I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.,Kevin
"[to Darryl] Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.",Toby
"You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.",Darryl
"No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?",Toby
I do.,Kevin
See?,Toby
"That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?",Darryl
"Oh, I definitely do.",Kevin
"[to Toby] Huh. Hit the road, jack.",Darryl
"No, you hit the road, jack.",Toby
"[looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me.",Kevin
"You know, why don't we split the order? It's only fair.",Toby
"No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.",Kevin
Ugh.,Angela
Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted],Kevin
"Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked.",Nellie
[to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it.,Jim
"Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But...[smiles] bye, bye. I win.",Dwight
"[attempts to shake Dwight's hand] Goodbye, Dwight.",Jim
"[drops golf ball into Jim's open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]",Dwight
"Well, he's Florida's problem now.",Jim
I'll let Dwight have his fun. Today will not be his day.,Robert California
What's that?,Jim
I'm gonna tank the Sabre store at the presentation to the board.,Robert California
I thought you liked the store?,Jim
"Well, the store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers.",Robert California
Thank you.,Jim
"But, there's a reason we sell our products online and over-the-phone. Have you ever used Sabre electronics, Jim? [Jim shakes head] They're cheap. They're unintuitive. The Sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyone's wives do us.",Robert California
"Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.",Jim
"I couldn't just kill the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame though, I did like Dwight.",Robert California
"[from distanced golf cart] Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!",Dwight
"[to Dwight] Bravo, Dwight! Very good! [Jim looks surprised] [to Jim] Shame.",Robert California
"[at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two.",Dwight
How did that look?,Nellie
"I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen.",Gabe
[to Nellie] I told you.,Dwight
"When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. [to Nellie] You'd spin off right. I'd spin off-",Todd Packer
"You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.",Dwight
[enters room] All right. There he is.,Jim
What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?,Dwight
Can I just talk to you for one quick second?,Jim
"What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh]",Dwight
"Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]",Jim
"You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh]",Dwight
"Nice. [To Jim] Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy?",Todd Packer
[to Packer] Silence.,Dwight
"Aw, I'm just trying to-",Todd Packer
"[interrupts] I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation.",Dwight
That's... that's the same guy. It's the joke I made.,Todd Packer
Different guy.,Dwight
"You know, I just think you should know that-",Jim
[interrupts] That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. [others laugh],Dwight
"Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.",Jim
Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.,Erin
Just open the program and type in his user name.,Irene
Can you just do it?,Erin
"[after briefly typing] Here, type in your password.",Irene
Erin123',Erin
"That's a terrible password. And you don't 'make a video chat', you video chat.",Irene
[annoyed] All right.,Erin
"[video chat begins, Andy's head enters the screen from the side] Hello?",Andy
That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it.,Erin
"Oh, now mine's broken. Hang on. [turns his laptop on its side while lying on desk] Oh, there we go.",Andy
"[on phone with Jim] He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him.",Pam
"No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.",Jim
Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.,Pam
I tried. He will not listen.,Jim
Did you actually try your hardest?,Pam
"Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.",Jim
Don't talk to me.,Stanley
Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.,Jim
"If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do.",Pam
OK. All right.,Jim
[to Kevin] What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.,Darryl
[laughs] Yeah.,Phyllis
"That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.",Kevin
Thank you.,Darryl
"I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life.",Toby
"Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?",Darryl
Oh. [looks away],Phyllis
"Baby, if you???re watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.",Darryl
"[to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.",Kelly
Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.,Pam
Make them kiss each other.,Phyllis
Make them kiss me. [everyone 'ew's] [Toby and Darryl look at each other],Meredith
"Yes, this is too tan. This right here-",Erin
No.,Andy
This is a tanned spot.,Erin
"I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you.",Andy
"Well, Andy, I'm not coming back.",Erin
What?,Andy
I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view],Erin
[waves] Hello!,Irene
Andy?,Erin
"Yeah, that's awesome. That's great.",Andy
"[Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.",Kevin
"No, no, no, no. It's not worth it.",Darryl
No.,Toby
"No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.",Kevin
"Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?",Darryl
Hungrier.,Kevin
50?,Toby
Hungrier.,Kevin
You're not talking... triple digits?,Darryl
"Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]",Kevin
[straightens tie in mirror] Showtime.,Dwight
[enters abruptly] Dwight.,Jim
"You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.",Dwight
"OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?",Jim
"Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?",Dwight
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.,Jim
"[rolls eyes] Jim, come on.",Dwight
"Dwight, he's gonna kill the store.",Jim
Uh-huh.,Dwight
"And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.",Jim
Wait. [holds up fingers] He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?,Dwight
Yes.,Jim
[smiles] That's two things.,Dwight
"Dwight, please.",Jim
"Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.",Dwight
"OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-",Jim
You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.,Dwight
"Dwight, come o-",Jim
"Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah![Jim tackles Dwight]",Dwight
[Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help!,Dwight
"Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?",Jim
AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.,Dwight
Gross!,Jim
[attempting to break from Jim's grasp] Ah!,Dwight
"What? What, what, what, what, what?",Jim
"[clutching side] Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-",Dwight
I'm sorry.,Jim
My wound hasn't healed yet.,Dwight
"I'm so sorry, I forgot.",Jim
"Oh, man!",Dwight
You all right? You ok?,Jim
[stops whining and charges Jim] Rrrah!,Dwight
[to Cathy] Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.,Nellie
I don't know. He's not picking up.,Cathy
"Well, looks like Shnoot's a no-show. Guess he wasn't vice presy material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I'm your man.",Todd Packer
"[considers and decides on Packer] Right, let's begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer.",Nellie
Sup?,Todd Packer
[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing?,Phyllis
I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone.,Andy
We knew. Ryan told us.,Oscar
"Ryan, why didn't you tell me?",Andy
Thought you checker my Tumblr?,Ryan
You never update it.,Andy
"Well, I updated it.",Ryan
"Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?",Andy
"We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly]",Pam
"[trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim's legs]",Dwight
What are you doing?,Jim
I was trying to go-,Dwight
Get up.,Jim
"Ok, ok.",Dwight
Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.,Jim
Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.,Dwight
OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.,Jim
[tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans],Dwight
[holding mobile phone up] Go.,Kevin
[in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex.,Darryl
[in feminine voice] And this is Sam.,Toby
[in a feminine voice] Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.,Darryl
Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.,Kevin
"I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.",Darryl
"Yeah, I don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names.",Toby
"Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?",Kevin
"Don't make me be your pony, Kevin.",Toby
"Forget it, man.",Darryl
What do you mean?,Kevin
I'm out. And so is Toby.,Darryl
This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.,Darryl
Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man's horsey.,Toby
"No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]",Kevin
"[tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.",Jim
This. Ends. Now.,Dwight
This is dangerous.,Jim
[picks Jim up] Rrahh! [both fall],Dwight
Why?,Jim
Anything else you need to talk about?,Dwight
Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away],Jim
"[looking disheveled in mirror] Once again, it's show time.",Dwight
"What baffles me is how you could take a perfectly good idea, [Dwight enters] which the great Jo Bennett rightfully signed off on, and then utterly botch it in execution.",Robert California
"If I may speak to that, I have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour, so the man you want is Dwight Shrute.",Todd Packer
I don't see Dwight. He clearly had the infinite wisdom to stay as far away from this clown show as possible.,Robert California
"Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul.",Nellie
That was never on the table.,Robert California
[to Nellie] Are you kidding? [to Robert] She's the queen of the whole freaking Magilla!,Todd Packer
"And yet Todd, it's you who's fired.",Robert California
"What, you, I, I can't get fired. I'm an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh? [Dwight exits meeting room and helps Jim up]",Todd Packer
"[Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They're back. [Everyone greets them]",Darryl
"Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?",Kelly
"Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?",Jim
"Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.",Kelly
[to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back.,Phyllis
[insincerely] Good to be back.,Stanley
"[to Jim] Hey, stranger!",Pam
Hey.,Jim
"Aw, I missed you.",Pam
I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly],Jim
Aw.,Pam
"I'm going to Florida to get Erin. [grabs coat, runs out, then returns] Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so- [looks at computer frustrated] 'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!",Andy
"[telephone ringing] This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we???ll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.",Pam
Nice.,Kevin
"There???s this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it???s not -- it doesn???t sound cool. You just have to see it.",Pam
"Well, I guess it doesn???t look that cool either. But, it???s been up there a long time, so it???s become a pretty big deal.",Pam
Wow. It???s the end of an era.,Jim
"Did a good job, Buddy. Now it???s time to come home.",Pam
I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.,Oscar
"When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.",Kevin
"How long do you think it???s been up there, Kevin?",Ryan
"I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, ???Look, a balloon.???",Kevin
My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.,Dwight
My kid didn???t have a face tattoo.,Meredith
I was still thinking of going back to school.,Darryl
And I was still just a paper salesman.,Jim
"Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. [everyone sighs]",Dwight
Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. [pops loudly] [cheers and applause],All
Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?,Jim
oooh,Kevin
Me.,Darryl
Yeah.,Phyllis
Right here.,Dwight
"Allow me to solve your problem, then.",Nellie
Nellie,Jim
"Mmm. [bites sandwich] Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?",Nellie
What brings you to town?,Jim
"Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here.",Nellie
What?,Dwight
How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.,Dwight
Robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony.,Toby
Mm.,Nellie
What?,Pam
"I- I said I'm Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I'm Toby.",Toby
You messed up saying your name?,Pam
"It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.",Toby
That one looks empty.,Nellie
"No, that's Andy's office.",Jim
"Oh, is it?",Nellie
"I have one simple philosophy in business: if the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.",Nellie
"Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.",Erin
Good morning Erin. [driving by delivering newspapers],Alonzo
How are you? How's your family doing?,Erin
Bye.,Erin
"Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] Listen to me, bragging away.",Erin
Nellie.,Robert
Robert.,Nellie
How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far?,Robert
"So far, so good.",Nellie
Good.,Robert
Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous.,Nellie
"Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn't it?",Robert
Mm-hm.,Nellie
"Now. Let's find you something fun to do here, shall we?",Robert
"Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.",Nellie
We have a manager.,Robert
"Do you really? Because it is 10:00. I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.",Nellie
"Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning?",Robert
"Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?",Kevin
[on phone] Hello.,Andy
"Andy, it's Robert. Why aren't you at work?",Robert
"Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick.",Andy
"I don't care, I don't care. Please come to work immediately.",Robert
"Okay, I'll try to come in even though I'm really sick with the...",Andy
[standing in ocean] ...Florida Flu.,Andy
He just hung up on me mid-sentence.,Robert
"I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right? [picking up dead fish] Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP.",Andy
Not much we can do about this until he gets here.,Robert
Can't you do something about this?,Jim
"Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim.",Robert
-Right.,Jim
What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?,Jim
"Erin, you got a package.",Irene
I'm in the bathroom.,Erin
"Where's the postage? I mean, there's no shipping label.",Glenn
Did you wash your hands?,Irene
Yes.,Erin
[screaming as Andy busts out of box],Erin and Irene
"[singing] Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours!",Andy
"Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.",Erin
"Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you.",Andy
Where's the ring?,Irene
Hm?,Andy
"Where's the ring, Lancelot?",Irene
"Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.",Erin
"Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you.",Erin
[whispering off screen] Why won't she go with him?,Glenn
[whispering] I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause he's not that handsome.,Irene
Hey... don't listen.,Erin
"So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? [in American accent] Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? [normal voice] I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo?",Nellie
"I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.",Jim
"So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. [in American accent] But why, m'lady? [in normal voice] Because I am your new manager.",Nellie
"Robert, is Nellie our new manager?",Pam
[laughs] This is an odd situation. But it's very interesting how it's playing out.,Robert
We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someone's lunch. Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman?,Robert
"I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.",Nellie
Hot tub party?,Kevin
Performance reviews.,Nellie
How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us?,Pam
"On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.",Nellie
"Erin, you really nailed the hot dogs today.",Glenn
"Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better.",Erin
"So, Andrew, how does your skinny brunette girlfriend Jessica feel about you visiting your ex-girlfriend?",Irene
"Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know.",Andy
"So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.",Erin
"I think you should leave, young man.",Irene
"All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you.",Andy
You didn't even stop to pee? Gross.,Erin
Any luck?,Jim
No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.,Pam
"[on phone message, singing] Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-",Andy
"Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there. [Andy's phone vibrating]",Erin
You should take it. It's probably your girlfriend wondering where you are.,Irene
"Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger.",Andy
You really wouldn't feel those kinds of results after one session.,Irene
I don't know. [phone vibrating] Just let it vibrate. It's fine.,Andy
You could put it on silent.,Irene
I don't think it does that.,Andy
"Just go to preferences, then click ???",Irene
[answering Andy's phone] Proctology.,Glenn
[on phone] Andy?,Jim
Jim?,Andy
"Andy, where are you?",Jim
"I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man.",Andy
"He's here in Tallahassee, trying to turn my life upside down.",Irene
"What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.",Jim
"What do you mean, take my job?",Andy
"Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.",Jim
"Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later.",Andy
"Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.",Jim
Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?,Angela
I like working here.,Pam
"Dwight, should she be our manager?",Jim
I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.,Dwight
"Those who can't farm, farm celery.",Dwight
And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat],Jim
"All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.",Nellie
"Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.",Phyllis
"Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.",Nellie
"I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.",Dwight
"Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise.",Nellie
What?,Dwight
"Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?",Nellie
There's no limit to what I think I deserve.,Dwight
Then you accept it?,Nellie
Five percent. No less.,Dwight
Absolutely not. Seven percent.,Nellie
"Six percent, I know my worth.",Dwight
The raise isn't real.,Jim
Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.,Dwight
"So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it.",Nellie
Phyllis.,Pam
Pam.,Phyllis
"So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.",Nellie
Really?,Phyllis
"Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive.",Nellie
Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?,Jim
I am not. Huh.,Robert
"Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.",Jim
"Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown?",Robert
"Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.",Jim
"Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss.",Robert
Yes.,Jim
"Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?",Robert
"Oh, god, nature, please.",Jim
"When two animals are having sex, one of them...",Robert
[exhales sharply],Jim
??? is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua-- this isn't very helpful. You're gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor.,Robert
Was that not the--,Jim
All life is sex. And all sex is competition.,Robert
Mm-hm.,Jim
"And there are no rules to that game. That wasn't so perverted, now was it?",Robert
"Was that it? No, that wasn't bad.",Jim
"My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is?",Robert
No. I would've said no.,Jim
"Mm, let's see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.",Nellie
"Oh, great.",Kelly
"I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.",Jim
"No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.",Dwight
No.,Darryl
Yes.,Dwight
No.,Darryl
Yes.,Dwight
No.,Darryl
Yes.,Dwight
No.,Darryl
Yes.,Dwight
No.,Darryl
"Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.",Dwight
"[Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.",Dwight
[panting] Well fought. I accept the outcome.,Dwight
Touch me and I'll sue.,Creed
I've heard that's amazing when it works.,Erin
"Yeah, if I had my own--",Andy
"Andy, I care about you and I think--",Erin
"--sorry, you go.",Andy
"No, go ahead.",Erin
"Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?",Andy
"Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?",Erin
You broke my heart too.,Andy
"You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.",Erin
I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.,Andy
I know.,Erin
[sighs],Andy
"So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.",Nellie
"Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy.",Pam
"That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two.",Nellie
"Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?",Pam
"Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?",Nellie
"Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle.",Pam
You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap?,Nellie
No.,Pam
"Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.",Nellie
I think... you're a witch.,Pam
"I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: ???I'm amazing.???",Nellie
[drowsily] I'm amazing. [sighs],Pam
"Erin, I think you're making a big mistake right now. Andy is a nice boy.",Irene
Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.,Erin
"I was protecting you because I thought he was no good. But I can tell you really like him. And he's willing to lose his job for you, in this economy with Europe on the brink--",Irene
"Irene, what would you do without me?",Erin
"We're not your concern, sweetheart. Besides, Glenn's going to sue Home Depot.",Irene
Why?,Erin
He got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture.,Irene
"Jim, time for your review.",Nellie
"No, it's not, because you don't really work here.",Jim
"Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?",Nellie
"Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.",Jim
"Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?",Nellie
Yes.,Jim
I'm Tinkerbell.,Nellie
No.,Jim
"Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.",Nellie
And we are grateful.,Stanley
"But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist.",Nellie
She dies.,Jim
She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?,Nellie
Let's see it. Show of hands.,Jim
I do. [applause] Come on everyone...,Kevin
"All right, guys, stop.",Jim
I already spent the money.,Meredith
How?,Jim
"Come on Jim, you're killing her!",Kevin
We believe! We believe!,All
Look at this wonderful recognition of Nellie's leadership. I believe. [applause continues],Robert
"That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it.",Andy
"Andy wait! [running down street] Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I???m sorry.",Erin
Erin!,Andy
Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street],Erin
Let's get out of here.,Erin
Okay.,Andy
Let's go.,Erin
"Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.",Andy
"No, I don't have any stuff.",Erin
Like your toothbrush and stuff.,Andy
I don't have one.,Erin
You don't have a toothbrush?,Andy
No.,Erin
How do you not have a toothbrush?,Andy
I just... there's always one around.,Erin
You just use whichever one is sitting there?,Andy
I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?,Erin
Of course. I own my toothbrush.,Andy
"I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It's just random.",Nellie
Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?,Pam
"Oh, great. [reads] 'Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' Oh that's not good.",Jim
"Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.",Phyllis
It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.,Pam
Stanley doesn't have a moustache.,Jim
Yeah he does.,Pam
"Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.",Oscar
"Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?",Pam
"Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't.",Phyllis
Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!,Pam
"Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?",Jim
Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.,Angela
"Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache]",Pam
"Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.",Dwight
"[bell dings] Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him?",Gabe
"Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]",Jim
Yep.,Dwight
"Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face]",Jim
[reveals Stanley's moustache] Ah! Ha ha ha!,Gabe
He does have a moustache.,Phyllis
Yes!,Dwight
"Welcome back, Stanley. [Stanley grunts]",Pam
"Good morning, Robert,' says no one because our receptionist is in Florida. [no one responds] Pam!",Robert
Oh! [takes out earbuds],Pam
"Is this a video conference you're having with 'Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz'?",Robert
"Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.",Pam
"People, you should come to work already warm. Nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being-",Robert
"Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.",Nellie
"[laughing] Nellie, really, nine fifty?",Robert
"Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.",Nellie
Ah.,Robert
"Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse!",Nellie
[laughs] I've never believed willpower was very important in a woman.,Robert
Ah ha!,Nellie
I don't think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason.,Robert
"Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it.",Nellie
"No, no, no, no. There's something going on. Some stress in your life.",Robert
"Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?",Nellie
[in unison] Yes.,Kevin & Meredith
Ugh! I hate that! No offense.,Nellie
None taken.,Kevin
"Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.",Oscar
"oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!",Nellie
Who's a native?,Stanley
"Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans]",Nellie
What does that mean?,Oscar
"Okay, okay.",Dwight
"If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?",Nellie
Nellie?,Robert
"Yes, Robert!",Nellie
You're clearly under a lot of... stress with the moving and the work situation you've found yourself in.,Robert
Yeah.,Nellie
"Let's help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim. Dwight. Take the day. Help Nellie move those boxes into her new place.",Robert
Why Jim?,Dwight
"The rest of you, let's throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community.",Robert
"I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?",Pam
"I???m sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.",Jim
I'm still not sure why this woman is even here.,Pam
Why is she here?,Jim
[sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life.,Andy
[sings] Going to Pennsylvania.,Erin
"On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania.",Andy
Oh. That must be nice.,Erin
Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.,Andy
"Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.",Erin
Oh. Hmm.,Andy
[sings] Time to have a little kiss!,Andy
No.,Erin
Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.,Andy
Yes.,Erin
I believe in that.,Andy
Yes. So do I.,Erin
"I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important.",Andy
Important.,Erin
Mm-hmm.,Andy
I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.,Phyllis
"I know, right?",Pam
"She's always late, she's always rude...",Oscar
It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.,Phyllis
Yeah.,Oscar
On purpose.,Phyllis
Phyllis!,Pam
[laughs] We should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle],Angela
Order carrot cake. [laughter],Phyllis
"...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.",Andy
"Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.",Erin
Consider it nailed.,Andy
"[vocalizing] I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.",Erin
"Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-",Andy
[whining] What?,Erin
I just need you to know-,Andy
What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh],Erin
[lifting box] Ugh! Ow.,Dwight
"Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.",Jim
"Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? 'Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.'",Dwight
That was one time-,Jim
I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.,Dwight
"Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.",Nellie
"[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.",Jim
"Hey, what's up?",Pam
"Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.",Jim
[shouting] Haulin' cube!,Dwight
That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.,Jim
"So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad.",Pam
Sounds like every other party.,Jim
"No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.",Pam
Oh! Hire a magician.,Jim
What?,Pam
Trust me.,Jim
[laughs] Okay.,Pam
Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird.,Andy
"[knocks on car window] Andy! Hey, what are you doing here?",Lauren
"Hey, Lauren. Look at you.",Andy
"Well, I know. Look at me.",Lauren
"I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica.",Andy
Aww! [clicks tongue],Lauren
"Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.",Andy
Oh. God.,Lauren
"So, I'm Erin. Hi.",Erin
Yep. This is Erin.,Andy
"Nice to meet you. [Erin gasps at another girl outside her window] Well, Jess went out for a run but she'll be back soon. Hey ladies, Andy's here!",Lauren
"Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?",Erin
"Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-",Andy
"Oh, Jess! [claps] Look who stopped by after his business trip!",Lauren
Andy! Hey!,Jessica
I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.,Dwight
"Yes, you should.",Jim
[finds shoe box] Ooh.,Dwight
"[reads] 'Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie.'",Jim
I have to see these shoes.,Dwight
I doubt that they're sh-,Jim
Oh!,Dwight
Whoa. Who is this guy?,Jim
Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.,Dwight
Boyfriend.,Jim
Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.,Dwight
Like a boyfriend?,Jim
You read my mind.,Dwight
Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.,Jim
Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.,Dwight
Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.,Jim
[walks in] Oh.,Nellie
"Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...",Jim
I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry.,Nellie
Why not call...,Dwight
Shh!,Jim
"God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.",Nellie
That's awful. What kind of restaurant.,Dwight
Dwight!,Jim
"I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?",Nellie
I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.,Jim
"If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.",Dwight
"Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this.",Nellie
"No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...",Jim
"God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?",Nellie
"[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.",Jim
"What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.",Pam
"No, that's not what I-",Jim
"Jim, could you give us a hand?",Nellie
"Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.",Jim
"Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone]",Pam
"Pam, we have a great idea.",Angela
Listen to this.,Oscar
We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.,Angela
Or what if...,Pam
Okay.,Angela
"We discuss... [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean.",Pam
"I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.",Angela
We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.,Oscar
What are you talking about? Yes we can.,Pam
What I mean to say is we don't want to.,Oscar
"Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.",Phyllis
"[pops balloon] Suck it! [cheers, applause]",Lauren
Andy-,Erin
It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis?,Andy
"No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.",Erin
These are delicious.,Andy
But... they're penises.,Erin
And we come to Matthew. The guy who was with his old girlfriend basically the whole time we were together. [party guests groan],Lauren
"Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. [laughs] I don't know. I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one.",Andy
"No, pop it. Pop it! [Lauren pops the balloon, party guests cheer]",Party guests
Hey.,Jessica
Hey.,Andy
Sorry. It's kind of a madhouse.,Jessica
[grabs Andy] Ahh!,Megan
"Oh! Ah, Megan.",Andy
"You are one of the good ones, nard dog.",Megan
Aww.,Andy
"No, really. [to Jessica] Where's my Andy?",Megan
I dunno.,Jessica
"Oh, he's out there.",Andy
Aww. Are you going to sing for us?,Megan
"Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so...",Andy
"That's not like you. That's not like you. Come on, sing! Sing!",Megan
[singing] By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...,Andy
"Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie]",Pam
"Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.",Darryl
"Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.",Ryan
Plus everyone would know who you meant.,Oscar
Yeah!,Ryan
"No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?",Pam
Nobody's named Monday.,Angela
"Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.",Ryan
Cause there's someone already here named Pam.,Pam
"Shh, here she comes!",Kevin
Hey!,All
Welcome to your party.,Phyllis
Everybody get comfy now. This first song's over a half hour long. [plays off-tune notes],Creed
"Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, 'Have you heard my originals? They're terrible.' They said, 'Even better.' I said, 'I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie.'",Creed
Maybe we should just go.,Erin
"No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?",Andy
"Uh, yeah, sure. What's up?",Jessica
"Uh, maybe we could talk in private?",Andy
"Uh, yeah. What is it?",Jessica
"Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.",Andy
You're breaking up with me?,Jessica
"Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.",Andy
"Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it?",Jessica
Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.,Andy
What?,Jessica
"I am gay, and I prefer men.",Andy
I knew it!,Kenny
"You did not, Kenny!",Andy
You invited me to go shopping with you.,Kenny
I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay.,Andy
"Andy, you're not gay. I mean, we were... together. And you seemed pretty excitable.",Jessica
"Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.",Andy
I can't say it doesn't make sense...,Jessica
"Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-",Andy
"Look, it's fine, Andy. I didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. I just... I'm just upset for now.",Jessica
"Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. [hugs Jessica, grunts] So... we should probably... go.",Andy
This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent.,Robert
"To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.",Oscar
Cheers.,Robert
Why thank you.,Nellie
"Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.",Oscar
Cheers.,All
"Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died. [laughter]",Angela
"Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.",Jim
We hate Pam. We hate Pam.,Creed
We hate Pam! We hate Pam!,All
So we've established-,Magician
No. No.,Jim
-that you guys hate Pam. Do you ever wish she would just... disappear? [sets off flash paper],Magician
"Oh! [laughter, murmuring]",Pam
That was a really rough scene.,Erin
Right? Rough scene.,Andy
Yeah.,Erin
Oh... at least we can kiss now.,Andy
"Oh, yeah. [gives him a quick kiss]",Erin
"You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time.",Andy
"Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired.",Erin
Yeah.,Andy
Probably from seeing that turkey.,Erin
Oh yeah.,Andy
When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.,Erin
"Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you're my volunteer. Come on over here, huh?",Magician
"Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer.",Jim
"no, Nellie, she-",Robert
I'll do it.,Jim
"Oh! Big guy, huh? How's the air up there? Watch out for... birds. [chuckles] All right, let's uh- let's do some card magic. Now, what I want you to do is... I want you to pick a card just by looking at it. Do not say what it is.",Magician
[picks a card] It's the four of hearts.,Jim
"Oh, no, you-",Robert
"Looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? No hablo el cardo, senor? Hmm? Ha. All right, the card is picked. Now sir, will you please shuffled the deck? [Jim drops the cards] You didn't just do that on purpose, did ya?",Magician
[to Dwight] Why is Jim treating the magician poorly?,Robert
"Little known fact about me. Before I was a magician, I used to work at a rope factory.",Magician
Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.,Jim
But I never could seem to figure out those knots.,Magician
"That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.",Pam
"[yells] What the hell? All right, where's Phyllis? Who's Phyllis? Look. This is really uncool, okay? I put on a clean show here-",Magician
"Okay scram, wizard.",Dwight
What?,Magician
You heard me!,Dwight
Huh!,Magician
"Well Nellie, I'm sorry. If I'd known Jim and Pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician-",Robert
"Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see?",Nellie
"Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party.",Robert
"You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?",Kevin
What? Why are we-,Erin
"I just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door]",Andy
"Oh. Hello. Hey everybody, look who's here.",Megan
What are you doing here?,Jessica
"Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.",Andy
Why the hell did you come back here?,Megan
Go away.,Jessica
Get lost!,Kenny
Get out!,Woman
Okay.,Andy
You're done!,Lauren
Bye guys.,Andy
"Get out! You ruined my party! Who does that? Are you kidding me? [Andy and Erin run to the car] Yeah, run away!",Lauren
You're disgusting!,Kenny
I can't believe you're not gay! [Andy and Erin kiss],Lauren
Yeah get out of here.,Kenny
Don't come back. [someone throws food at the car],Various
"Uh-oh! [laughs, they drive away]",Erin
You don't even know how to drive! Bye Andy! Loser! Nice car!,Various
Hey Hank.,Pam
Yes ma'am.,Hank
I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.,Pam
Yes ma'am. I got my eyes open.,Hank
"Well, turns out he actually made it up there.",Jim
What? That ain't right.,Hank
"Yeah, he came and went.",Pam
"Wait a minute! You said it was a magician, right? [Pam nods] You don't think he could've used... it couldn't have been...",Hank
Let's just- let's go.,Pam
Night-night.,Jim
"Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.",Phyllis
"Phyllis says the same twelve clich??s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.",Jim
So how was the drive in?,Darryl
"Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.",Phyllis
You don't say?,Darryl
Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?,Phyllis
"Oh, the plants are gonna love this.",Phyllis
Yeah.,Oscar
I actually sleep better when it's raining.,Phyllis
Tell me about it.,Meredith
Time's almost up. How many are left?,Oscar
"Just one. 'This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.'",Pam
Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?,Darryl
What do you mean?,Phyllis
"You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?",Pam
"Hey, come on.",Jim
Lots of things are cozy in the rain.,Phyllis
And that's noon. Exactly. [others groan],Jim
"I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today. I'm really happy being here.",Phyllis
[singing] My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-,Andy
"Hey la, hey la...",Andy & Erin
...my girlfriend's back!,Andy
[simultaneously] ...his girlfriend's back! [others cheer and applaud],Erin
"Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi.",Andy
Welcome home.,Kevin
Thank you.,Erin
"Hey, Kev.",Andy
Yeah.,Kevin
Nice sweater.,Andy
[wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.,Kevin
What happened to old salty?,Andy
Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.,Dwight
"I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.",Dwight
Okey dokey. [knocks on door],Andy
Yes?,Nellie
"Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about.",Andy
Oh yes.,Nellie
I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.,Andy
You are most welcome.,Nellie
"Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.",Andy
No.,Nellie
"Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better.",Andy
Mm-hmm.,Nellie
Get back to normalcy.,Andy
"Hmm, no.",Nellie
"...and then just lay him in his crib, and then bicycle his legs. And then after Jim quiets down, you do the same thing with your baby. [Pam, Jim and Kelly laugh] But if he keeps having problems, just give me a call.",Ravi
"Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have.",Pam
That's it.,Jim
"It's no bother, you guys are our friends.",Kelly
"Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.",Pam
"Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.",Jim
Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together.,Pam
[talks over flashbacks] Kelly has been a handful in the past.,Pam
"[cries, slams fist on desk] Why?",Kelly
[Ryan and Kelly make out in the nook] But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. [Ryan and Kelly argue] And I just had to get her clean.,Pam
[Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar's desk] Get lower.,Kevin
"Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.",Ryan
"Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.",Jim
"Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.",Ryan
Don't shake our baby?,Pam
Yeah.,Ryan
"Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.",Pam
"Oh, my God.",Ryan
"Yeah, I'm glad you said something.",Pam
Me too.,Ryan
"Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.",Ryan
"Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?",Ryan
"Yeah, they're really great together.",Pam
"Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?",Ryan
"That's about it, yeah.",Jim
"Nellie! You've been terrific in your interim capacity. But, Andrew is the rightful manager so if you would just give him his office-",Robert
No.,Nellie
I'm sorry?,Robert
This is what I was trying to tell you.,Andy
I'm not accustomed to people saying no to me. [laughs],Robert
"Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.",Nellie
You're both adults. I'm sure you can figure this out between yourselves.,Robert
I never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision. So I find it best to excuse myself temporarily until I've had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally. Buffett operates the same way.,Robert
"I'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars.",Nellie
[chuckling] Okay.,Andy
Five... four...,Nellie
You can't dock my pay-,Andy
Angela! Dock Andy's pay one hundred dollars.,Nellie
On it!,Angela
"Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?",Andy
Do you want to go again?,Nellie
Angela?,Andy
Let's go again. Five... four...,Nellie
"Ooh, she's counting again.",Andy
Three... two... one...,Nellie
"Oh, oh!",Andy
"Angela, two hundred dollars!",Nellie
You got it.,Angela
"Seriously, Angela?",Andy
I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.,Andy
"When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.",Erin
"I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! [Andy laughs] Five... four...",Nellie
You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless.,Andy
Three...,Nellie
It's literally like-,Andy
Two... [Andy runs out of the room] one.,Nellie
"There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.",Erin
Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.,Erin
"Oh, yeah, I was just tired.",Andy
"We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.",Erin
"Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night.",Andy
Really. It's not a big deal.,Erin
Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.,Andy
I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.,Ryan
"Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.",Kelly
"Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.",Ryan
God I don't even remember what that fight was about.,Kelly
"You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.",Ryan
"I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.",Ryan
When you lost the manager job-,Erin
Yes?,Dwight
Did it affect you outside of the office?,Erin
How?,Dwight
I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?,Erin
"Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.",Dwight
"Oh, okay.",Erin
Okay?,Dwight
Okay.,Erin
Washington Monument.,Dwight
Oh.,Erin
Eiffel Tower.,Dwight
"Okay, okay.",Erin
I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.,Pam
"He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, 'Kelly, that will be the color of our children.'",Kelly
"Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?",Pam
Which time?,Kelly
"I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.",Pam
One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.,Dwight
Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.,Dwight
"Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.",Dwight
What do you mean?,Nellie
"Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.",Dwight
"I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood.",Nellie
"Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room.",Nellie
You can't call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.,Andy
"Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.",Nellie
Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So.,Andy
No.,Nellie
Wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.,Andy
"Andrew, not everyone here is important. And the word is 'impotence.'",Robert
"Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy.",Nellie
"Take a man's job, but leave him his balls.' Margaret Thatcher said that... probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie.",Nellie
This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.,Nellie
"It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.",Dwight
"Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?",Oscar
"Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men.",Nellie
[in unison] How old?,Robert & Creed
Jinx. Buy me some Coke.,Creed
Dwight told me about it earlier.,Nellie
Dwight!,Erin
What?,All
You promised!,Erin
Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie?,Kevin
"No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis]",Dwight
What are you doing?,Angela
What is this?,Oscar
"Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it.",Angela
"Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?",Andy
I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.,Andy
Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?,Andy
Um...,Jim
"Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.",Darryl
It seems Andy is the only one with this problem. Fascinating.,Robert
Fascinating.,Andy
"I don't really see what the problem is. Erin doesn't even like sex, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton.",Gabe
"Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo?",Nellie
Tip-top shape.,Kevin
Oh... Stanley?,Nellie
No. Um-um.,Stanley
"Creed, you are a thousand years old.",Nellie
Haven't heard any complaints. Wouldn't care if I did.,Creed
"Okay, so I-",Andy
"Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.",Pam
What happened?,Jim
That a couple of times-,Pam
Couple of times.,Jim
"Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times.",Robert
Yeah Jim.,Dwight
"Yeah Jim, get it out there.",Andy
"Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...",Jim
"Okay, stop.",Pam
I was very drunk.,Jim
"If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.",Phyllis
Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs],Phyllis
I've read- and I don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help.,Gabe
Ugh.,Angela
"This is just, uh- This American Life, I think I heard it on.",Gabe
"No, that's absolutely the case.",Robert
"I know, right?",Gabe
"You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.",Dwight
"Andy, why don't you tell us about the best erection of your life? Or does anyone else have any remarkable erections they'd like to share? [Creed, Kevin and Meredith raise their hands]",Robert
"Ooh, ooh!",Kevin
"Wow, what are we talking about?",Jim
"Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?",Erin
"Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything.",Toby
"The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral.",Nellie
I almost didn't come in today. [laughs],Robert
"[on the phone] Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet.",Andy
"Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional.",Nellie
"Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here! [throws phone] Take 'em yourself!",Erin
"Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses!",Andy
"And Andy is the manager, not Nellie!",Erin
"Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once! [into phone] Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you!",Andy
"Okay, just calm down.",Nellie
You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit.,Andy
"Andy, why don't you just take a seat?",Robert
"Why don't you take a seat, you idiot? [throws chair]",Andy
And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?,Erin
And your stupid face! [grabs Nellie's photo off the wall and smashes it on the ground] And your stupid office! [punches hole in the wall] Ah!,Andy
He does not like that wall.,Darryl
Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.,Erin
That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys.,Andy
"Andy, Erin, you can join us now.",Robert
"Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.",Ryan
All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.,Pam
"Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.",Ryan
"Fair enough. Um... I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you before: I don't like you very much.",Pam
Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.,Ryan
"Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better.",Oscar
For Kelly?,Ryan
"Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package.",Kevin
"I've never met Ravi personally, but I'm gonna go ahead and say, just having knowing you a short while, Brian, that I prefer Ravi. And again, I've never even met the guy.",Nate
"Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.",Ryan
"Oh, no, no, no.",Pam
"Oh, come on.",Oscar
"Read it, please. I love amazing poetry.",Pam
No. It would cause me too much pain.,Ryan
Read through the pain. Be strong.,Pam
This poem would crush you!,Ryan
"Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!",Oscar
"Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.",Kevin
"You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.",Ryan
Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.,Kelly
"Andy, we're going to go with Nellie as manager and put you back on the sales team. I promise you, in time, we'll all laugh about this incident. I already think it's kind of funny. [chuckles]",Robert
No.,Andy
Excuse me?,Robert
I'm saying no.,Andy
Well you can't say no.,Robert
No.,Andy
"[sees Ryan on the horse] Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!",Pam
You are toxic! You are toxic!,Ryan
Boo!,Pam
"Hey, hey. Okay.",Jim
"Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.",Ryan
I wasn't going to interrupt.,Kelly
"Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.",Ryan
"Barf! Ugh, you suck!",Pam
"What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.",Ryan
Turn around. Turn around. Turn around!,Wrangler
Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you.,Ryan
She don't wanna turn around.,Wrangler
"Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.",Ryan
Ryan.,Kelly
Will you roll those dice with me?,Ryan
"You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.",Kelly
No you don't.,Ryan
I do.,Kelly
No you don't.,Ryan
I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?,Kelly
What? [they hug],Ryan
That was really cool. [they make out],Kelly
Ugh. Eww!,Angela
"Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing.",Jim
Oh God!,Angela
"Look, Andrew, we can discuss the specifics of the job.",Robert
No.,Andy
It's the apology. I really have to insist.,Nellie
[British accent] No.,Andy
Stop saying no.,Nellie
No.,Andy
"Andrew, if you say no one more time, you're fired. So... is there anything else you wanna say?",Robert
No.,Andy
"I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive.",Andy
Here- [grabs the box Andy's holding],Erin
"Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it.",Andy
But you hurt your hand.,Erin
I... Got... It.,Andy
Right now?,Erin
Yes.,Andy
You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul?,Pam
"Not at all, can we go?",Jim
"Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches.'",Pam
Second line.,Jim
He is a drifter out to sea.',Pam
"And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.'",Jim
"It's just so dumb. [chokes up] But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...",Pam
"Uh, Ryan can never know.",Jim
"[pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.",Ryan
"Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter?",Pam
Smokey's dead.,Ryan
"Smokey, the bear?",Pam
"Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.",Ryan
"Wow That's terrible, I really liked him.",Jim
Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.,Ryan
"Well, I second that emotion.",Jim
Huh?,Ryan
"I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?",Nellie
"Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, 'Tracks of my Tears'?",Ryan
Yeah,Nellie
"Um... God, so many, Nellie!",Ryan
"No, no, no, 'Tracks of My Tears' and what else? What are some more? What's one more?",Pam
"Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.",Ryan
I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music,Pam
"Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.",Ryan
You don't like the Beatles?,Dwight
That's... That's not the point!,Ryan
Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?,Dwight
"Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?",Ryan
It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.,Oscar
"Okay well, that's a relief!",Ryan
Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!,Jim
"Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go!",Pam
Tickets are 250 bucks.,Jim
250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.,Pam
Yeah... Who's opening?,Ryan
Paul Anka.,Jim
Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.,Ryan
"Okay, you could just show up late though.",Jim
"How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.",Ryan
Tears of a clown!,Pam
"Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!",Ryan
"Looking good, RC!",Darryl
"Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation sex club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick's?",Robert
Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.,Angela
My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!,Angela
"I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed",Dwight
"Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...",Jim
What's going on?,Oscar
There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.,Dwight
Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out,Erin
That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male 'hanging out'. Call the cops!,Dwight
"Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.",Pam
"How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?",Phyllis
"I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.",Dwight
"I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.",Nellie
Hey!,Andy
"Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.",Erin
We think you might kill Robert.,Angela
What?,Andy
because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.,Kevin
"guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser.",Andy
"Oh, great! That sounds good!",Pam
"Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.",Kevin
Why would that be weird?,Andy
"It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.",Kevin
Andy's just coming as my date.,Erin
"Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.",Kevin
[hears knocks on door.] Come in!,Nellie
"You really re-did Andy's office, huh?",Darryl
"Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.",Nellie
"I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.",Darryl
How are things in the warehouse?,Nellie
You could go downstairs and ask them?,Darryl
The warehouse isn't downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it?,Nellie
"Who knew, right?",Darryl
[speechless.] I...,Nellie
Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.,Nellie
"Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.",Angela
"Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?",Andy
"Oh man, this is weird!",Kevin
Andrew. [Robert extends his hand.],Robert
"Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! [hugs Robert and laughs.] I had you, I had you!",Andy
"[points back and forth at the multiple cameras] Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great!",Andy
"Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!",Kevin
"Well, I don't want to get raped [picks up clipboard] Twenty-Two!",Creed
No! It was my idea to not be raped!,Kevin
"[Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!",Dwight
"Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand.",Kevin
"You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!",Dwight
"So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!",Kevin
"What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it.",Andy
"Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.",Jim
The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.,Andy
Sounds like you're doing alright.,Pam
"Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!",Andy
"Oh, this guy is having a breakdown.",Ryan
"You know, Oscar, I really had no idea you were so passionate about animals.",Senator
my dog Gerald is my life.,Oscar
"really? Well, if you want to get involved, call me. This is my cell. I'm more likely to pick up night, say after 9... Excuse me. [Walks away.]",Senator
"This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.",Oscar
[telling story to Nellie.] I stepped in right away and start--,Robert
"Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?",Andy
Well...,Robert
"You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.",Andy
"So, Thomas Oregon is an evil figure?",Robert
Evil! [chuckles.] although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.,Andy
"and the hero, who's that based on?",Robert
"Me, I guess. [sings.] We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!",Andy
Hey jabroni. Show some class.,Meredith
"She's right, Andy. you're being a jabroni",Stanley
You're being a Thomas Oregon!,Andy
"Andrew, I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don't you let me pay for you and Erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight?",Robert
"Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow?",Andy
Andy you should leave. Now.,Robert
"[to Waiter.] Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please.",Andy
"I'm sorry, the tables are sold as complete units.",Waiter
then I'll take a table!,Andy
Okay,Waiter
"And a high five! [Raises hand, misses high five with waiter.] Oh, let's do this again!",Andy
"[waiter is cracking pepper into Andys salad] Oh, yes indeed... When! [Waiter begins walking away.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! [waiter peppers another salad.] When!",Andy
I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!,Oscar
Oh my god!,Pam
I know!,Oscar
"Wait, what? Come on!",Jim
"We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.",Oscar
"Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?",Jim
"Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.",Oscar
"Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]",Jim
Whoa!,Pam
"What happened, did he do it?",Jim
Are you-- Twice! For real?,Pam
"Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.",Jim
Life is Downton Abbey.,Pam
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.,Jim
[on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!,Dwight
It's $475! Like candy from a baby!,Dwight
Hey... David Wallace!,Andy
Andy Bernard!,David
"Hey, how are you?",Andy
"How you doing, I'm great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin?",David
"No, got canned last week.",Andy
"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.",David
"No, best thing that ever happened to me.",Andy
"That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It.",David
Yikes!,Andy
"Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!",David
"Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?",Nellie
Tacos.,Darryl
What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!,Nellie
I can go get us some tacos.,Darryl
Brilliant!,Nellie
If you loan me some money.,Darryl
"Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20?",Nellie
$30.00 ,Darryl
"$30, yes!",Nellie
"I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!",Nellie
"[Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?",Oscar
Boom! [hands Oscar a business card.],Jim
This is interesting.,Oscar
Hm-hmm.,Pam
what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.,Jim
Or you proved that he thinks you're gay.,Pam
He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.,Oscar
"Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!",Pam
"Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!",Jim
"Before we bring out our guest of honor tonight, we are very proud to introduce a great philanthropist and a great guy. Robert California!",Speaker
Thank you. Why do we love dogs? Want me to tell you why? There is no answer. Our love for them confounds reason!,Robert
can you believe this guy?,Andy
"The state senator, Robert Lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if I loved dogs. you know what I said? Yes! [laughter.]",Robert
Not a joke. That was not even a joke.,Andy
"Bella here was a therapy dog for ten years. when her owner passed away she came to this organization for placement. But people don't often adopt older dogs, so Bella and eleven heroes like her are being cared for by our generous volunteers because frankly nobody else will",Robert
I will! I will take all of those dogs!,Andy
"Andy, that's very kind--",Robert
"No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated.",Andy
Andy why don't we discuss this at a--,Robert
"No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference. [Points at himself] This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference [grabs dog] thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!",Andy
Oh God!,Erin
"Mr. Bernard, right this way.",Senator
Okay! Hope you all learned something!,Andy
"Huey is going to need this medication once every 90 minutes. You can administer it orally, but he's going to puke it up. So, other end is best. Don't split up Daisy and Mojo because daisy will start to, uh... I was going to say bark, but it's more of a scream.",Vet
I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already.,Andy
"Uh, no. Kenny's a therapy dog. He apparently thinks you're in some kind of emotional crisis.",Vet
Stupid dog.,Andy
"Well, if you would like to talk about this some more, my office is always open! So here's my office number, and my cell number.",Senator
Thank you!,Meredith
"Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar.",Pam
sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.,Oscar
"No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.",Oscar
"Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!",Darryl
"Oh, great! Okay, oh... Oh, these tacos!",Nellie
Hmhmm.,Darryl
Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph!,Nellie
She's trying.,Darryl

The yearlong membership to Scraton-Bikram Yoga is Dwight Schrute!,Speaker
[applause] Oh yes! Yeah!,Dwight
A one hour appointment with the kissing magician goes to Dwight Schrute!,Speaker
"[applause] Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!",Dwight
"Well, I think I can save us some time, Dwight Schrute has won every single item here!",Speaker
"Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!",Dwight
"Well, Dwight, yes! You certainly are a record breaker! Your donation is the largest we've ever received at over 34 thousand dollars! [applause]",Speaker
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!,Jim
"Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night! [throws microphone and runs away]",Dwight

"Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.",Jim

"Look at that one though, he's smiling!",Jim
"Yeah, he should be! It's his first day without a muzzle.",Vet
This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me,Andy
"Absolutely, it's awesome--",Pam
Yes--,Jim
"I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.",Kevin
"You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--",Andy
"Maybe you would think it too! [silence.] I'm sorry, it's just I don't get to be in a lot of human conversations.",Vet
"Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.",Jim
"Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!",Pam
"Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!",Andy
Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?,Jim
"Yeah, I do. I have that.",Andy
Yeah,Jim
You're going to be alright,Erin
No. No he's not.,Kevin
"Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev!",Andy
You're welcome!,Kevin
Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!,Kevin
So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!,Erin
"Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.",Darryl
"My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.",Kevin
What do you feed her?,Pam
"Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!",Kevin
Is she sick? How are her poops?,Darryl
"Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.",Kevin
Does she smell?,Pam
"She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.",Kevin
"People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!",Kevin
"Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.",Gabe
"Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don???t you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah.",Dwight
I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They???d flex them all night at the discotheque.,Gabe
"Oh, I bet you think it???s all about core, huh?",Dwight
Yeah.,Gabe
"Oh, please.",Dwight
Core???s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One ??? lengthen. Two ??? elongate.,Gabe
"Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who???s the strongest? Well, there???s only one way to solve that ??? flat curl contest.",Jim
"All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.",Jim

"Oh, thank you.",Dwight
You???re welcome.,Jim
Five. Six.,Gabe
"Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,",Jim
"Eight, nine, ten.",All
We got it?,Gabe
Very funny Jim.,Dwight
"Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.",Gabe
"Everyone, conference room, now. [Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over]",Robert
"All right, easy there, grandpa.",Jim
I don???t need your help.,Dwight
Okay. You don???t need my help?,Jim
"Here, here??? Just???",Dwight
Morning.,Andy
Hey.,Erin
Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot??? these.,Andy
Oh.,Erin
You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.,Andy
"Andy, if you???re gonna hang out for a while, uh???",Erin
What???s this?,Andy
"This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.",Erin
Is this Robert???s attempt to embarrass me?,Andy
"No, of course not. It???s just ??? I think it???s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it???s like, where does it end? So just??? [puts visitors tag on Andy]",Erin
"Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they???re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it???s a little much? ???Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that???s what it feels like.",Andy
"All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.",Jim
"Good, we have a deal?",Dwight
Thanks Janet.,Jim
Thanks so much Earl.,Dwight
"Wow, simultaneous sale.",Jim
And they said it couldn???t be done. Boom!,Dwight
Screw ???em.,Jim
Lot going on guys. What???s happening?,Andy
Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.,Jim
"That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It???s like a festival of poo.",Andy
"Hey, hey, come on, language.",Jim
"Yeah, and we???re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.",Dwight
In the fridge.,Jim
"No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.",Dwight
"Sorry, man, I can???t focus on zingers. There???s too many potential clients.",Jim
You two better watch yourselves.,Stanley
"Yeah, the Syracuse branch can???t be happy you???re taking New York clients.",Phyllis
Shh??? shh??? [vomits in trash can],Robert
Robert?,Jim
Why did Binghamton close?,Oscar
"Can everyone just, please??? I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and ??? how should I say this ??? Columbian whites. What ??? what is this about, uh, Binghamton?",Robert
The branch closed. Forever.,Kevin
"Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I???m not gonna start doubting my drunken self now.",Robert
I got your voicemail. From ??? from last night.,Nellie
Wonderful.,Robert
"And the answer??? is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]",Nellie
"Pam, when???s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn???t hold the memories in?",Robert
"Oh, it was this summer ???",Pam
"Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.",Robert
"Um, I am a little busy.",Pam
"Yes, ???course. Why don???t you list the things that would keep you from helping me.",Robert
"Yeah, I can make you a list.",Pam
Let???s do it now. What???s number one?,Robert
Why don???t I help you now?,Pam
There we go.,Robert
Okay.,Pam
Who the hell are Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute?,Harry
"Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?",Erin
And you are???,Dwight
"Harry Jannerone, Dunder Mifflin Syracuse.",Harry
What the hell???s all this?,Harry
"Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.",Andy
"You live well down here in P.A. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which one???s that guy?",Harry
"The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.",Jim
Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to ??? how do I put this ??? steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.,Dwight
"Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.",Jim
Yes.,Dwight
Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch],Jim
[pointing at Toby] There he is. That???s Lloyd.,Dwight
Me?,Toby
"Yeah, you.",Creed
Where do you get off crossing state lines?,Harry
"Now, we???re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.",Toby
I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn???t back down from anybody. And he calls people ???Kimosabe???.,Toby
They???re New York. We???re New York. Sate line is the dividing line. That???s the way it???s always been.,Harry
There???s actually not a rule that says that.,Jim
That???s true.,Dwight
"That???s true. There???s no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?",Toby
No.,Toby
"Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could???ve choked so many people by now.",Dwight
Stay out of my state. It???s in your best interest to stay out of my state.,Harry
I???ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.,Toby
"Just stay out of New York, Lloyd.",Harry
"Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside]",Toby
How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?,Jim
"Robert???s here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I don???t think we were doing that.",Harry
"Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim???s leg.",Dwight
"Where???s the Advil, Jim? I think I???ve hit my limit on the Tylenol ??? Oh.",Robert
"[Doing dishes] Sorry, not Jim.",Andy
"Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida?",Robert
Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.,Andy
"Oh, for god ???",Robert
Robert California. What a surprise you???re here in Scranton.,Harry
Harry???,Robert
So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place?,Harry
How do you mean?,Robert
"I forgot, a??? a pan, uh ???",Andy
"No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead.",Harry
"Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There???s no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems??? so poorly timed.",Robert
"Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.",Dwight
"Listen, Robert, I don???t have time. There???s a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions ???",Harry
Don???t listen to him.,Dwight
Used to be Binghamton???s ???,Harry
Nope.,Dwight
"I want it, it???s mine.",Harry
"Prestige is ours. Okay, they???re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.",Dwight
We need you to make a decision.,Harry
Make a decision.,Dwight
I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said??? [Andy walks out],Robert
"Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. [walking to car] I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.",Andy
"Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there? [camera pans to right, Harry, Dwight, and Jim watching Robert in conference room] They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I???ll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one.",Robert
"Is it just me or is our boss a freakin??? weirdo? [stands up, walks outside] I???m gonna get some air.",Harry
"Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.",Dwight
[Gets up and looks out Nellie???s office window] He???s running!,Jim
Damn it!,Dwight
Damn it.,Jim
Wha ??? what is this supposed to be?,Dwight
It???s a monkey.,Jim
"Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It???s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.",Dwight
"Hold on, hold on. Is this him?",Jim
What?,Dwight
Is that him?,Jim
It???s him! Do something! Get out!,Dwight
What? What am I gonna do? I don???t ???,Jim
"Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That???s it? Oh, that???s great. That???s like a five second delay.",Dwight
Dwight!,Jim
"Come on, let???s go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.",Dwight
Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?,Jim
Yeah.,Dwight
"Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.",Jim
Hit the nos.,Dwight
Are you sure?,Jim
Yes.,Dwight
Brace yourself. 3??? 2???,Jim
Got it. Go.,Dwight
1. Here we go! [turns on wipers],Jim
Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.,Andy
"Oh, do you have an appointment?",Receptionist
"No, I do not.",Andy
"Okay, I think I can squeeze you in.",Receptionist
"Seriously? ???Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.",Andy
He???s really not that busy.,Receptionist
Is there someone here to see me?,Mr. Ramish
"Yes, this man.",Receptionist
Come on in. [Andy walks in],Mr. Ramish
"So???what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?",Pam
"Oh. Oh, I???ll tell you what he does.",Nellie
": [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don???t worry, I won???t lay an egg.",Angela
: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs],Angela
: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.,Angela
Did someone say girl talk?,Gabe
"Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.",Gabe
"Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I???m pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.",Gabe
"Do you think I???d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?",Nellie
"Uh, I think you???re gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. [chuckles] It???ll be upsetting if you don???t.",Gabe
I???m a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.,Andy
Why haven???t I heard of you? You got any references?,Mr. Ramish
No. I???m a rogue.,Andy
Uh-huh.,Mr. Ramish
Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now??? [pulls out business card] I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.,Andy
Every salesman I???ve ever met has given me his personal phone number.,Mr. Ramish
"Of course they have. Which is why I???m giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need ??? anytime, night or day ??? you just stop on by.",Andy
You want me to drive to your house if I need paper.,Mr. Ramish
Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe??? you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.,Andy
"Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together]",Dwight
[Running] Ahhh! [Slides into elevator],Dwight
You all right?,Jim
"Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh.",Dwight
Ah! [Harry walks in],Jim
"[Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?",Jim
"Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!",Dwight
What are you talking about?,Jim
Just run! Take the stairs!,Dwight
I don???t even know where the stairs are!,Jim
I???ll stall him. Go!,Dwight
God!,Jim
[Dwight jumping] What are you doing?,Harry
I???m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We???ll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down.,Dwight
What?,Jim
My pants fell down! I don???t have a belt!,Dwight
"[walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.",Dwight
What???s going on?,Mr. Ramish
Well ???,Dwight
"Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse ???",Harry
I was here first.,Dwight
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.",Mr. Ramish
I already made an appointment??? with your secretary.,Dwight
Let me stop you all right here. I???ve already picked a new paper supplier.,Mr. Ramish
"Wait, it???s not D.M Utica, is it?",Dwight
"No, no, it???s not Dunder Mifflin at all actually. It???s??? Big Red Paper Company.",Mr. Ramish
Big Red Paper Company?,Jim
Mm-hmm.,Mr. Ramish
"Yes, yes, yes!",Andy
Give me a cup of coffee.,Harry
Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?,Dwight
"All right, guys. It didn???t work out for any of us, so??? we???re still on the same team. Let me get these.",Jim
No. Let him get his own. It???s Syracuse money.,Dwight
"You know, your partner???s got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating?",Harry
Jim couldn???t land me in a thousand years.,Dwight
But you???re saying there???s a chance.,Jim
Shut up.,Dwight
[Walks into conference room] Hey.,Pam
Hmm.,Robert
I stole Nellie???s phone.,Pam
Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.,Robert
What do you want from me?,Pam
"Now we get to the bottom of Nellie???s ???yes, yes, yes, yes, never.???",Robert
"Hi, Nell, it???s mom. Do keep your chin up. It can???t be as bad as you described.",Phone
Oh yes it can.,Robert
"This is MasterCard. You are over the limit. Send the minimum payment of $448 by Monday, or we will be forced to send it to collections.",Phone
Shopaholic.,Robert
Sounds like it.,Pam
Yeah.,Robert
"Hi, sis. Is your boss still hitting on you?",Phone
Ah.,Robert
"This is Annie from second nests. I???m sorry, but the Romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother, so, we???re gonna hold out for that.",Phone
"Okay, that???s enough. [grabs phone]",Pam
"Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.",Robert
"No, no, no!",Pam
"No, come on.",Robert
"Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They???re all deleted.",Pam
"Pam, Pam, you???ve completely bungled this!",Robert
Ah. Ahh. [walks out],Pam
Hey.,Pam
"Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?",Nellie
Um??? yes. Definitely. With your hair ???,Pam
Oh!,Nellie

No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.,Pam
"Oh, god, Pam. Don???t get me started.",Nellie
"No, I will not.",Pam
"You???ve just got me started. Robert??? is??? a filthy beast. I mean, don???t you get the feeling, he???s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?",Nellie
Well ???,Pam
"I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.",Nellie
But sometimes he talks about flesh??? and bacchanals.,Pam
I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.,Nellie
No??? don???t. Just put it out of your mind.,Pam
"Pam, what is your address? I???m gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don???t ???",Nellie
"Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.",Nellie
Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And??? I have a new friend. A friend. At work.,Nellie
[Erin opens door] Erin.,Robert
There???s a call for you on line one.,Erin
Who is it?,Robert
He says salvation. No last name.,Erin
"Yeah, hello?",Robert
"[in car] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don???t, and I will find another buyer.",Andy
You???re blackmailing me.,Robert
It???s just business.,Andy
"Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. You???re gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don???t even know my real name. I???m the *bleep* lizard king. [disconnects]",Robert
"Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house]",Andy
[opens door] Andy Bernard.,David
You got a minute?,Andy
Um??? I???m in the middle of a piano lesson.,David
I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.,Andy
Dunder Mifflin. [closes door] Now??? why would I want that? It???s worth half of what it was three years ago.,David
Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.,Andy
"Why don???t you come in? [Andy walks in, closes door]",David
So what would you do if you weren???t selling paper?,Harry
"Oh, man, I???d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.",Jim
What?,Dwight
"Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.",Jim
How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don???t even care about nationals.,Dwight
Nothing?,Harry
"I don???t know. I???ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?",Jim
"I???d like to sell one big thing, you know? Like??? a plane. One sale, I???m out.",Harry
That sounds lovely.,Jim
"Anyway, Robert???s gonna run this company into the ground, so??? We won???t be doing this in six months.",Harry
"[to webcam] Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-",Oscar
What's he doing?,Phyllis
He's searching out younger gays.,Dwight
Oh.,Phyllis
"No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.",Oscar
...with you. [chuckles],Dwight
"No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-",Oscar
Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.,Kelly
Do you not own a mirror?,Oscar
Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.,Kelly
"I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.",Pam
I'm throwing out all my mirrors.,Kelly
"Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-",Oscar
"No, I'm sorry, I just can't sit idly by and have the gay youth of America misled by some reductionist-",Robert
It's not misleading.,Oscar
-pep talk. Sexuality is a spectrum. It's a paradox to think of any sexual activity as 'normal.' It gets better but it also gets vastly more complicated.,Robert
"Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin's nose] Ooh! [whimpers]",Kevin
"Ow! Damn it, Kevin! God!",Robert
"You okay, Robert?",Dwight
Fine.,Robert

"In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.",Oscar
"One, two, three!",Sasha

...their own children.,Dwight
"Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?",Dwight
No thank you.,Angela
"Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.",Dwight
"I know why you're doing this, Dwight.",Jim
"Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.",Jim
"[Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim!",Dwight
Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.,Jim
Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.,Darryl
Bad economy. Bad investment.,Hide
You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?,Darryl
They did not.,Calvin
And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.,Darryl
I wouldn't.,Calvin
"Aw, come on. What's the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?",Darryl
Coconut penis.,Hide
The coconut's pretty subtle.,Darryl
"Come on, man. Can't you just give us a yes or a no?",Calvin
"I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.",Darryl
"If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.",Darryl

Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?,Jim
"Yeah, it is actually.",Andy
"Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.",Andy
[enters with the kids] Family picture!,Pam
Pam? No!,Jim
"What? Honey, we talked about this.",Pam
"No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.",Jim
"Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.",Pam
"No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.",Jim
"No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?",Pam
Nope.,Jim
We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child.,Pam
But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.,Jim
"No, no.",Pam
Nope.,Jim
But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them.,Pam
That's-,Jim
Yes!,Pam
That's-,Jim
And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.,Pam
Okay.,Jim
"Wait, C-R-A-Z...",Kevin
"Great, right up there.",Dwight
Yeah?,Pam
Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.,Jim
Okay.,Pam
Alright. Why don't you just-,Jim
"Oh, great. Thank you.",Pam
-give him to me and... perfect.,Jim
Okay.,Pam
This is great.,Jim
You ready?,Pam
Excuse me.,Jim
There we go.,Pam
Just do it.,Jim
I'll just stand here?,Pam
"Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.",Jim
"Sir, could you look into the camera?",Photographer
"Let's do it, shoot it.",Jim
Sir.,Photographer
Great.,Jim
Up here. [whistles],Dwight
"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.",Jim
"Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good.",Dwight
"Oh, so that's it?",Jim
That's it.,Dwight
See? That wasn't so hard.,Pam
"Cute kids, thanks for coming.",Dwight
"Hello, Erin. Hello, everybody.",Senator Lipton
"Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?",Angela
"Hi, you know, my office got a call that they were shooting family portraits right here. And if there's one thing that every politician instinctively understands, it's a good photo op.",Senator Lipton
[laughs] Yeah.,Phyllis
Heh.,Angela
"Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor]",Erin
Thanks.,Senator Lipton
"Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela.",Dwight
Dwight.,Angela
Nice to see you. May I hold him?,Dwight
Sure.,Senator Lipton
No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.,Angela
"I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.",Angela
[Phillip cries] See the duckie!,Angela
"Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.",Dwight
"Oh, thank you.",Senator Lipton
[slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.,Angela
Really?,Dwight
"This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. [gargles alcohol, chokes, coughs] It's go time.",Andy
"Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.",Andy
"Well, I don't want any soup.",Nellie
But it's really good- [drops soup] Oh!,Andy
"Oh come on, Andy!",Nellie
I know this is going to be a great payoff.,Erin
A delicious moment.,Andy
"But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.",Erin
"Well, but it-",Andy
Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.,Erin
"Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-",Dwight
"Uh-uh, leave us alone.",Angela
I guess we're okay with the fingernails.,Senator Lipton
"Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?",Dwight
"Dwight, we're fine!",Angela
"Oopsie, did somebody make a boopsie?",Senator Lipton
Oh no. [laughs],Angela
I'm just gonna take him out and change him just for a second.,Senator Lipton
"He defecated, aw.",Dwight
You're stinky.,Senator Lipton
"A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?",Darryl
"That's some pretty blatant complementing you're doing there, man. I don't even talk to her like that.",Brandon
"Uh, Brandon?",Val
I would.,Darryl
You would?,Brandon
Yeah.,Darryl
Sounds like you're trying to hit on my girlfriend.,Brandon
"Calm down, he's not.",Val
"Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.",Darryl
[scoffs] So you really think she's gonna leave a guy who owns his own restaurant for a dude who ate his own restaurant?,Brandon
Brandon!,Val
Good slam.,Darryl
"Thank you, Biggie.",Brandon
Good luck to you.,Darryl
"Oh, and have a burger for me.",Brandon
"Okay, shall we take a few more?",Senator Lipton
"I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.",Angela
Okay. There we go.,Senator Lipton
No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!,Angela
Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?,Dwight
"Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.",Toby
"You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably.",Nellie
I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.,Andy
"No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...",Jim
"No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.",Erin
What?,Nellie
You hit her?,Pam
No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.,Andy
"He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-",Erin
"That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest.",Andy
[enters] Happy birthday to Gabe!,Gabe
"Oh, get out, skeleton man!",Nellie
I can refer you to someone to talk to.,Toby
[his phone rings] Huh? Hold on.,Andy
Give you a name or-,Toby
"I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!",Andy
Oh boy.,Jim
"Oh, Andy.",Pam
What?,Oscar
I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.,Andy
David Wallace hasn't worked here in years.,Oscar
"Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum 'Suck It' to the U.S. military.",Andy
"Andy, come on.",Jim
Even I know that's weird.,Kevin
"I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.",Andy
"Hey, Andy, Nobody's calling you crazy, Andy. We're your friends, Andy.",Toby
Stop saying my name.,Andy
"No, he's not making this up.",Erin
"Thank you, Erin.",Andy
Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.,Erin
But have you ever actually seen him yourself?,Pam
Oh my God.,Erin
"Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace.",Andy
Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?,Toby
[into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.,Dwight
"Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there.",Kelly
I do adore you.,Ravi
"Andrew, it's time for you to go home. You're better than this.",Robert
"Yeah, I know.",Andy
"Everyone's better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen. [drinks coconut penis energy drink] Why'd they add coconut? I miss original.",Robert
Hey.,Jim
Hey!,Others
"Hey guys, long time.",David
"David, what are you doing here?",Pam
Is it true you're buying the company?,Phyllis
"Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I've been talking with Andy-",David
What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?,Andy
"I'll get to that in a second, Andy.",David
But it's- it is- it is me? Right?,Andy
"Yes, as we've discussed-",David
What?,Andy
But it's very possible-,David
Oh my God!,Andy
Probable.,David
Wow. From janitor to manager?,Andy
Yep.,David
That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.,Andy
"There's an official announcement, a few details to be-",David
"From total loss to total boss, I mean-",Andy
Can we expect any payroll interruptions?,Stanley
"Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-",David
I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.,Andy
So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?,Phyllis
"Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company.",David
Oof. [laughs] Wouldn't wanna be a Sabre employee right about now. [laughs] I'm actually the CEO.,Robert
"Ah, I didn't realize you were standing there.",David
"Hey, my friend, trust me. This is for the best. I never understood that corporate mess.",Robert
"Well, okay. Great to meet you.",David
"Likewise, I'm Bob. Bob Kazamakis.",Robert
Pleasure.,David
I'd love to give you a little rundown on what I've learned about this place.,Robert
"That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that.",David
Please. [laughs],Robert
Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.,Andy
Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.,Jim
"Gosh, I hope so.",Andy
"No! God, Mose! God!",Angela
"Hi, Angela.",Mose
Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?,Angela
I'm not supposed to say.,Mose
"Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!",Angela
[taking photo with Jada] Let's see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val],Darryl
[stands next to him] Right here?,Val
Cool.,Darryl
Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.,Andy
May I say one thing?,Nellie
It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.,Andy
The quality of mercy is not strained.,Nellie
No.,Andy
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.,Nellie
Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?,Andy
It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.,Nellie
I just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?,Andy
If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?,Andy
"Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.",Nellie
"All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?",Andy
"Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him.",David
Ouch. That's gotta hurt!,Meredith
"But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important.",David
"David has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. So, for the next three years, I'll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women.",Robert
I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me.,David
"Oprah Winfrey's leadership academy and other schools like it, while wonderful, end with high school. I want to see these girls right through college, especially the gymnasts. They've lost so many years of crucial education to perfecting their bodies. Muscle groups the rest of us can't even fathom.",Robert
Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?,Andy
"Yeah, so I'm hoping to identify some truly exceptional women who show great promise. Well, Andy, it's been fun.",Robert
"Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips]",Andy
It's been a great year.,Robert
Hello.,Dwight
Where is it?,Angela
They're testing it now.,Dwight
How long does it take to get the results?,Angela
Seventy-two hours.,Dwight
You're gonna wait here?,Angela
Yes. [Angela sits and holds his hand],Dwight
"[Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!",Angela
Hey.,Senator Lipton
"Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you?",Oscar
You didn't call.,Senator Lipton
"Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...",Oscar
You know what this is about. [covers Phillip's eyes] Call.,Senator Lipton
"Andy???s coming back today! Andy???s coming back today! Ha! Andy???s coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.",Erin
"How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that???s really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.",Dwight
"Mr. Schrute, the results are in. You are not the father.",Doctor
I told you [Dwight vomits power drink on Angela],Angela
"Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I???m not that good at puzzles.",Kevin
[as Kevin reassembles shell] That piece doesn???t go there. [Kevin shushes him],Oscar
"So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn???t get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.",Kevin
"For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.",Pam
You are really good at modesty. She???s a genius. She painted this incredible mural in the kids??? room. There???s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children???,Jim
"Kay, well, you had that interesting thing.",Pam
"Oh, yeah",Jim
"Yes, Jim???s friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.",Pam
Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.,Jim
And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.,Pam
"In Philly, so, that doesn???t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.",Jim
He said if it takes off he???s gonna buy us a new car.,Pam
An Altima or better.,Jim
Kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fianc?? Ravi was hired as a pediatrics professor at Miami university.,Toby
[tossing out winter coats] I don???t need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.,Kelly
"Miami University in Ohio. On her last day, Kelly was still a little confused about it",Toby
Enjoy the snow losers.,Kelly
I???m so happy for you Kelly.,Erin
"Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons.",Toby
"I???ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It???s a big university town. And, uh, that???s not garbage, it???s out clothes.",Ryan
And that was our summer.,Pam
we good?,Jim
Yeah,Off-camera
"Don???t you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.",Pam
"Well we???re more following you guys, to see how you turn out.",Off-camera
"Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don???t think anything???s gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there???s just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.",Pam
Andy???s coming back today!,Erin
"Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out?",Clark
"Oh, my god. It???s called a garbage can.",Stanley
Helpless.,Phyllis
There???s two new guys back there with me now. They???re in their 20s. And we really get along.,Toby
[Playing computer game with Toby] You???re looking good.,Clark
Just three single guys. Getting into trouble.,Toby
They???re like the new Jim and Dwight.,Stanley
"Oh, yes, yes I see that! Perfect.",Nellie
"Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face.",Meredith
No thank you. My name???s Pete.,Pete
"No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith???s face. And if that makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.",Jim
"Andy???s here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy???s here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy???s here. Pam, he???s here. [squeals as Andy walks in]",Erin
"Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it???ll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!",Andy
"It sounds amazing, tell us all about it.",Nellie
What???re you still doing here?,Andy
"Wonderful, thanks.",Nellie
You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.,Andy
Brilliant.,Nellie
"See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It???s Clark and, um???",Andy
Pete!,Pete
In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.,Andy
What? Why?,Pete
Cause you???re always taking dumps.,Andy
No I???m not.,Pete
"Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.",Andy
I love it.,Clark
"Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.",Darryl
"No, I prefer Fart.",Clark
"No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.",Andy
I don???t see it.,Dwight
I don???t either.,Clark
"Whoa! Mind blown. It???s like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?",Andy
"Yes, yes I am. [puts his arm around Clark]",Dwight
"Dwight, Jr! [Dwight gives Clark a noogie]",Andy
In a way it???s like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they???ll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I???ll have a grandson.,Dwight
"Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.",Angela
"The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?",Kevin
"Angela???s cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can???t eat cats. You can???t eat cats, Kevin.",Kevin
"No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look [starts playing video on computer]. He???s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants",Angela
I???ll take him.,Kevin
"Please, after the turtle?",Angela
I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!,Kevin
"Oscar, Oscar, will you take him?",Angela
"No, I???m a dog person.",Oscar
"If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.",Angela
"Those guys always change back, Angela.",Oscar
"David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.",Andy
Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive.,David
Hey you wanted to see me?,Toby
"Yeah, I gotta go David. [hangs up phone] Why is Nellie still here?",Andy
You can only fire Nellie for cause.,Toby
"Mm, then I will make up a cause.",Andy
"Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now if she sues, I have to testify against you.",Toby
Then forget I just told you that.,Andy
Can???t. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. I sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean?,Toby
Now I know why Michael hated you so much.,Andy
"Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!",Dwight
"Yep, body by Cheez-it",Clark
"Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?",Dwight
I think I???m busy that night. Or I would.,Clark
"Well, we???re both just kinda learning as we go, aren???t we?",Dwight
Learning what?,Clark
"Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.",Dwight
Kay.,Clark
"So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?",Dwight
"Is this???is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that???s totally fine. Like, I???m fine with it. But you should know that I???m into the ladies.",Clark
Spoken like a true root man.,Dwight
"You know, if you???re ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you.",Clark
My calls?,Dwight
So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven???t had time to pursue yet?,Clark
You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?,Dwight
"Yeah, I???ll just give it a glance???",Clark
Ok,Dwight
I???ll give it a read.,Clark
With my leads and stuff like that?,Dwight
Yeah.,Clark
Cause you???re interested in going into sales?,Dwight
I am.,Clark
"Wow, that???s great. That???s great. Ok, good, let???s talk about that, ok?",Dwight
Ok.,Clark
You???re not getting my clients! Nice try.,Dwight
"Paranoid? I???m not familiar with the word. And I really don???t have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.",Dwight
"Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.",Dwight
Done. Explain.,Jim
The new guys. Dwight Jr is after my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.,Dwight
"Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.",Jim
"Wait, sales???what sales meeting?",Dwight
The new guys called one.,Jim
The new guys called a sales meeting?,Dwight
Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?,Jim
There???s no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?,Dwight
You should ask him. It???s a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.,Jim
Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn???t given me a definite yes or no.,Angela
Definitely no.,Oscar
"Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I???m fine with either, but not both. [to Pam] Listen, you???re in this, but you need to wow me, ok?",Angela
I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It???s going to be terrible.,Andy
Not necessarily,Nellie
"No I???m going to make sure that it is. And if it isn???t, I???m going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don???t like to throw around the b-word, but I???m going to be a huge bitch to you.",Andy
Now this is called slack lining.,Andy
"I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.",Andy
"If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you???ll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.",Andy
Iceman.,Rafe
"That???s me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete???s foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.",Andy
You a sports fan?,Jim
"Sure, boxing, tennis.",Pete
Oh. Any team sports?,Jim
NASCAR. The Amazing Race.,Pete
"Phillies fan, though, right?",Jim
You mean horses?,Pete
"No, like baseball. A baseball team.",Jim
"Ah, I like the Red Sox. I???m from Vermont.",Pete
Ok. Good talk.,Jim
I have nothing in common with Plop.,Jim
"All right, who???s next? Nellie?",Andy
"Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends.",Nellie
Nonsense. Get up here.,Andy
Go ahead,Kevin
"Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?",Andy
I???m very self-conscious about my feet.,Nellie
"Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa! [pushes Nellie off slack line] You suck. Alright, who???s next? Darryl?",Andy
This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.,Darryl
Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed.,Andy
"Uh, I guess I could give it shot.",Clark
"Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.",Andy
Ok,Clark
Focus on the horizon. [Clark successfully walks the slack line] Whoa! Look at this guy.,Andy
I???ve always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears.,Clark
"Go, Dwight Jr!",Darryl
"Hey, yes.",Andy
"Boo, unimpressed. It???s a tightrope for babies. Boo!",Dwight
"Alright, let???s see you do it.",Clark
Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.,Andy
Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?,Andy
"Ok, I am just getting started, ok?",Dwight
"You got this, it???s all you. [as Dwight repeatedly fails and gets smacked around] Got ourselves a yard sale. Balls in face. It???s not a race, Dwight.",Clark
Well it???s official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.,Andy
[bleeding heavily from the mouth] That???s not true. Just give me another chance.,Dwight
But your mouth is ble???,Oscar
"This is a bloodbath. Alright, I???m calling this.",Toby
What?,Dwight
"It is enough of this. Everyone, let???s go back to work.",Toby
This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots.,Dwight
"Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn???t seem so macho now, does it? It???s a jump rope!",Dwight
Dwight!,Pam
"Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.",Dwight
[sees trapeze contraption] What are you doing?,Pam
"Come here, I???ll show you.",Dwight
Why do you want this cat?,Angela
"I don???t want it, really.",Pete
How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?,Angela
"I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night.",Pete
Have you taken any concrete steps?,Angela
"Well, I???m still just fitting in here, you know? Getting used to the new job. But, definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list.",Pete
"Oh, come on, Pete! God, that???s just sad. If he doesn???t watch himself, he???s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.",Jim
Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it???s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.,Dwight
I will?,Pam
"You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn???t you say?",Dwight
"Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.",Pam
So you???ll do it?,Dwight
No.,Pam
"Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.",Dwight
"Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.",Pam
Come on.,Dwight
Exactly the way it is.,Pam
"No, Pam.",Dwight
"Yes, and there???s nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.",Pam
"Please? Please, Pam?",Dwight
"Find someone else, I don???t know. Ask Phyllis.",Pam
"I can???t use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I???ll be launched into space. God, you???re so insensitive.",Dwight
Why are you getting rid of it?,Pete
Allergies.,Angela
Your husband?,Pete
"No, the baby. Please, it???s my husband???s favorite cat. He???s broken up about it. It???s the only time I???ve seen him cry other than our wedding night.",Angela
You know what? I will take Comstock.,Oscar
"Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you!",Angela
I???ll come by after work and pick him up.,Oscar
"Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won???t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight",Angela
C???est la vie.,Oscar
Please don???t teach the cat French.,Angela
"[on phone] Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.",Oscar
You ready?,Pam
Yeah. You know what? I???ll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.,Jim
Kay.,Pam
"Ok. [prepares bike trapeze]Oh, god.",Dwight
"Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I???m about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!",Dwight
"Hey, man. It???s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don???t. I???m in. Yeah, yep, I???m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!",Jim
"Woo! [starts pedaling out until trapeze bike flips over, he dangles from the handlebars] Ahh!!",Dwight
"In the parking lot today there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company.",Creed
"Crap. Sorry, Nellie.",Meredith
"Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would???[hit in the face with trash]",Nellie
"Mm, swish.",Stanley
"Oh, it???s nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are.",Nellie
There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.,Andy
[As trash is thrown at her] Fluke.,Nellie
"[surveying an untidy office] The building???s custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we???re living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.",Pam
"[viewing the chore wheel for the first time] Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?",Kevin
"Well, it doesn???t spin. We???ll just move the wheel one notch each morning and??? you see what chore you get that day.",Pam
A wheel is supposed to spin.,Kevin
"Yeah, you know, like [motions arm in circles] guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh??? guh.",Erin
"No, I???m familiar with spinning. It???s just that wouldn???t work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-",Pam
"[interrupting] Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores.",Andy
"A wheel wants to spin, Pam.",Creed
[reluctantly] Spinning would be more fun.,Jim
[frustrated] ???Kay.,Pam
"[spinning a new ???chore wheel??? while everyone claps] Okay, that???s what I???m talking about! Big money, big money! [wheel stops on ???mug duty???, disappointed] Mug duty?",Kevin
"Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.",Pam
This sucks.,Kevin
"Yeah, seriously, it???s like everything on there is work.",Erin
I don???t think you guys understand why we???re doing this. It???s-,Pam
"Yeah, I don???t think that you understand wheels.",Kevin
"I???ve been through several rounds of development with the team and here???s where we stand with the chore wheel. [introducing a third ???chore wheel???, excited] We???ve got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; it???s more fun this way.",Pam
[everyone cheers as Meredith spins and lands on ???tiny wheel???] The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It???s so cute no one seems to mind.,Pam
[referencing the ???tiny wheel???] Toilets! [everyone cheers as Meredith accepts her chore],Pam
"[at the Halpert residence as Cece twirls in the front yard, exiting front door] Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma???s got breakfast, OK? [to camera] We are going to Roy???s wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife???s ex-fianc?????s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it???s your wife???s ex-fianc??.",Jim
"[exiting house] Thanks, mom!",Pam
[to Pam] A banana?,Jim
Yeah. I???m afraid he???s only gonna have hot dogs.,Pam
"Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.",Jim
Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.,Pam
[to camera] Just??? so weird.,Jim
"[as Pete and Clark enter office] Oh, Pete, you???ve got mail.",Erin
Really? I got something?,Pete
"Well, it???s addressed to Customer Service so, it???s your mail.",Erin
"Well, you know, I???m also Customer Service.",Clark
"Yeah, I???m alternating. [gestures both men]",Erin
"[sarcastically] Yay, another person yelling at me.",Pete
"Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.",Erin
That???s really nice.,Pete
"[looking down at Erin???s desk] Wow, Newsweek, huh? This election??? thing is crazy, right?",Clark
[referring to the letter] It???s open.,Pete
"Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It???s not a nice letter.",Erin
[whispering] OK.,Pete
[distributing paperwork to the office] Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived.,Nellie
I know you don???t really exist.,Creed
"Today, I launch my big charity initiative ???Operation Give Back???. Andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, I???d like to see him piss on that one.",Nellie
[at Roy???s wedding] Darryl! Ha-ha! What???s happening?,Roy
"Congratulations, baby!",Darryl
"Ah, thank you!",Roy
[Jim and Pam approaching the wedding venue] Is this his house?,Jim
Think so.,Pam
[approaching Jim and Pam] Mimosa?,Server
[taking glass] Thank you.,Pam
Would you like me to take your peel?,Server
"[embarrassed] Yes, thank you. [finishes banana and hands server the peel]",Pam
OK.,Jim
[as Jim receives and declines a call] Who???s that?,Pam
"Uh, my ex-fianc??.",Jim
[sarcastically] Ha-ha.,Pam
"I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn???t know. Um??? actually I did tell Pam and we decided ???no???. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I???m thinking there???s another conversation coming. And, it???s hard to know when that will be.",Jim
"With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports.",Nellie
[grinning] Oh boy! What's happening?,Kevin
"There's four thousand dollars to give away. So, who has filled out their form? Stanley?",Nellie
American Diabetes Association.,Stanley
"Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. [to Nellie] I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?",Angela
"I w-, uh, I would love to give uh-",Toby
"[excited] Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank.",Kevin
"I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and help build gnomes.",Creed
"Dwight, what about you?",Nellie
I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.,Dwight
"Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives.",Andy
"Thank you, Andy.",Nellie
I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.,Andy
"Dwight, you will be participating.",Nellie
No thank you.,Dwight
"Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like.",Nellie
"Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation.",Dwight
"Great, thank you.",Nellie
Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.,Dwight
"[everyone groans] Oh, for goodness' sake, Dwight.",Nellie
Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.,Dwight
"The Taliban is the worst. Great heroine, though.",Creed
"Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back.",Nellie
"Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome. [wads up Nellie's charity sheet and tosses it toward her]",Dwight
"[approaches Roy back at the wedding] There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?",Jim
"Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice.",Roy
"Thanks for inviting us, by the way-",Jim
Are you kidding?,Roy
"That was, that was a surprise.",Jim
"Come on. If it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a bullet on that one. [sees Jim's reaction] Just kidding.",Roy
You're welcome.,Jim
Thanks...aw.,Roy
"By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.",Jim
"Started a gravel company. I mean, who knew it'd take off?",Roy
Gravel company?,Jim
Yeah. What about you? What are you doing?,Roy
"Not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-",Jim
"Oh, cool.",Roy
"Yeah, you never know.",Jim
"Hey bro, stop wasting time with this haircut. [referring to Jim] He's got a fifty-thousand dollar sports car. Cheers.",Kenny
"OK, Kenny.",Jim
"[talking on phone] Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out but where am I gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed? Huh? Hold on, hold on. [covers phone's receiver] Erin, do you know anybody that might want... [has realization] Oh my gosh. You love the news, right?",Clark
"Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad.",Erin
"Well, I got a buddy that's a big time local news producer and I can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind.",Clark
"Uh, is it Duncan?",Pete
He's looking for on-air talent and he'd kill me if I didn't get you on tape.,Clark
"You mean, put me on the news?",Erin
"You'll just come over, put on little lipstick, loosen up with a glass of red wine and then we'll just run through a few stories. You know, a couple different ways, with a couple different outfits. It'd be really tasteful and it'd really help me out with Duncan... with my friend. [Erin considers] What do you say? Huh?",Clark
"Maybe, ok? Let me think about it.",Erin
[Pete looks on disappointed] Ok.,Clark
Whoo!,Erin
Think it over. [punches Pete],Clark
"No, Clark's not my friend. He is the douche that sits next to me at the office. My friends are Scott, Glenn, and Rob. But, you don't know them.",Pete
"I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?",Erin
"So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you. [approaches piano]",Roy
He plays piano?,Jim
No. Roy? No.,Pam
"You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it. [sits in front of piano]",Roy
"[clapping] You got this, Roy. [Roy begins playing and singing She's Got a Way by Billy Joel, Pam and Jim looked shocked, Phyllis and Bob begin making out]",Darryl
[in the car] We still surprise each other.,Pam
Definitely.,Jim
"You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-",Pam
Courtside seats. Sixers.,Jim
"Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was-",Pam
It was an away game.,Jim
"In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. [long pause] Do we know everything about each other?",Pam
No.,Jim
Tell me one thing about you I don't know.,Pam
"[laughs] Um, ok. [thinks but says nothing]",Jim
"[in the kitchen] Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-",Jim
And you thought you guys were millionaires.,Pam
You heard that one.,Jim
"Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember.",Pam
That I thought we were millionaires.,Jim
"Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. Shoot, I knew that one.",Pam
That's all right.,Jim
The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. [Oscar chokes on his coffee],Angela
You all right? [Oscar nods],Jim
You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here.,Nellie
Anything else would be inconsistent.,Dwight
Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office? [offers Dwight a contract],Nellie
"[takes contract] Absolutely, I will.",Dwight
I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. [in a fake English accent] You don't have a plan.,Dwight
"When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan.",Nellie
[holds up pen as Dwight searches his desk] Looking for this?,Nellie
What the? [follows Nellie into the break room],Dwight
"Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it.",Nellie
[taking pen back] Gimme that.,Dwight
"Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off.",Nellie
You're insane.,Dwight
"I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity.",Nellie
"Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.",Dwight
"In that case, you... [pulls out a cleaver] will have to chop off my hand.",Nellie
"[considers then takes cleaver] This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most.",Dwight
"I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands.",Nellie
Sounds like a plan.,Dwight
[in his office] Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment?,Andy
Yeah.,Erin
"[entering annex] Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does Erin need for this news audition?",Andy
"Uh... couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe, no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. Uh, something low-cut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut.",Clark
Really?,Andy
"Yeah, industry secret. You're gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back.",Clark
Seems unnecessary for an audition.,Pete
"And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but I probably got one she can borrow at my place, so-",Clark
"Thank god someone here knows what their talking about. I want you to take this credit card, take Erin to the mall and get that stuff.",Andy
I absolutely will do that.,Clark
Awesome. [to Pete] Plop!,Andy
"Pff. Guess I'll just head over to the mall then. Buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits.",Clark
"That Clark, huh? Errr [punches palm] Ca!",Pete
[in kitchen with several people around] Next question for our oldie-weds-,Oscar
What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?,Kevin
[to Kevin] Language.,Angela
Who was Pam's first celebrity crush?,Phyllis
Pam's first celebrity crush.,Oscar
[whispering] John Stamos.,Toby
Ready?,Jim
Uh-huh.,Pam
[as he and Pam flip their cards] John Stamos.,Jim
Oh!,Angela
Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-,Pam
Johnny Depp.,Toby
Johnny Depp. [everyone looks confused toward Toby],Pam
"[after awkward pause] Sh, uh, um, I was having this separate conversation with Kevin. Uh, Johnny Depp.",Toby
Totally. George Clooney.,Kevin
Uh-huh.,Toby
"OK, I have one. I have one. [Jim's phone rings and he motions he's taking the call elsewhere]",Angela
[while Angela tries asking a question] What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?,Kevin
"[as Pam wonders about Jim] Kevin, stop it with that question.",Angela
"[in the stairwell on his phone] Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!",Jim
It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real.,Jim
I think maybe there actually is something I don't know about Jim.,Pam
"Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence.",Darryl
Her body. We're gonna talk about her body. [to Darryl] Good. Great job.,Andy
Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black.,Darryl
[to a full conference room] Erin has an audition to be a newscaster. [general acknowledgement],Andy
"Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl.",Andy
"OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color.",Darryl
"Yeah, right?",Andy
I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?,Jim
Yeah.,Andy
Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?,Oscar
News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy.,Andy
"I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite.",Oscar
"Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride.",Meredith
"Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or...",Oscar
Has she done the pageant circuit?,Angela
"No, I watch the news.",Erin
She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen.,Andy
"This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.",Erin
[whispering to Pete] Whatever it takes.,Clark
"[whispering] Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard.",Pete
[places Nellie's hand on a board and holds up cleaver] This is it. Any questions?,Dwight
Is it gonna be long?,Nellie
No. It's gonna be over before you know it.,Dwight
"[pretending to read news] Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented.",Erin
"Um, where did you get that story?",Darryl
"A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events.",Erin
"I love it. It's fantastic. Now, tag it with your name.",Andy
"For Channel 11 news, I'm Erin Hannon.",Erin
Pause after 'news'.,Andy
For Channel 11 news... I'm Erin Hannon.,Erin
"No, pause longer.",Andy
That was a good one.,Darryl
"Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don't be shy.",Andy
Got it. For Channel 11 news... [very long pause],Erin
"Wha, it's-",Andy
I'm Erin Hannon.,Erin
OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there.,Andy
[as Pam stares at him] I can feel you looking at me.,Jim
"OK. Well, here's something you don't know. A couple of weeks ago-",Pam
Uh-huh.,Jim
"I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know.",Pam
[after a pause] That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.,Jim
"Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me.",Pam
Uh... [looks at Pam],Jim
[looks knowingly back] Just tell me.,Pam
"God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.",Jim
"Heh! Ha! [making various sounds and movements while preparing to severe Nellie's hand] [Darryl enters, sees what's happening, and quietly exits]",Dwight
"Hey, um, I knew something bothered me and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna want to see is how Erin relates to the other people on the news team.",Pete
Oh.,Erin
The weird thing is Erin is doing the audition alone.,Pete
Oh god.,Erin
"Now, I'd say Clark could be your co-host... he's already doing camera.",Pete
Tuh.,Erin
"Someone who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know. [Andy smiles at camera]",Pete
Ha! [raises cleaver] This is for real this time.,Dwight
It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little [sets up laptop] inspiration.,Darryl
"[Darryl hits play] Oh, a movie. What is this?",Nellie
127 hours. It's about this guy who-,Darryl
"No, no. No spoilers. Please.",Dwight
My bad.,Darryl
No.,Dwight
Goodnight.,Darryl
"[answers his door to find Erin, Andy and Pete] Hey! Everybody.",Clark
Yeah.,Andy
Come in.,Clark
All right!,Andy
Come on in.,Clark
Nice.,Andy
[to Pete] What're you doing here?,Clark
"Sorry, man. Andy though Erin needed a co-anchor. I'm his makeup guy. My hands are tied.",Pete
[news anchor audition] The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.,Erin
"[also as anchor] Wow. You know what they say Erin. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.",Andy
"Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.",Erin
He sure did.,Andy
"All right. We got that. That's a rap, everybody.",Clark
Aw!,Erin
"Just, you sure Clark?",Andy
"Yep, she's done.",Clark
"No, I just, I don't mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn't feel good about that.",Andy
"No, we got it. We got it.",Clark
Great! Let's get some food. I'm starving.,Erin
"I don't think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing.",Andy
"OK, I don't.",Clark
All right.,Andy
I'm hungry.,Erin
"Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something?",Andy
"Yeah, whatever you say, boss.",Pete
OK. [to Erin] I'll call you later.,Andy
OK.,Erin
[to Clark] So this is a single.,Andy
"Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy.",Erin
[as he and Nellie watch the movie] Oh god.,Dwight
That is absolutely revolting!,Nellie
Yeah.,Dwight
"He is so good, though.",Nellie
Yes.,Dwight
The way he just cuts off his arm.,Nellie
"If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.",Dwight
"Well, he's a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU all at the same time.",Nellie
Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius.,Dwight
"Well, it doesn't make you stupid.",Nellie
"Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid.",Dwight
Stupid like you.,Nellie
"No, like you.",Dwight
Like you.,Nellie
You're the stupid one.,Dwight
You're the stupid one.,Nellie
You're the stupid one.,Dwight
You're the stupid one.,Nellie
"You, you, you, you...",Dwight
"Morning, Dwight",Fake Jim
Who are you?,Dwight
"Who am I? I'm Jim. We've been working together for twelve years. Ha, Weird joke, Dwight.",Fake Jim
You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian,Dwight
"You seriously never noticed? Hey, hats off to you for not seeing race.",Fake Jim
"Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?",Dwight
"Uh, Wellington systems? Sold them 10 cases of 24-pound letter stock. Or, were you talking about Krieger-Murphy? Because I didn't close that one yet, but I'm hoping I've got a voicemail from Paul Krieger waiting for me.",Fake Jim
Please enter your password.,Voicemail
You have one new message.,Voicemail
"How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!",Dwight
"Dwight, cut it out, I'm trying to work.",Fake Jim
You don't work here! You're not Jim!,Dwight
"Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico???s at 7:30.",Pam
"Oh great, can't wait. [Kisses Pam]",Fake Jim
Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.,Pam
"I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!",Dwight
"Oh my???! Oh d???! Oh, how did???? [gasps] Huhhhhh!",Dwight
Heyyy! Study buddies!,Erin
"Oh, ok.",Darryl
Getting things done. Awesome!,Erin
"It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!",Darryl
"Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let???s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. [pauses] Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.",Darryl
[speaking in French] S???il vous plait???dites-Moi???Ugggghhh les Bleagh!,Erin
"Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat.",Dwight
I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!,Erin
You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.,Dwight
"Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.",Dwight
I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French.,Dwight
Yeah! Let???s do it!,Erin
[exclaims] Atherozar!,Dwight
[shocked] Oh!,Erin
It means ???excellent???. And we have begun.,Dwight
[asks Nellie who is tapping a pen on her desk]. Is everything okay?,Pam
"Hmm? Oh???oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine. I'm mean, I d???I just don't wanna???burden you with my massive stress freak outs!",Nellie
Great.,Pam
"It???s just that I am taking my driver???s license test in two days, and I need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. But I've had no time to do that, thanks to ???Demandy???...[Points to Andy's office with her thumb]. I just want to hit the open road and drive, man! But???in who's car?",Nellie
[yells] Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here.,Andy
[sighs],Nellie
"Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.",Pam
"Oh, Pam, thank you! You are my savior! [hugs Pam]",Nellie
[giggling] ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!,Nellie and Pam
"[to Jim] I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch.",Pam
Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.,Jim
This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. We can't. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com,Nellie

As in...,Andy
"Wife of Barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children.",Nellie
[silently mouths] Wow!,Andy
This is super-flattering. She's the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.,Andy
"My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama.",Andy
"I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, ???What's your stance on politics???? Or, ???What is the best war to do???? And, I will just be like, ???Duhhhh!???",Erin
"Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh...I'm related to Michelle Obama.",Andy
"Yeah we noticed early on, Andy really appreciates enthusiasm.",Pete
So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.,Clark
Oooohhhhhhhh!,Clark
"It's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome.",Clark
"Yeah, me too. It's weird. Hard to remember what's real at this point.",Pete
"Just clap through it, man.",Clark
"You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ???em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching.",Darryl
"That was really good, Darryl.",Jim
"Life hacking, man.",Darryl
There he is!,Andy
"Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me???[gets interrupted by Andy].",Jim

"Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.",Darryl
It's me! [chuckles] I am related to Michelle Obama.,Andy
What?! Really?,Darryl
"I mean, it's distant, but...",Andy
"[chuckles in agreement] Huh ha! That's cool, man.",Darryl
Right?,Andy
"Darryl said, ???Cool, man.??? He called me as cool man.",Andy
"You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.",Pam
"Mmmm???the thing is Pam, I'm gonna be eating while I???m driving, so, I might as well get good at it.",Nellie
Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!,Pam
Whhooooo!,Nellie
"I???m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?",Oscar
You think that Andy's family owned slaves?,Phyllis
Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.,Stanley
I throat-rip.,Dwight
Foth aggendak!,Erin

Wah!! Aggenda!!,Erin
"Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh?",Pam
[laughs mischievously] Yeeeeahhhh! It's almost unbelievable!,Nellie
What?,Pam
"Well, you know how Andy has been really salting my onions, lately.",Nellie
Sure.,Pam
"Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up!",Nellie
So he's not related to Michelle Obama?,Pam
"Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer.",Nellie
[laughs],Pam
Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.,Pam
[whispers] Pam! [she pretends to slam a wrench over the tire service guy???s head].,Nellie
[laughs],Pam
"Well, if there???s another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I???[gets cut by Andy barging into the convo]",Oscar
"What's going on here? I'm related to the first lady, okay? Get over it. [chuckles] I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! [Mimicks smacking everyone with a whipl].",Andy
Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.,Oscar
Why? Is it employee???s day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.,Andy
"Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were???slave owners.",Oscar
Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners?,Andy
Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.,Darryl
"Hey mom, it's Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about America's national shame, thanks, Bye.",Andy
"Yes, yes, yes.",Darryl
"Great. Ooo! Spreadsheets! Yum, yum!",Andy
I included some time saving ideas...,Darryl
"Huh huh huh. Look, I'm not gonna lie to ya, I'm a teensy bit distracted right now.",Andy

Addor!,Erin

Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.,Pam
"[to Erin]. Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?",Andy
Vos!,Erin
"So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.",Andy
Because of your slaves.,Erin
"Not my slaves, my ancestors???. Maybe. Probably not.",Andy
"Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for ???slave master???, ???attafrauk!???, is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?",Erin
That you???re learning a made-up language from HBO???s Game of Thrones? I have a lot going on today...but this was a great nerd-out!,Andy
"Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.",Erin
"People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.",Dwight
Hi guys.,Andy
Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?,Phyllis
Yeah. You don't have to ask me.,Andy
"Ha ha! Okay. Great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happen to be???[ringtone of Dixie plays]. Very funny, Kevin. Changed my ringtone. Very funny. I liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was ???Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes??? by Paul Simon, featurinnnngg Lady Smith???African American???Mambazo.",Andy
"Good. Very good. [cell phone beeping]Oh???no! Here. It's, uh, a text from Andy. ???New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P.??? And then in parentheses, he wrote out ???as soon as possible.???",Pam
"Mm. Ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. Write back, ???looking for dirt.???",Nellie
"Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding.",Pam
"Pam, I'm related to Tonya Harding.",Nellie
Oh???gee???I???m???,Pam
No! I'm just practicing my lyyiiinggg! [whispers] I love it.,Nellie
Brilliant!,Pam
What should we say about Jim?,Nellie
Ummm. Oh! I'll say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up.,Pam
My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying. None of the sexual charisma. [pauses] I just made a joke there.,Nellie
"I'm sorry. It's just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there???s something Jim isn't telling me.",Pam
Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair!,Nellie
Jim? No.,Pam
[sighs]. How can you be sure?,Nellie
Because he just loves me too much.,Pam
"You're a cocky little thing, aren't you, Pam?",Nellie
"I've done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol??? family closet. For example, Phyllis's great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States.",Andy
Ew.,Angela
Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt.,Andy
And John Wayne?,Kevin
No. Not that I see here.,Andy

"Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True???[touches his nose] Oh no.",Jim
Dwight's grandfather was a???[is interrupted by Dwight].,Andy
Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So???[clears throat],Dwight
I was gonna say he was a tax evader.,Andy
"Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!",Dwight
And Meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden.,Andy
Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [mimics stabbing into Angela???s throat],Meredith
Stop it! Stop it! You're frightening me!,Angela
"Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?",Phyllis
"Yeah, that???you're being really mean, Andy.",Kevin
"Yeah, Andy.",Dwight
"No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it???s not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it.",Andy
"The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.",Oscar
Might've done. And how??? do you figure?,Andy
Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.,Oscar
"You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.",Andy
Really?,Oscar
"We merely transported them. Which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen.",Andy
"Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I'm trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had.",Andy
You???re gonna po??? mouth,Darryl
"Exactly. Help me po??? mouth, Darryl.",Andy
"Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions???",Darryl
"What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy?",Andy
That could work.,Darryl
"You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting. I'm coming up with all the ideas here.",Andy
I???m going for a walk.,Darryl
[with a sigh] Okay.,Andy
Good. Good. And???[Nellie hits the car against the bushes],Pam
"You doing alright, man?",Jim
I'm done. I gotta get out of here.,Darryl
Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.,Jim
"It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.",Darryl
"Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?",Jim
Hmm. Yeah right,Darryl
"No, I'm serious. There's always something better.",Jim
Like what?,Darryl
Like hypothetically??? if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.,Jim
What kind of job?,Darryl
"Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?",Jim
Hell yeah!,Darryl
Right?,Jim
That sounds awesome!,Darryl
"Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to...",Jim
I love Philly!,Darryl

"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man! And Pam's into it?",Darryl
"We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's???I think she understands... what this is.",Jim
"Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.",Darryl
"What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!",Jim
It's not real... until your wife is on board.,Darryl
So what did you want to show me?,Pam
"That is quite an ugly wall, isn't it?",Nellie
Yeah. It's really ugly,Pam
"Needs something, doesn't it? I'm thinking???a mural.",Nellie
You mean me?,Pam
Yes! You! You are soo talented! It???s going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton???s most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall.,Nellie
"Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I???Nellie, this is brilliant! [sees Jim] Hey!",Pam
Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?,Jim
"Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you!",Nellie
What?! No! I-I got this. [Laughs] Okay?,Pam
"[quietly] This is his fault. It is not your fault. I'm gonna find you someone better, and rich.",Nellie
And Filipino. But we???ll break that to her later.,Nellie
[to Darryl] You know what this is all about.,Nellie
"Yeah. You too, huh?",Darryl
"Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!",Nellie
Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too. [whispers] Yeah.,Darryl
"Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this.",Nellie
I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.,Jim
I still can't believe he didn't tell me.,Pam

"I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas.",Dwight
"OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.",Jim
"That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.",Dwight
"Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!",Jim
"Hey honey, I don't think we should push him.",Pam
"Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!",Jim
No!,Group
"Stop ordering me around, Jim!",Dwight
What do we want?!,Jim
Pies!,Group
When do we want it?!,Jim
Pies!,Group
"OK, fine. You win. Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. [drops keys in Jim's lap] Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.",Dwight
That's impossible. [Dwight climbs through ceiling hatch] Dwight!,Jim
Oh my!,Meredith
What are you doing?,Jim
"Dwight, what the hell?",Meredith
Dwight!,Oscar

Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back.,Kevin
[Dwight's footsteps sound from the ceiling] Just drive away. Just..,Phyllis
Phyllis! That's not safe.,Pam
"Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left. At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it.",Kevin
[to Jim] Go up and check on him. He's upset.,Pam
You know he's doing all this on purpose.,Jim
Please? Just make sure he's OK? [Jim climbs through hatch],Pam
Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream!,Stanley
Banana cream is the first to go. We'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point! [group gasps],Andy
What?,Meredith
Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-,Jim
"I'm barren, Jim.",Dwight
What?,Jim
My trouser hives are void of honey. I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.,Dwight
"Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.",Jim
You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?,Dwight
No.,Jim
That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done. [laughs],Dwight
I'll take it.,Jim
Andy?,Nellie
Who is it?,Andy
"Um, is this a good time?",Nellie
"Yeah. Perfect time. I'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis. [takes paper from Nelly] Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok, [reading] blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable.",Andy
"Oh, why, is there something?",Nellie
"It's inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? Dongwater.",Andy
"Ah well, perhaps I could rewrite some of the-",Nellie
"Here's the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time. Good luck with your impossible dream.",Andy
Alright then.,Nellie
"Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.",Jim
Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?,Dwight
That doesn't matter.,Jim
What position did you use to conceive?,Dwight
Ok...that's not...,Jim
"Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.",Dwight
[To Pete. Crying sounds come from behind Nelly's curtain] British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?,Andy
I don't think that's Nelly.,Pete
What?,Andy
"Oh, oh no, no. Look, it's alright. [Erin cries, Nelly comforts her] It really isn't your fault. No, no. Look, it's...you were so kind. And it isn't anything to do with you.",Nellie
"Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?",Jim
You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.,Dwight
"Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..",Jim
Bildenkinder.,Dwight
OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.,Jim
Oh! [Jim reenters bus through hatch] Hey! How'd it go?,Pam
It's pretty good actually.,Jim
Yeah?,Pam
We bonded. We got to- [Dwight starts dropping into the bus on top of Jim],Jim
Whoa! Whoa! Dwight! [group reacts],Oscar
When you don't get out of the way! Out of the way!,Dwight
You feel OK now?,Pam
"Oh, better than OK. [grabs Pam's shoulders] You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie.",Dwight
"Well, actually, rhubarb is-",Pam
Don't..,Jim
the one pie that I don't.,Pam
Don't..,Jim
Everybody! Hang on! [Dwight pulls out quickly],Dwight
Oh! [bus tears around corners as group crashes into each other],Angela
[Group chants along] Pie! Pie! Pie!,Jim
Pie! Pie! Pie! Pie! [cheers as they arrive],Group
Oh.,Nellie
I changed my mind. [gives Nelly papers],Andy
"Oh, you signed it?",Nellie
"Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple changes. Added some sentences at the end. Trust me it needed it. [laughs] Well, yeah, whatever. So. [walks away]",Andy
"[Reading] ???She's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents.???",Nellie
"I insult you, Oscar.",Kevin
What?,Oscar
I insult you! To your face!,Kevin
I don't know what you're talking about.,Oscar
Then why don't you do something about it?,Kevin
"[laughs] Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?",Oscar
"You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face! [Oscar pies Kevin] Yes!",Kevin

[screaming upon seeing pumpkin-headed Dwight],Erin
[screaming then laughing] It may have been the costliest decision I???ve ever made.,Dwight
"My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ...",Dwight
It won???t budge.,Jim
I can???t get it out. Try again!,Dwight
"I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin...",Dwight
"[as Jim approaches with a knife] Jim, no. No. No! No!",Dwight
But as Jim and I discovered... No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.,Dwight
At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?,Dwight
Hey guys.,Erin
Hey.,Pam
"Pam, what are you?",Erin
I am Dr. Cinderella.,Pam
Cece???s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.,Jim
I???m an oncologist and you are a dog.,Pam
"No, I???m a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.",Erin
It???s Okay.,Jim
"Uh, Jim, you???re not dressed up at all.",Erin

The senator will be joining us later.,Angela
Not a question.,Andy
"No, it wasn???t.",Angela
"Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere.",Andy

Something wrong Dwight?,Nellie
Dumatril.,Dwight

This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it???s not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It???s not for any disorder of the body. [whispering] It???s for a disorder of the mind.,Dwight
The mind is part of the body.,Nellie
"Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... [whispering] They are now off their meds.",Dwight
"Dwight, our co-workers??? health issues are really none of our business so-",Nellie
"Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What???s going on Nellie? Talk to me.",Dwight
Hm?,Nellie
"It???s my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I???m not ashamed of that, But I???m not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong.",Nellie
"Yeah, you???re right. This man needs to be apprehended.",Nellie
I???ll get my apprehension kit.,Dwight
Ruh duh duh da dudes! What???s up?,Andy
[mumbled responses],HCT
"I know that it???s pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, that???s when I became somebody. When I got the nickname 'Boner Champ,' that is when I became me.",Andy
"You didn???t come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, now???s your chance! I???m here. You got Qs; I got As.",Andy

I thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ.,HCT Member #2
"I???m sorry, what?",Andy
I just thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ.,HCT Member #2
Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.,Andy
I didn???t realize that everybody here dresses up every year.,Pete
Me neither.,Creed
"It???s Halloween. That is really, really good timing.",Creed
"I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that you???re Boner Champ.",Andy
[on computer monitor] I???m so sorry! I don???t know how that could have happened.,Broccoli Rob
Did you maybe tell them that or...?,Andy
"I just-- I just started yappin??? about the old days, and I guess the wine coolers were flowing, and, you know, somehow things just got hinky.",Broccoli Rob
"Could you just call them and tell them the truth? 'Cause I know it???s really stupid, but it???s also really, really, really important.",Andy
"Will do. I love you, Andy.",Broccoli Rob

All right. [laughs] Awesome. Cool.,Jim
Hi Daryl. I???m just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.,Dwight
"You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.",Nellie
"That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?",Dwight
"I can???t really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.",Darryl
So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?,Dwight
Get under your chin first. Yeah.,Darryl
Is that where the nanobots like to come in?,Dwight
"Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.",Darryl

Did he tell you how I got the name?,Andy
No.,HCT Member #3

"And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?",Angela
"Senator Lipton, nice to see you.",Oscar
Nice to see you Oscar.,Senator Lipton

"All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill.",Dwight
"Okay, look Dwight, let???s just call this thing off. I mean, it???s just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety.",Nellie
You think I don???t have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I???ve got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne???er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don???t need some stupid pill to get me through all this.,Dwight
Cool. Free upper.,Meredith

"Ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!",Andy
[vocalizing],HCT
They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?,Pam
"No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.",Jim
So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?,Pam
You weren???t there.,Jim
[singing ???I???ll Be???],HCT

[clapping],All
[singing ???Faith???],HCT
No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man...,Andy

"Russell, I???m dressed like George Michael.",Andy
I thought you were Adam Lambert.,HCT Member #3
Wha...?,Andy
"The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it???s kind of pathetic. But when you???re with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.",Erin
Are you okay?,Erin
[on screen] He???s still mad.,Broccoli Rob
"Shut up, Broccoli.",Andy
"Champ, I feel awful about this whole thing. Russell called me up. And they said they needed 20 cc???s of George Michael stat. So just... Wham! I sprang into action. You know me. I assumed you wanted to hear me do your signature number.",Broccoli Rob
"You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man???s signature solo is his for life, okay? That???s group policy and you know it.",Andy
"Look, it???s not my fault that I still live near campus, and it???s my duty as an alum to be friendly to the young guys., and stop in two, three times a week.",Broccoli Rob
Just don???t do the song anymore.,Andy
"I tell you what, we???ll have a sing-off for it. You pick twelve alums from any year to back you up and I???ll do the same, and I???m so confident that I???ll win, I won???t even warm up.",Broccoli Rob
"Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes.",Andy
"My pipes are primo, Champ. Why don???t you ask Trey Anastasio about my pipes?",Broccoli Rob
"I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!",Andy
"He said, and I quote, ???Hey Rob, nice pipes???. That happened!",Broccoli Rob
"OK, fine, yeah. that???s one guy???s opinion!",Andy
That's real. 'That???ll never change!,Broccoli Rob
Okay!,Erin
Doesn???t mean you???re the best singer ever. Dick.,Andy
I thought that concert was pretty great.,Jim
Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.,Kevin
They lost me when they sang ???Monster Mash???. That song obviously glorifies the occult.,Angela
"Angela, it???s Halloween. You have to sing ???Monster Mash???.",Jim
Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?,Pam
Uh...,Jim
"No I???m just, I???m saying, what would happen if they didn???t sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?",Pam
"Okay. We???ll, just forget it.",Jim
"No! No, I???m interested. I mean I think everybody???s interested in why they have to sing it.",Pam
"Because it is Halloween. So if you???re going to sing a concert, it???s a good idea to throw that one in.",Jim
"Yeah, yeah, no, no. It???s a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can???t do if you just keep singing ???Monster Mash.???",Pam
"It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates ???Monster Mash.??? I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!",Kevin
This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell?,Andy
[laughing] Yeah.,Erin
"I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time?",Andy
"Oh well, Andy, we???re not moving to Cornell.",Erin
Duh. I know. That would be insane.,Andy
Yeah.,Erin
It could totally work though. I don???t know why we wouldn???t. Oh my god are we doing this?,Andy
"Oy. Andy, what???s going on?",Erin
"If I am not Boner Champ, I don???t know who I am.",Andy
"Well, um, you know maybe you???re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--",Erin
Make a donation.,Andy
"Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.",Erin
Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom.,Andy
Oh.,Erin
[whispering] I want some of those pills.,Dwight
"Oh, well good for you. I mean, you???ll need a prescription.",Nellie

"Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he???s a good man and that I hope he feels better.",Nellie
Which one? Mose or the real Mose?,Dwight
The real Mose.,Nellie
He says Thank you.,Dwight
"[on phone] Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there. [pause] What?",Andy
What???s wrong?,Erin
My parents are broke.,Andy
[to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute?,Oscar
"I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair. I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. [turns to see Kevin has overheard him]...Why?",Oscar
"Alright, good. Yeah. Just sell it and get the best price you can, okay?",Andy
Or we can hope for a holiday rally?,White
"White, I'm not a day trader, I'm just a first responder in a disaster.",Andy
Andy's family had a total meltdown. His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.,Pam
"And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.",Jim
The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he's been handling it is just..so..,Pam
Competent.,Jim
Right?,Pam
"Are the 'Nard's hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I'm kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so, [bleep] him.",Andy
"Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?",Oscar
"That's beautiful. No, I totally get that.",Kevin
"Can you do this, Kevin?",Oscar
"I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.",Kevin
"I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-",Oscar
"[On phone] Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you. [hangs up] Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?",Pam
"Yeah, she hosts the Dr. Laura Show.",Creed
"Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? [Dwight raises hand]",Pam
I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.,Dwight
"The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous? [Pretends to be on phone] ???Uh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt.??? It's that easy.",Dwight
"Hey, so that good looking single brother of yours? Heard he's on a downward spiral with booze.",Meredith
Yeah. He's in rehab actually.,Andy
Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour.,Meredith
"No, it's in New Mexico.",Andy
Oh...So..- how are you holding up?,Meredith
We're done Meredith.,Andy
"[wagging tongue for voice exercises] blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...[Group protests]",Dwight
Dwight!,Jim
"...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason.",Dwight
"No, you chose yourself.",Jim
[walking away] Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit....,Dwight
"Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal. Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom.",Andy
Sounds great.,Darryl
Perfect.,Oscar
"Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So...what else we got? Non-boat ideas. [Oscar looks outside conference room at Kevin and Angela at the copier]",Andy
What happened?,Kevin
Jammed. This day couldn't get worse. [Kevin laughs],Angela
"Yeah, I think this day could get worse.",Kevin
What does that mean?,Angela
Kevin!,Oscar
[to Angela] I don't know what you're talking about. [Thumbs up Oscar],Kevin
She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.,Erin
"Alright, what's the grand total? Did we make our nut?",Andy
"If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months.",Darryl
"Guys, you don't understand, this boat's been in our family since before I was born.",Andy
Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?,Erin
I worked at a Jiffy Lube.,Darryl
See? I bet you wouldn???t sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?,Erin
I would if I owned it and I went broke.,Darryl
"Alright, uh...alright. I'm gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat.",Andy
"Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don't need the boat. Can't cry about it. What are you gonna do? Cry about it? [chokes up] Excuse me.",Andy
"[On phone] Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called. The interview's off. They're opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so...",Pam
Well why don't I go and tell Dwight so he can stop being such a complete nipple.,Nellie
He's gonna be disappointed.,Pam
Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.,Jim
Fax?,Pete
"Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy. [laughs] He's seriously juvenile.",Erin
"Cool. He's like 40 though, right?",Pete
"Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops.",Erin
Awesome. Have fun.,Pete
"Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds- [phone rings in break room, Dwight picks up] This is Dwight Shrute.",Dwight
[on other end in conference room] Please hold for Ms. Black.,Pam
[Darryl plays radio show music on keyboard] And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin's senior sales associate Dwight Shrute.,Nellie
"Iris, thank you so much for having me.",Dwight
[muffled by watermelon teeth] Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth. [laughs],Erin
"Uh, did you need something?",Andy
"Oh, I just need your signature on this.",Erin
Ok. [signs paper] thanks.,Andy
"Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?",Angela
I... did not.,Kevin
I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.,Angela
"[laughing in Oscar's direction] Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! [Oscar makes sound trying to get him to shut up] I have to go to the bathroom!",Kevin
That doesn't surprise me.,Angela
"That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.",Oscar
[In staff meeting] See these forms...,Jim
I have to go to the bathroom! [runs out],Kevin
[running from elevator] I have to go to the bathroom!,Kevin
"[Drives away waving, then screeches to a stop and runs from car]",Kevin
"Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?",Erin
"Look, it's not that I don't want-",Andy
"Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect.",Erin
"All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn't let me. Said ???You can't be a skipper until you're a man.??? You know, I'd reach for the wheel and he'd smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I'm the man of the family and... we're selling the damn thing. So I'm never gonna have the chance.",Andy
"Well, when does the boat leave, exactly?",Erin
Tonight.,Andy
Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail.,Erin
"Yeah right. It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now.",Andy
"Ok, well then let's leave like right now.",Erin
"Yeah, ok.",Andy
Yeah! OK! Let's go.,Erin
Seriously?,Andy
"Of course, seriously. Get your coat on.",Erin
Alright.,Andy
Alright.,Erin
Let's do it.,Andy
Let's do it!,Erin
"[On speakerphone] Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on.",Dwight
[As Iris] So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command?,Nellie
"Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris.",Dwight
"Uh, excuse me. [reading card held up by Jim] I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons?",Nellie
Yes..?,Dwight
[Jim mimes taking shirt off] I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together.,Nellie
"[Takes shirt off] Now then, we were saying. When my workers-gather-",Dwight
"Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. [Jim holds up card that says ???Now Pants???] Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine.",Nellie
That's impossible.,Dwight
Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper?,Nellie
The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.,Angela
That's a tough one.,Oscar
That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can.,Angela
"Please, stop.",Kevin
What?,Angela
"Please, stop.",Kevin
"Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in. [Kevin laughs]",Angela
"[Getting up to leave] I can't, it's too much! [laughing]",Kevin
I'm in big trouble.,Oscar
"Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble.",Kevin
"[pantless] OK, how is my voice now?",Dwight
"I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic?",Nellie
[holding hand over phone] This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me.,Dwight
[looking at folder he brought Toby]It's clearly not an accounting mistake.,Oscar
Yeah.,Toby
So...,Oscar
Kevin. His gambling problem must've resurfaced. I'm gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation.,Toby
"Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.",Oscar
"This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! [Pam tells Jim to leave the conference room] I dare you to produce one credible source about this.",Dwight
"Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc...Sandra Mick [points to Pam]",Nellie
"[changing voice] Good afternoon Iris, it's a pleasure.",Pam
Let's get straight to the point. Is your paper toxic?,Nellie
No the paper's not toxic.,Pam
Thank you Sandra!,Dwight
Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!,Pam
Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled! [Jim runs panicked into break room],Dwight
What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!,Jim
Get out of here moron! [Jim leaves],Dwight
"Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to?",Nellie
uhhhh....no one.,Dwight
Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron?,Nellie
"No, everything's fine.",Dwight
Are you insulting my guests?,Nellie
[chokes up],Dwight
"[on phone] Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion?",Kevin
"I hope that's it, Kevin.",Oscar
"Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that.",Kevin
"Hi, Kevin. Look, I need to talk to you about-",Toby
Hi.,Kevin
"Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..",Oscar
"Oscar, we're in the middle of talking.",Kevin
"Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me. [gives Kevin money]",Oscar
Oh that is nice. Classy move. [leaves],Kevin
[yelling in break room] That's what I'm saying! No of course not!,Dwight
What are you doing?,Kevin
Those figures I gave you? They're false.,Oscar
How?,Toby
"I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.",Oscar
So you set him up.,Toby
"Yes, he's innocent.",Oscar
I knew it. I knew it from the beginning it was possible.,Toby
What are you talking about? I just did this now.,Oscar
"A few years ago, when I was on the jury of the Scranton Strangler..",Toby
Sure.,Oscar
I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict.,Toby
That's gotta be tough.,Oscar
Tough? I put an innocent man on death row.,Toby
"The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%. Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time?",Nellie
"My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!",Dwight
That's yours?,Erin
That's the family boat!,Andy
"Oh my gosh, Andy! This is enormous!",Erin
Right?,Andy
I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.,Erin
Move.,Boat Guy
Sorry?,Andy
Trying to rig a boat here. I don't know how to do that when you're standing in the way.,Boat Guy
"Sure, I um..I didn't know.",Andy
"I'm not a ghost, so I can't walk through people.",Boat Guy
Ok.,Andy
"Gee, he was salty.",Erin
"Geez, a little bit. [to boat] How you doing old buddy? Missed you.",Andy
What does that one do?,Erin
It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing.,Andy
I wish I had seen you do it.,Erin
Really?,Andy
Yeah.,Erin
[Begins raising sail] Up she goes!,Andy
Don't do that. Don't do that.,Boat Guy
"Oh, it's OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me.",Andy
Nope. Can't do that.,Boat Guy
"You got it. You know what then, we'll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor. [begins raising sail, boat guy slaps his hand]",Andy
We've already started boarding. And no one is insured to rig her up right now except us.,Boat Guy
"You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just- [Raises sail, guys slaps hand again] wow.",Andy
I can smack you all day if you keep touching what you're not supposed to touch.,Boat Guy
"Ok, fine.",Andy
OK.,Boat Guy
"Yeah, fine.",Andy
Good stuff.,Boat Guy
"Good stuff. Nice stuff. [begins raising sail again when guy leaves, but he comes back and smacks Andy's hand again] [bleep] Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah.",Andy
"Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat.",Erin
I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.,Andy
"Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man.",Erin
Fine. But I could have.,Andy
"As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain.",Erin
I am the captain.,Andy
Yeah.,Erin
Right?,Andy
Yeah.,Erin
"I'm the captain. [to boat guy] Hey, charm school.",Andy
What?,Boat Guy
I'm taking it over from here.,Andy
Nice!,Erin
"I hate to uh, ruin this moment...or breakdown, but you already signed the papers. So, if you want your boat back, you can pick it up there in the Bahamas in 10 days.",Boat Guy
"Yeah, I know cause I'm sailing it there.",Andy
"OK, no. I already said, you're not getting back your deposit.",Boat Guy
"Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater?",Andy
"For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich. Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company's stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson [points to Jim].",Nellie
[using black voice] Good afternoon! [Darryl smacks his arm],Jim
Please sir! Spare him. Please.,Dwight
"Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!",Jim
"Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in.",Dwight
"Oh, Mr. Shrute, there's really no need to, um involve Mr... Wallace.",Nellie
Do you even know what you're doing?,Erin
"Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to...I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello. [Opens door, Andy's brother is passed out inside] Walt?",Andy
"Oh god, thank goodness you're here. I was having a little trouble with this door. Yesterday. I um, I think it was yesterday.",Walt Jr.
I thought you were in rehab.,Andy
"Yeah, uh, I just, I figured I'd get that first relapse out of the way. God, what's happened to our family? Everything is so messed up! How did you even know I was in here?",Walt Jr.
"I didn't. I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat. But I've decided to sail it to Bermuda.",Andy
"Bahamas, Andy.",Erin
"Same thing. [To Walt] Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on.",Andy

"You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?",Dwight
Dwight?,David Wallace
Walk out of the house...,Dwight

"Well, I am sorry Kevin.",Oscar
Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?,Angela
You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. [Senator enters],Kevin

No.,Oscar
Oscar? What is going on? What was that?,Angela
"What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't mean any offense. I was just trying to be friendly.",Senator Liptop
You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who-,Oscar
"Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support. [claps, group joins]",Kevin

It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A!,Kevin
U..s..a. U-,Oscar

"What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!",Andy
"Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?",Erin

The White Pages.,Dwight
"The White Pages: Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There???s a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing ???the White Whale???. Look at all that sweet blubber.",Dwight
"Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you.",David
I???m gonna need to put you on hold for a second. [presses hold button] Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where???s Stanley?,Dwight

Ew. That???s not good.,Nellie
"Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.",Phyllis
???Gy-na??? said that?,Dwight

I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela???s husband spoon me back to bed.,Oscar
"When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.",Angela

"Oh, I???ll be the buyer.",Pam
[sighing],Dwight
"Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.",Pam
I never sit down during sales meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes,Dwight
"No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.",Phyllis
"I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I???m finished, it???s over.",Dwight
"Okay, let???s stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?",Pam
I thought it went great.,Dwight
"I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me?",Nellie

Yes.,Dwight
"Okay, well you have to show us.",Pam
"That???s impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don???t vibrate at all.",Dwight
Huh. [nodding] Uh huh.,Pam
What are you doing?,Dwight
A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?,Pam
Kind of.,Dwight
"Nellie, why don???t you tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you???re listening.",Pam
"Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I???ve commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking color schemes and the major themes we want to hit. Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper. But not in a child labor-y way.",Nellie
"It???s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.",Erin
I am a person.,Dwight
Yes.,Erin
And then we thought we???d ??? I can???t. I just can???t carry on with that face. Look at it. I???m gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he???s laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.,Nellie
That???s a bit extreme.,Dwight
"No, I???m sorry but that is true.",Nellie
He???s screwed. They???re meeting in less than an hour.,Meredith
"Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It???s all garbage okay? You???re the woman, I???m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.",Phyllis
"Okay, I???m a woman. [high voice] I???m a woman. Good?",Dwight
"Ms. Thomas, so good to see you.",Phyllis
Hello.,Dwight
"Oh, are those your kids? They???re so cute! They could be models.",Phyllis
Thank you. I???m so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.,Dwight
Booo! Weird.,Meredith
No.,Nellie
"Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It???s hopeless.",Phyllis
"Ten years ago, I didn???t care if Dwight got married or died a beet-farming bachelor. But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I???m like, that poor gimp is somebody???s child.",Pam
"You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.",Pam
"Look, I have no problem with women. It???s businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don???t lie about your shoulders!",Dwight
"Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?",Pam
I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.,Dwight
"Okay, so, when you???re selling to this woman, just imagine that she???s that nice, reasonable barber.",Pam
"Okay, I can do that.",Dwight
Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.,Pam
He used to fight dogs.,Dwight
"Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?",Pam
"Little of this, little of that.",Dwight
Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.,Angela
Angela! [whispering] Angela. There.,Oscar
Where?,Angela
"[whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.",Oscar
"Oh my God! She???s so stunningly tiny! She???s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they???re doing.",Angela
She???s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.,Oscar
"[gasps] I???ve heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I???d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let???s go.",Angela
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...",Oscar
Ow.,Angela
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.",Oscar
[sound effect of throwing ball],Pete
"This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun.",Toby
"What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --",Jim
"[on phone] It was in what? Jim, we???re having a lot of trouble hearing you.",Business partner
The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was...[car alarm blaring] was in the...,Jim
Hey! Are those skateboarders back?,Hank
"[on phone] Jim? Jim, are you there?",Business partner
Where are they?,Hank
"It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...",Jim
Who was messing with my van?,Meredith
Nobody!,Jim
"[on phone] Jordan wore them for nobody? We???re not following you, Halpert.",Business partner
"No, no, no.",Jim
This ends now!,Hank
"Have a seat. Um, she will be right in.",Secretary
"Oh, great. Oh, I???m sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don???t have it.",Pam
Uh... um she???ll be right in.,Secretary
"Okay, great.",Pam
"[to himself] Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.",Dwight
Oh my God. It???s Jan.,Pam
"Oh, dear God in heaven.",Dwight
"Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.",Pam
You son of a bitch. You???re firing me? Where the hell do you get off?,Jan
"Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?",Pam
"Forget everything we taught you. Hey, Jan! It???s so great to see you.",Pam
Where???s Wallace?,Jan
What?,Pam
"I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?",Jan
Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off. [laughs],Dwight
"Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.",Pam
Molly! David Wallace is in Vermont.,Jan
"Oh, my God. Um, I talked to his assistant. And I guess it did get a little confusing ???cause you said not to tell anyone your name. And then also, those bluetooths are very hard to hear with. I know you love the way they look, but Tom never had us use them...",Molly
Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.,Jan
I???m so sorry Jan.,Molly
"I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace after all these years. Oh, well. What are you doing?",Jan
Listening.,Dwight
Stop.,Jan
Sorry.,Dwight
Stop that.,Jan
Okay.,Dwight
So this was all just a trick. You don???t really have any business to give?,Pam
"No, I do.",Jan
But not to us.,Pam
"Insightful, Pam.",Jan
"You did good, Dwight. It???s okay. I mean, seriously, Jan???s not normal. Let???s just go. She???s not going to sell to us.",Pam
"Yes, she is. Now, I may not have any instincts with women, but I have an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I???ll be right back.",Dwight
What?,Pam
Pam?,Jan
Yeah.,Pam
"I???m a very busy woman, so...",Jan
"Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?",Pam
Fine. I will show you one... slide show.,Jan
"Erin, did this call...",Pete
Uh!,Erin
What?,Pete
"Sorry, I uh, just saw your face.",Erin
"Oh, I???m sorry. It???s for the thing.",Pete
I know. That???s great. It just - it makes it look like there???s an eyebrow in the middle of your face.,Erin
Wow.,Pete
"A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn???t bad.",Erin
Uh-huh.,Pete
"But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It???s such a great cause.",Erin
Yeah.,Pete
[chuckles],Erin
"[audio from slide show, singing] Mommy, you???re a princess. Mommy, you???re a superstar. Mommy you???re the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?",Jan
Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.,Pam
Aw.,Jan
And it is so cute how she signs her name.,Pam
"[chuckles] Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.",Jan
"Oh, okay. It???s just that???s how Cece does it with the backwards ???E???s.",Pam
Cece can???t spell her name.,Jan
"Oh, actually she can.",Pam
"Well, it???s not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, ???Cece??? is two letters and ???Astrid??? is... I mean, there???s even some adults who -- who -- who can???t spell it.",Jan
Of course.,Pam
"Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.",Jan
Um... ???A???... ???X???? I don???t -- you got me.,Pam
Don???t patronize me.,Jan
[whispering] I???m so sorry. I hate this. You???re better.,Pam
"[whispering] Okay, we should go now. Let???s go.",Angela
[stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs],Oscar
Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can???t get enough of the show? Your jollies are all on fire --,Angela
[whispering] Please. It???s Robert who???s enjoying it.,Oscar
What?,Angela
"This could be the affair that you???re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. [pause] But uh, he???s probably not gay. He???s straight. He???s straight, so...",Oscar
Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?,Pam
No.,Jan
Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I???ve got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.,Dwight
"Oh, my God.",Pam
Where???s the Quizno???s?,Clark
"You???re the Quizno???s. [chuckles] Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn???t quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?",Dwight
I -- I --,Jan
Hmm?,Dwight
"I don???t recall. And yes, Molly is crap.",Jan
"Okay, you do not have to do this.",Pam
Do what? Get into sales? That???s what I want.,Clark
He???s been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.,Dwight
"Will you uh, [clicks tongue] you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.",Jan
Very good.,Dwight
[to Clark] Do you have a valid passport?,Jan
Jim Halpert.,Jim
"[on phone] Hey, it???s Colin.",Colin
Hey man. I am so sorry about that.,Jim
I know. Don???t worry about it.,Colin
[laughs],Jim
It???s just... it???s not totally working.,Colin
"Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don???t worry. I???ll figure it out.",Jim
"Yeah, well, it???s not just not ideal. I mean, with you there, I don???t know how we???re gonna do this.",Colin
"Uh, what does -- what does that mean?",Jim
"Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?",Angela
"I don???t know, Angela. I???m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.",Oscar
"Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?",Angela
He???s making a phone call.,Oscar
[ducking under table with Oscar] Oh. Oh.,Angela
"[phone vibrates, rings]",Oscar
"Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit.",Pam
Thanks. Okay.,Molly
"Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can???t be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.",Dwight
"Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.",Pam
"Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL.",Dwight
That???s a license number?,Pam
"That???s all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.",Dwight
Oh. Why me?,Pam
"Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It???s like air to you people. Ugh, God. [retching]",Dwight
"Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I???m having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she???s cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it???s business as usual.",Oscar
Good morning. [clears throat],Oscar
Oscar... [sighs] can I ask you a question?,Angela
"[whispering] Of course, ask me a que-- ??questions.",Oscar
Is it cool in here to you?,Angela
"[hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes.",Oscar
I think the thermostat is acting up again.,Angela
"It???s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I???m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I???ll just go downstairs.",Oscar
Thank you.,Angela
"No, thank you, Angela.",Oscar
"She doesn???t know. I shouldn???t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.",Oscar
"Well, well, well, it???s finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.",Dwight
These are my painting clothes.I think I???m gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today. [Jim applauds],Pam
"Sure you don???t want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.",Meredith
"You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?",Jim
Are you avoiding your phone call?,Pam
"What? Yeah, right. As if.",Jim
"Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.",Jim
"Last week Jim wasn???t there, and they named the company Athlead.",Pam
I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.,Jim
Tell them your opening line.,Pam
"[sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy who???s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?",Jim
I think it???s good. He likes fishing.,Pam
This is gonna be awful.,Jim
"One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they???re in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information???s already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to ???chillax,??? and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don???t give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house. ??Fight the power.",Pete
"Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.",Angela
[upon seeing Dwight naked] Ugh!,Angela
"Come on in, the water???s fine.",Dwight
"Dwight, it???s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.",Angela
I know. That???s not why I???m naked. I always work out without my clothes. [does jumping jacks],Dwight
Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.,Angela
"Oh, I???m sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I???m not in your panties, I don???t go vigilantes. Why don???t you ask your husband?",Dwight
My marriage is in danger. I don???t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.,Angela
"[sighs] All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?",Dwight
Something like that.,Angela
"Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.",Dwight
Can you arrange a meeting?,Angela
I can try. I???m gonna use SMS text.,Dwight
Okay.,Angela
Text went through.,Dwight
Okay.,Angela
All we can do is sit and wait.,Dwight
Okay.,Angela
"[phone vibrates] Oh, look at that. Yeah, he???s free anytime. Not a problem.",Dwight
"I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.",Jim
"[on phone] Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there???s a crisis -- the more I think about it --",David
"Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I???m gone.",Jim
They did?,David
Yep.,Jim
"Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work.",David
"Oh, great.",Jim
Why should we help you?,Stanley
Because we???re friends.,Jim
When is my birthday?,Stanley
Unfair. When???s my birthday?,Jim
"I don???t know, because we???re not friends.",Stanley
"How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?",Jim
Now we???re talkin???.,Stanley
All right.,Jim
Yeah.,Phyllis
Make it go taller.,Kevin
That???s the idea.,Pete
"No, not taller this way, taller this way. [gesturing with hands]",Kevin
"Well, I???ve gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher.",Pete
"You???re not getting this, Peter. ??Make it go wider... up!",Kevin
Will do.,Pete
[entering] What are y???all doing?,Darryl
Me and Pete are building a tower.,Kevin
"Cool. It should be taller though, right?",Darryl
"Obviously. He???s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he???s not the sharpest guy in the drawer.",Kevin
"Kevin, I can hear you.",Pete
Huh?,Kevin
Ow! Dwight! Ow!,Angela
Get in the van.,Dwight
God!,Angela
Is it safe to talk?,Trevor
"Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don???t see them so I think we???re good.",Dwight
So what are your credentials?,Angela
"I started following people around to get exercise. Turns out, I???m damn good at it.",Trevor
Do you have a gun?,Angela
[snickers] Does he own a gun? Show her.,Dwight
You tell me.,Trevor
What is this?,Angela
It???s the receipt for my gun.,Trevor
You don???t carry it with you?,Angela
Read the receipt. That???s a $300 gun. Someone could steal it.,Trevor
Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor???s had stolen from him?,Dwight
Now I keep it in a safe.,Trevor
Mm-hmm. Good safe?,Dwight
"Oh, you tell me. [shows Dwight receipt]",Trevor
Wow!,Dwight
"[studying mural wall] I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It???s just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I???m gonna limit myself to one shrub.",Pam
You paint wall now?,Hide
Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that...,Pam
You paint now.,Hide
It???s probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.,Pam
I wait.,Hide
Sweet.,Meredith
Yay!,Erin
That???s what I???m talkin??? about.,Darryl
"This next card comes to us thanks to Meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote ???sausage factory.???",Pete
Oh OOOH!,Meredith
[approving cheers],Everyone
Boom!,Meredith
Bang.,Darryl
"Yep, yep, yep.",Kevin
All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed.,Pete
Let???s find out what I did.,Creed
All right.,Pete
You get half now and half upon completion of said job.,Dwight
And that???s all off the books?,Trevor
Obviously.,Angela
Nice. No taxes.,Trevor
"Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.",Angela
So what???s the job?,Trevor
Murder.,Angela
"Okay, that???s the big one. That???s the big ???M.???",Trevor
You can???t have someone murdered.,Dwight
What if they deserved it?,Angela
"What did they do to you, Angela?",Dwight
They???re sleeping with my husband.,Angela
"Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you.",Dwight
This seems a little crazy.,Trevor
Yes. Crazy. Thank you.,Dwight
But I think I???m up for it.,Trevor
No! No!,Dwight
Thank you.,Angela
"Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I???ve had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--",Dwight
That???s very effective. I???ve been on the receiving end of that quite a few times. It???s devastating.,Trevor
"No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.",Angela
What about a knee-capping?,Trevor
"No! You???re not helping, Trevor!",Dwight
"Yes, a knee-capping could work.",Angela
No. Angela! What are you saying?,Dwight
You said you would be there for me.,Angela
"I???m trying, but what you???re asking is--",Dwight
It???s the only thing that will make this right.,Angela
"Okay. But it???s cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can???t scrub worth a damn.",Dwight
"All right, then it???s settled. One knee-capping. Now, the hit goes down at 4:00. Keep in mind, once I leave, there???s no turning back.",Trevor
"You know, truth be told, I think all you???ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I???m gone.",Jim
We???ve got all afternoon to talk about that.,Stanley
"Morning, folks.",Waiter
I???ll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.,Stanley
"Actually, the surf and turf does come with lob--",Waiter
Not enough lobster. Side order.,Stanley
How much wine do you have?,Phyllis
I brought you a cookie.,Oscar
"Oh, thanks, Oscar. You???re such an angel.",Angela
"[talking into phone] I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we???re good. Yeah. [exhales] We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.",Oscar
There we go.,Pete
[cheers and applause],Everyone
"Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex.",Pete
Oooohh... you salty dog.,Nellie
"Well, yeah, what can I say, a player???s gotta play.",Darryl
There you go.,Pete
"Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I???m gonna let them think the other thing.",Darryl
"Okay, I got this one.",Kevin
"Oh, be careful! Be careful! Be careful",Nellie
"No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.",Kevin
[shouting as tower collapses] Oh no! Kevin!,Everyone
What did I just say? What did I just say?,Nellie
"Hey, hey, hey, it???s just a mistake. Just a mistake. That???s what this tower???s all about -- ??mistakes. Okay, if you???re afraid of screwing up, the tower???s not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? That???s right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let???s get back to work, huh? Come on, you in?",Pete
Yeah.,Kevin
"There we go. All right, let???s do it.",Pete
"You know, at the end of the day, it???s really only two days. I mean, I???ll be back in the office. ??If you need me for an emergency, call me. ??I???ll be there...",Jim
"You know what? I don???t know where the years went. ?????Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don???t even recognize them.",Phyllis
Tell me about it.,Jim
Whose hands are these? [holding out her hands to Jim] Theyre not my hands. I don???t know.,Phyllis
All right. You know what? ??Maybe we???ll just... We???ll go slow.,Jim
No. Jim... [wine bottle clangs on plate],Phyllis
All right. Check it out.,Pete
[cheers and applause],Everyone
Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh!,Pete
"Nice. ??Pretty soon, we???re gonna be at the ceiling.",Kevin
Whoo!,Erin
Can you hand me a card?,Pete
"Um,. it???s empty.",Erin
What?,Pete
"Oh, come on. We could use a blank card.",Nellie
No!!,Everyone
That???s cheating.,Meredith
I could get us a complaint.,Pam
You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn???t fart on a butterfly.,Meredith
"No, I wouldn???t. I can???t even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I???d like to try.",Pam
"Hmm. Yeah. ??All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam...",Nellie
[chanting] ???Pam!???,Everyone
What? Why did you call me out here?,Angela
"The target-- it???s Oscar, isn???t it? He and the senator are gaying each other.",Dwight
I don???t know what you???re talking about.,Angela
"Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you???re engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.",Dwight
Fine! It???s Oscar. So what?,Angela
"Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger???s knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?",Dwight
"Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.",Angela
I can???t even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.,Dwight
"Well, you might be right. But it???s too late now.",Angela
What do you mean?,Dwight
He???s here.,Angela
"No! No, no! [groans]",Dwight
"Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.",Dwight
What?,Oscar
Come -- come with me.,Dwight
What are you doing?,Oscar
"There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They???re extraordinary.",Dwight
Yahtzee.,Meredith
Sandwich delivery for Mr. Oscar Martinez.,Trevor
I am Oscar Martinez.,Kevin
"No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside.",Angela
Wha-- wh--,Kevin
"You know, there???s doughnuts in the break room.",Angela
Nice! Yeah.,Kevin
"Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.",Jim
Don???t be pushy Jim. It???s tacky.,Stanley
"All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that???s-- that???s decorative.",Jim
"No, there???s wine in here.",Phyllis
Still decorative.,Jim
Is it white wine?,Stanley
No.,Jim
[to customer] Can you help me?,Phyllis
Don???t-- don???t-- don???t pole people with knives.,Jim
[groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha!,Phyllis
Phyllis! ??Wow.,Jim
"Ooh, bring it over.",Stanley
Got it.,Phyllis
"There???s no time to explain. [descending stairs] Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.",Dwight
"Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?",Oscar
"What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who???s the father of her child?",Dwight
I don???t know what you???re talking about.,Oscar
"Oh, don???t lie. I???m trying to save those precious knees you???re always bragging about. ??Now, let???s get out of here. He could be right behind us.",Dwight
"Aah! Actually, he???s right in front of us.",Dwight
"Let???s get it on. I???m gonna do this. I might-- I might puke, but I???m gonna do this.",Trevor
"No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He???s a Dunder-Mifflin man. He???s my tribe.",Dwight
"I???m sorry, Dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, I???m gonna follow through on something, all right? I have masculinity issues-- Stop! No!",Trevor
I got it.,Oscar
Disarm!,Dwight
You don???t-- [all three grunting],Trevor
Don???t move. And disarm now! [Oscar gets weapon away from others],Dwight
"Okay, okay, okay, okay.",Trevor
"No! No, Oscar. He???s a friend. He???s a friend.",Dwight
"Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They???re family-owned, but don???t let that take away from your edge!",Erin
"Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you.",Nellie
"Remember, you???re a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this.",Creed
"[into phone] Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I???m calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, ???Hey, kool-aid.??? Yeah, your mama???s fat. This is Pam Halpert.",Pam
Did she buy it?,Pete
"Basically I couldn???t tell, but I think...",Pam
Were they angry?,Nellie
I-- I thought they were confused at least...,Pam
Okay.,Nellie
"Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. [hangs up] Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!",Erin
[cheering],Everyone
Nice. Nice.,Kevin
You did good. You did good.,Creed
"See ya later, Heymont.",Pete
No.,Dwight
"If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me I will bite so hard. Got it? Good-bye, my friend.",Trevor
"What the hell, Dwight?",Oscar
"See ya later, Trevor.",Dwight
you are incorrigible!,Oscar
I just saved your life. You???re welcome!,Dwight
You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!,Oscar
You deserved every bit of it! ??You made my husband gay.,Angela
"What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!",Oscar
No. No.,Angela
"Angela, until you face that, you???re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won???t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.",Oscar
Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.,Angela
"Angela, it???s a lead freaking pipe.",Oscar
God! [kicks Oscar],Angela
Aah!,Oscar
You were supposed to be my friend.,Angela
I???m so sorry. Angela--,Oscar
Oscar.,Dwight
Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert...,Pete
[cheers and applause],Everyone
For insulting a client???s recently deceased mother.,Pete
Yes!,Nellie
I did not know that.,Pam
"Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life.",Pete
I???m so sorry.,Pam
Wow.,Meredith
yeah. That???s-- that is terrible.,Pete
[cheers and applause as Pete puts last card on tower],Everyone
You did it.,Kevin
Yeah!,Erin
I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.,Angela
You???re not stupid. Jazz is stupid.,Dwight
"[crying] Jazz is stupid! ??I mean, just play the right notes!",Angela
"I know. You???re gonna be okay, Monkey.",Dwight
I don???t like your friend Trevor.,Angela
I don???t like him either. ??And yet I really like him.,Dwight
"Well, we???re here. Perfect. ??[covers sleeping Phyllis with his jacket]",Jim
"We???re gonna cover for you, ya know.",Phyllis
[chuckles],Stanley
"Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--",Jim
"[laughing] I did enjoy grinding your beans, son.",Stanley
"[laughing] Yeah, we really did peel your grapes.",Phyllis
"This is hilarious, but we???re gonna stop with all--",Jim
Shuckin??? your peas.,Stanley
"Shuckin??? the peas. ??You should go back to the first part, though. You are ??gonna ??cover for me?",Jim
Yeah.,Stanley
"Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.",Phyllis
"Oh, my God, thank you. [hugging both] Thank you.",Jim
"If you???re an artist, you have to be okay with the idea ??that you can???t please everybody all the time.",Pam
You paint very bad--,Hide
"Shut up, Hide! ??I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I???m okay with that.",Pam
Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?,Dwight
That is-- that is a loaded question.,Toby
My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.,Angela
He said that?,Toby
"Well, he didn???t fight me hard on it.",Angela
"I-- I don???t know if there???s truth to-- to, uh, to that.",Toby
What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?,Angela
Oh... uh...,Toby
Is it called red-vining?,Angela
Is it called red-vining?,Dwight
I don???t...,Toby
We heard it was called red-vining.,Dwight
People red vine.,Angela
Where are gay mens??? vaginas?,Dwight
They don???t have vaginas.,Toby
What?,Dwight
No. They???re just regular men.,Toby
"When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person???s penis?",Dwight
Uh... wow....,Toby
[Sighs] I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.,Jim
I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt.,Pam
"Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?",Jim
"I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.",Jim
"Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever.",Dwight
"So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word 'Philadelphia'?",Jim
"Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning 'Love,' and adelph, meaning 'Adolf.' 'the city that loves Adolf.' Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.",Dwight
"Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!",Erin
No.,Angela
Is It?,Nellie
"I mean, it says 'X-Mas party,' but I think we all know what that's code for.",Erin
"So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?",Kevin
"Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee.",Angela
"Well, you are the one in charge of it.",Kevin
Don't blame me for something we all forgot.,Angela
"Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.",Oscar
"I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.",Oscar
"I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.",Phyllis
"[Scoffs] We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!",Meredith
"Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes?",Nellie
"Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?",Kevin
"What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel.",Dwight
"Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?",Jim
No.,Kevin
No!,Angela
"Done, right?",Jim
No.,Angela
No. I want Tropical Christmas.,Stanley
Topless Christmas.,Meredith
Tapas swiss miss.,Creed
"Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa--What's so hard to understand?",Creed
"Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.",Dwight
We already said no.,Phyllis
"No, no, no.",Angela
Too weird.,Nellie
"[Holds up a picture] This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style.",Dwight
"I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?",Jim
"[Blows a weak whistle] Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.",Angela
I'm on it.,Pam
Right.,Jim
I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses.,Pete
"Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.",Erin
Die hard reference.,Pete
I haven't seen it.,Erin
You haven't seen die hard?,Pete
Mm-Mmm.,Erin
Why haven't you seen die hard?,Pete
"I don't know, I just haven't.",Erin
"Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.",Kevin
No.,Erin
"now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho.'",Kevin
"Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs.'",Pete
None of this makes any sense to me!,Erin
"Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, 'Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--'",Kevin
"Actually, he doesn't say that there. He says it earlier when he's on the radio with Hans.",Pete
"Yes, you are right. Forgive me.",Kevin
"Oh, that's okay, bud.",Pete
Nope. [Kevin walks out the door into the kitchen],Kevin
Common mistake.,Pete
"No, it's not.",Kevin
[Points and Pete] Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?,Erin
"My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it.",Pete
"Okay, let's hear it.",Erin
Hear what?,Pete
Die hard. Every line. Go.,Erin
"You don't like flying, do you?'",Pete
Don't change the subject.,Erin
"No, that's the--",Pete
Movie is starting.,Erin
[In Kitchen] We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.,Jim
I love Philly. Dirty town.,Stanley
"[Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim's shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.",Darryl
Whoo!,Jim
So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?,Darryl
"Yeah, I think so.",Jim
Think that through for a sec.,Darryl
"Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?",Darryl
What else could you possibly be forgetting?,Darryl
Uh--,Jim
Things? People?,Darryl
"You know who's not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he's in prison [Jim and Daryl walk out of the kitchen] for something he may not have done.",Toby
"I'm sorry, the--Uh, the Scranton who?",Nellie
The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven't I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago?,Toby
"[Gasps] Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand.",Nellie
I--I could--I could talk about it.,Toby
[Pats Nellie on the shoulder as he's walking by her] See you next Christmas.,Stanley
"I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back.",Toby
"We're the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight's party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's going to be great. And if it's great...I think we all know what that would mean to us.",Pam
Let's do it!,Phyllis
Yes! Phyllis!,Pam
No. I don't want my name attached to this party.,Angela
What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?,Pam
Please just take my name off of everything.,Angela
Just take her name off of everything.,Oscar
"[Clears her throat] The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas.",Pam
Yes! Yeah! [High Fives Jim] Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle! [High Fives Pam] Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!,Dwight
"Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.",Pam
Uh-huh.,Dwight
And that is...,Pam
"Uh, Oh.",Dwight
That there are no rules.,Pam
You have never been cooler.,Dwight
Best Christmas ever.,Jim
You're welcome.,Pam
Thank you.,Jim
[Plays a trumpet] And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.,Dwight
"Ugh. What is this stuff, lava?",Meredith
"That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.",Dwight
What is it? [Jim lifts the hog maw with a fork] Don't touch it.,Pam
[Comes running up at startles Pam] Somebody's found the hog maw.,Dwight
Oh!,Pam
"What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it.",Dwight
Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat.,Stanley
"It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.",Dwight
Can't wait.,Jim
Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine?,Meredith
"This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.",Dwight
How would anyone even know--,Oscar
Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook?,Dwight
I don't know. Is it what you expected?,Jim
I feel like [Pam look's out the window and camera pans out in The Office]--Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.,Pam
So happy right now.,Jim
"[Speaking German] Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. [Blows out the candle] Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump.",Dwight
I wish my car had a bathroom.,Kevin
Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. After that--',Pete
"[On a computer, checking the script] Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete.",Erin
That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes.,Pete
"I don't know. This looks pretty legit. [Erin's cell phone chimes] Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.",Erin
"[Reading the email from Andy] 'What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates.'",Erin
Hey. Everything okay?,Pete
So what comes next?,Erin
"Right, um, okay. So he says, uh, [Pete stands up] 'After we call the police, they'll waste hours trying to negotiate--'",Pete
We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.,Erin
"Or we can just sit and talk, though.",Pete
No. No more talking. It's movie time.,Erin
"I mean, are you sure...Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car.",Pete
"Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan.",Erin
Okay.,Pete
[To Nellie in the kitchen] Here's the thing about moonlight. It's not sunlight.,Toby
[With his mouth full] I love this hog mama.,Kevin
Dwight said it's 'Hog maw.',Phyllis
[Chokes and spits it out] What is maw?!,Kevin
It's the lining of the stomach of--,Phyllis
"[Cackling] Ohh...[In a German Accent] Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!",Dwight
"Yes, he is finally nigh.",Jim
I am nigh!,Dwight
"Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.",Dwight
"Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! [Runs over to Stanley and points at his stomach with a stick] Ohh...Too much strudel.",Dwight
"So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.",Jim
"No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.",Dwight
Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.,Jim
And the fear.,Pam
"Yes, exactly!",Dwight
"Come on, Dwight, you're making this up.",Phyllis
No.,Dwight
"[Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. 'Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany.'",Oscar
Huh.,Angela
Wow.,Pam
"Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?",Dwight
"[Continues reading] 'His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface.'",Oscar
"Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No.",Stanley
"Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys. [Texts warehouse worker, Nate, to forget showing up as zwarte piet]",Dwight
"Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn't that crazy?",Pete
Mm. [Chuckles],Erin
"[Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It's awful.",Darryl
Take a bowl and pass it down.,Dwight
"Thank you, Dwight. These are nice.",Phyllis
"No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.",Dwight
"Oh, it's like naughty or nice.",Jim
"No, impish or admirable.",Dwight
"Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?",Jim
I decided earlier.,Dwight
"Oh, nice. Did you check that list?",Jim
Of course I checked it.,Dwight
But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.,Jim
I checked it more than once.,Dwight
"Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--",Jim
Impish or admirable.,Dwight
Damn.,Jim
Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable. [Jim claps] There you are.,Dwight
[Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these?,Phyllis
It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.,Dwight
I'd rather have the bowl.,Phyllis
"You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year [looks over at Angela, then back to Oscar]...as impish! [Smacks Oscar with a stick]",Dwight
Ow! You hit people with that thing?,Oscar
"No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder [puts a mouse trap in Pam's bowl]",Dwight
Ooh.,Jim
[Holds the mouse trap up] Mouse trap.,Pam
"In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.",Dwight
"Oh, you know what? I gotta go.",Jim
Stop giggling.,Dwight
"Oh, really? Already?",Pam
"Yeah, it's all right.",Jim
"It's a punishment. [Turns to Jim] Hey, where are you going?",Dwight
I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.,Jim
But you work tomorrow.,Dwight
"Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.",Jim
But we were gonna break the pig rib.,Dwight
Ooh.,Jim
Remember?,Dwight
That's right.,Jim
No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you!,Dwight
"Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody.",Jim
"Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present?",Dwight
You know what? Yeah. Have at it.,Jim
Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! [Jim holds his hands like a bowl] I judge your year as impish. [Hits Jim with stick],Dwight
Ooh! Are you nuts?,Jim
[Hits Jim three more times] I judge you impish!,Dwight
"Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.",Jim
They're not abandoning the party. [Hit's Jim again],Dwight
Just--Just--Hey!,Jim
"[As he's walking out] That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!",Jim
[Hits Jim some more] Impish! [Chases Jim out],Dwight
Aah! Ow!,Jim
"Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. [Leans up against the wall as Dwight comes back in]",Meredith
"[In the parking lot, holding his side, walking to the taxi, Pam follows] Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. [To taxi driver] One second. Oh...",Jim
Well...this is it.,Pam
I'm probably never gonna see you again.,Jim
Shut up. I'm trying to be serious.,Pam
"Okay, sorry, sorry.",Jim
I can't believe this is actually happening.,Pam
"Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.",Jim
Okay. [Jim and Pam hug] Good luck. You're gonna be great.,Pam
I'll call you when I get in.,Jim
Okay.,Pam
All right.,Jim
Love you.,Pam
Love you.,Jim
What's going on?,Pam
"Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. [To camera] And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight! [Takes off hat and beard]",Dwight
"We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.",Phyllis
Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it!,Angela
"Oh, it sounds like the party's starting up out there.",Nellie
"Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting.",Toby
"Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.",Darryl
[At Meredtith] Boo!,Darryl
"For what it's worth, I liked your party better.",Pam
"Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.",Dwight
I don't think anyone thought that.,Pam
Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.,Dwight
"Well, that didn't have anything to do with you.",Pam
I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.,Dwight
Zero.,Pam
Damn It!,Dwight
I'm gonna tell Jim to go [Bleep] himself.,Darryl
Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?,Erin
"Yeah. Definitely. [Erin starts to cry] Hey, what's--Oh, no, come here. [Starts to put his arm around Erin] Hey, hey. Come on, huh?",Pete
[Sliding away from Pete] I'm still Andy's girlfriend.,Erin
"Oh, yeah, of course. I know.",Pete
But you can leave your arm.,Erin
"Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?",Pam
"No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.",Dwight
"[Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.",Jim
Jim!,Pam
What's going on? Where's the belsnickel?,Jim
Oh--Oh my god!,Pam
"What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.",Jim
[Holds his finger to Jim's lips] Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash! [High fives Jim],Dwight
What happened? Did you miss your bus?,Pam
No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss],Jim
"[Comes back in, holding up the pig rib] I found it!",Dwight
And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.,Jim
"Oh! [Pig rib breaks and Jim wins, and stuff splatters people. Everyone groans] Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.",Dwight
"[To himself] Back for more, huh? [Gets up and walks towards Jim]",Darryl
"Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?",Jim
You!,Darryl
"Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.",Jim
[Looking at Jim confused] That's great.,Darryl
Right?,Jim
"Thanks, man.",Darryl
"Hey, of course.",Jim
I shall come by at your convenience.,Darryl
"Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl]",Jim
"[Claps his hands once, spins around] Whoo!",Darryl
Go get 'em.,Jim
[Falls backwards onto the food table] Oh! Whoa!,Darryl
Very impish.,Dwight
"Two dimes, seven nickels--Well, okay, no, that doesn't add up. It was one quarter and--",Toby
Shh. [Puts her finger to Toby's lips],Nellie
What? I was just explaining--,Toby
Shh.,Nellie
Why wouldn't it--,Toby
[Put her finger to his lips again] Shh.,Nellie
But why?,Toby
No...more...talking.,Nellie
Are you gonna kiss me?,Toby
Yes. [Kisses Toby],Nellie
"To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.",Kevin
I think they're going to the conference finals.,Jim
No.,Kevin
"Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-... [Jim bites his lip]",Jim
I bit my lip at lunch today.,Jim
"Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough.",Darryl
"Oh, the Nets are super tough. [Jim in pain from his lip]",Kevin
Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.,Jim
The Hawks are terrible. They're always terrible.,Kevin
"Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table]",Jim
"Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen...[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!",Jim
"Good morning, Meredith.",Erin
What?,Pam
"Oh, sorry, Pam. Yikes.",Erin
"Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family.",Pam
"I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.",Jim
[talking on phone] You sound tired. Everything ok?,Jim
Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?,Pam
"Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?",Jim
"Jim, limo's here.",Worker
"Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.",Jim
"Oh, call me later!",Pam
Ok,Jim
Good luck!,Pam
Thanks!,Jim
Love you.,Pam
Love you too. Bye.,Jim
How you doing?,Val
"Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so...",Darryl
It's how it has to be.,Val
"I know, I know. It's just hard.",Darryl
"Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, 'What are you gonna do, breakup with me?' Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.",Darryl
"I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it.",Darryl
"Me neither. Come here. [she hugs Darryl, and Darryl smiles behind her back]",Val
"Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today.",Pam
Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you.,Meredith
He didn't leave me. He just went part time. [Meredith scratches her head vigorously] Can you just fill out the form please?,Pam
Yes.,Meredith
"I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens.",Pam
Hurry up already.,Meredith
"[checking Meredith's head] Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.",Erin
"Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!",Erin
"Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?",Angela
"What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.",Dwight
"Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly.",Pam
Just lice Pam?,Dwight
"Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.",Dwight
"Make way, nope, inspect me.",Dwight
"Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear.",Erin
Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning. [Dwight starts spraying everyone with disinfectant],Dwight
Stop that!,Pam
Dwight!,Angela
Next!,Erin
"[getting her head checked] Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.",Angela
"Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault.",Pam
"Pam, really? Come on.",Oscar
"Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen.",Meredith
Lice. More lice. [Angela shrieks in disgust] Angela has lice.,Erin
Ew! Oh.,Angela
"[checking Stanley's head] Ooh yabber, lice!",Erin
"[checking Pam's head] Yikers, lice.",Erin
No! How? I'm so clean!,Pam
"[checking Oscar's head] Oh yeah, big time lice.",Erin
"I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.",Oscar
What are you wearing?,Phyllis
"It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? [Phyllis, Kevin, Darryl. and Nellie raise their hands] Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?",Dwight
No.,Nellie
No.,Kevin
"Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.",Dwight
"Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.",Darryl
You got dumped?,Phyllis
"Yeah, she ended things.",Darryl
"Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink.",Nellie
Here man. [Kevin hands Daryll some chocolate] You need that more than me.,Kevin
"Thanks, man.",Darryl
Yeah [kisses Darryl on the cheek],Kevin
"Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her.",Pam
"Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.",Angela
That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day.,Stanley
No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house! [Erin jumps on Stanley's back],Erin
Get off me!,Stanley
I'm trying to save you from yourself!,Erin
"Alright, I'll stay! There's a pencil broken in my rolls.",Stanley
"Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me.",Pam
"Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?",Jim
"Yeah, take some home if you want.",Limo Driver
"Oh no, no, no. That's ok. [Jim shoves some snacks in his pocket as he gets out of limo] Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?",Jim
"No, Mr. Irving called. Said he'd rather meet you at his private court.",Limo Driver
You gotta be kidding me.,Jim
"Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something.",Pam
"[shaving her own head] Yes, Pam what do you want?",Meredith
"Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?",Pam
"Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice.",Meredith
Oh stop! I am so sorry!,Pam
"Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?",Meredith
Nothing.,Pam
"I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time. I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this.",Pam
"Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!",Dwight
"No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats...",Erin
To be burned!,Dwight
To be washed.,Erin
What do we do about our heads?,Angela
I'm not gonna lie. Lye!,Dwight
"No, all we need is mayonnaise.",Erin
Excuse me?,Angela
"She's right, it works. I would imagine.",Pam
"Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.",Erin
"I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.",Oscar
[walks in conference room] Shaboom! How do you like me now!?,Meredith
Oh.,Angela
Wow.,Oscar
Take a picture. It will last longer.,Meredith
We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.,Angela
Bald people make me sick.,Creed
"Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss.",Meredith
"Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.",Erin
"Oh! Uh, uh I'll go.",Pam
"Okay. Oh, thank you.",Angela
"You're a saint, Pam.",Oscar
"No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?",Pam
Thanks Pam! I'll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools.,Meredith
Okay.,Pam
"Let's talk pubes, people.",Dwight
"Hey, Darryl.",Val
"Oh, hey Val.",Darryl
"Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn't look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other.",Nellie
Yeah.,Darryl
"What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?",Phyllis
"When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.",Darryl
"Aw, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this.",Nellie
"I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.",Kevin
"Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake.",Phyllis
"Listen, let's try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most.",Nellie
An Escalade.,Kevin
Or what's her name.,Nellie
Val.,Phyllis
Let's get Darryl Val.,Nellie
I hope you don't mind me bringing you out here. I can't get my knees under a desk.,Julius Irving
Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.,Jim
"Well, do you think you can sink one from deep?",Julius
"Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.",Jim
"Okay. [Jim shoots the basket and it goes in] Wow, Halpert's got game.",Julius
"Alright. [Jim's phone rings] Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?",Jim
It's your wife? You better take it.,Julius
"Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what's up? Everything ok?",Jim
"Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.",Pam
"It's still happening right now actually, so uh...",Jim
"He's really making you work for it, huh?",Pam
"Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?",Jim
"Great. I am killing it over here. [drops mayonnaise on the ground] Jim, I gotta go.",Pam
"Okay, bye. [Jim turns back to Julius] So sorry about that.",Jim
"No problem. Hey Jim, what size do you wear, man? I got a pair of japanese Nikes with your name on them. What do you think?",Julius
I love it.,Jim
"[handing out mayonnaise jars] Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.",Erin
"Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right. [Dwight holds up a pair of scissors]",Dwight
Put those away before you hurt yourself.,Stanley
"[swings the scissors around and puts them into his pocket, putting a hole in his Hazmat suit] Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!",Dwight
"Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.",Erin
"Oscar, do you want to be my partner?",Angela
"Yeah, yeah, sure. I'd love to..",Oscar
"Hey, uh, mayo buddy, five dollar tip, you unclog my ears. Okay?",Creed
"Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?",Erin
"Uh, yeah. We promised each other if we ever got lice, we'd buddy up. Sorry, man.",Pete
"Hey, Creed, wanna be my buddy?",Pam
Oh God. Stuck with the weirdo.,Creed
[Angela is slapping mayo on Oscar's head] Angela.,Oscar
You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?,Angela
[putting mayo on Stanley's head] You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more.,Meredith
"[putting mayo on Creed's head] Creed, I'm all done. My turn.",Pam
"I'm sorry, Pam. It looks a little messy.",Creed
"Well, wait.",Pam
[putting mayo on Erin's head] How's that?,Pete
I feel it working. [Erin and Pete playing around with the mayo] Eiffel tower!,Erin
Can I help you?,Val
"Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.",Phyllis
"Yeah, that's true.",Val
"We think you made a big, big mistake.",Phyllis
Big mistake.,Kevin
Quite enormous.,Nellie
He's a real catch and you should take him back.,Phyllis
"Ok, thank you. Is that all?",Val
"No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you?",Nellie
"Thank you all for your concern, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, okay?",Val
So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back?,Kevin
No.,Val
"Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever.",Kevin
"Yeah, Kevin asked me out. I was kinda feeling good about reentering the dating pool, but then Kevin asked me out. Thought I might trade up to a new level of man. Then Kevin asked me out.",Val
[phone rings] Hello?,Pam
"[on speaker phone] Hi, honey, it's mom. Look, Cece's school just called. She still has lice.",Helene
"What, no. That can't...I don't...",Pam
"Now, don't worry, don't worry. I'm on my way to pick her up, but you might have lice too. You know, lice can be tricky. Sometimes lice, like...[Pam hangs up phone]",Helene
Oh my God.,Angela
Shave her head. Shave her head!,Meredith
"[everyone yelling at Pam]You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that...",Pam
"Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.",Meredith
[talking through the loud speaker] She's right Pam.,Dwight
Is there a volume knob on that thing?,Pam
Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.,Dwight
"Meredith, I am so sorry.",Pam
"Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster.",Angela
I meant to say something earlier. I just...,Pam
Just? Just what? Just forgot?,Meredith
"Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam.",Meredith
"Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as...[Dwight drops the grenade and it goes off inside Andy's office]",Dwight
"Dwight, are you okay!?",Erin
"Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple. [Dwight collapses]",Dwight
Wow. He got to purple.,Erin
"[Angela rinsing Oscar's hair, and she bumps his head] Ow!",Oscar
Sorry.,Angela
You're waterboarding me!,Oscar
Oops.,Angela
"[shoving large amounts of bubble wrap into the baler, as a warehouse worker passes] No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.",Kevin
You're up.,Erin
"Yeah, I'm kinda sad to see this baby go.",Pete
"You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.",Erin
Okay.,Pete
Okay. Okay. [rinsing Pete's hair out] Is that too cold?,Erin
"No, it actually feels kinda nice.",Pete
"I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time. [as the baler crushes the bubble wrap, making loud noises]",Kevin
Okay.,Val
Huh?,Darryl
Let's give it a shot. Let's make it work.,Val
"Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do.",Darryl
You're not. I believe in us.,Val
But... [Val kisses Darryl],Darryl
I'm back together with Val. Yay...,Darryl
"I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. [Dwight gets into his car and another insecticidal grenade goes off]",Dwight
"Hey, did Erin already take off?",Pete
I guess so.,Oscar
Okay.,Pete
"You're Kareem, coming to help.",Julius
"Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.",Jim
And it went like this. [Jim's phone starts ringing],Julius
And that's all?,Jim
That's it.,Julius
"No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.",Jim
"Yeah, you show me how.",Julius
"[Jim's phone goes to voicemail] This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.",Jim
"Hey honey, it's me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you.",Pam
"Hey, what you doing right now?",Meredith
I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day.,Pam
Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer.,Meredith
Really? A beer sounds incredible right now.,Pam
No duh. Let's go. You're buying.,Meredith
"Meredith, I am so sorry about today.",Pam
Forget about it.,Meredith
"I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.",Pam
Right. I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over.,Meredith
"Get it, girl!",Pam
[Pam and Meredith singing karaoke] This one's for all you ladies out there.,Pam
[starts singing] I come...,Meredith
Not yet.,Pam
"[singing] I come home in the middle of the night. My mother says when you gonna live your life right? Oh Mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones. And girls, they want to have fun. Oh girls just want to have fun.",Both
Stone & Son Suit Warehouse contract expired with their paper provider! Go get it! ???David Wallace,New Instant Message
"Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They???re a family owned business [chuckles]. Jim and I used to clean up at those. We???d go in pretending to be family ??? brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store. Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew.",Dwight
"[on phone with Jim] I hope you???ve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it???s time for another episode of ???Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire???.",Dwight
"Sorry, Stinky, can???t do it. Too busy.",Jim
"Oh, god, this again? You???re Stinky.",Dwight
"Okay. There???s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.",Jim
"Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.",Dwight
"I have ears, Dwight.",Phyllis
"Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. [back to Jim] See what you leave me with here, Jim?",Dwight
"Hey, I???m in Philadelphia right now.",Jim
How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.,Dwight
Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?,Jim
"Mmm. That???s a good??? question. 300 times??? [Jim hangs up] 180??? Um that comes to 25 minutes. [realizes Jim hung up] Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.",Dwight
"Darryl, looking good!",Nellie
Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim???s company.,Darryl
"Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?",Pam
Why don???t you come along and tell him yourself?,Darryl
"Ha ha. That???d be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get??? What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn???t I think of this? Andy???s not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I???m expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?",Pam
"Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.",Erin
"A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything???s in order.",Pam
"What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it???s in order? I [laughs] haven???t been trained for this.",Erin
"[giggles] Okay, see you later.",Pam
Hey guys.,Clark
Clark!,Phyllis
Hey!,Meredith
"Hey, look who???s back, Dwight Junior.",Oscar
"Hey, so how was it? I mean??? the sex with Jan.",Kevin
A gentleman doesn???t discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved.,Clark
Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week. I mean it was??? like making love with a wild animal. But not like a cougar like you might think. It was uh??? like a swarm of bees. Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room.,Clark
"Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, ???Talk classy, act nasty???.",Meredith
What???s with the wig Meredith?,Clark
"What, is it on backwards? [partially removes wig, revealing her bald head]",Meredith
"Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. It???s an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast so??? bon appetite.",Clark
Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that???s Italian.,Phyllis
My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.,Oscar
Always with the friends Oscar. Can???t we just enjoy the new espresso machine?,Meredith
"Actually, it???s pronounced ???espresso?????? Wait. That???s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So???",Oscar
"There he is! [chuckles] We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but???",Dwight
"If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.",Clark
"Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh??? No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?",Dwight
[sarcastically chuckling] I loved it.,Clark
How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?,Dwight
"If it???ll lead to me being a salesman, I???ll pretend to be your friend.",Clark
Then looks like we have a deal??? Son [holds up a suit identical to his],Dwight
Hi guys!,Erin
"Hey, look who it is!",Pete
"Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.",Erin
Try this one. [handing Erin a cup of espresso],Oscar
Thank you! [leaves the room],Erin
"I don???t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone???s trust. About the pens.",Erin
You ready for your interview?,Pam
"I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy???s job in the bag until my interview.",Darryl
"Well, you shouldn???t be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.",Pam
"Yeah, I guess???",Darryl
"Really, you can???t be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he???s basically Gumby with hair. [Darryl laughs]",Pam
"[chuckling] It???s kind of funny, a father and son sales team meeting with a father and son suit store.",Suit Store Father
"You know, you???re right! We hadn???t even thought of that, had we boy? [to Clark]",Dwight
"No, we sure hadn???t Pop. [both chuckling]",Clark
"[Takes picture from desk] Oh! You???re a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? [grabs Clark???s shoulder]",Dwight
He calls me Clarky ???cause he???s my Dad.,Clark
Guilty!,Dwight
You don???t meet many hunters these days.,Suit Store Father
"My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he???s like a serial killer??? of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick! [Dwight imitates sawing and blood spurting out of his neck, then makes a dying noise]",Clark
"It was his birthday, just turned three. So???",Dwight
Ahh???,Suit Store Father
"You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?",Oscar
"No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder?",Nellie
Taste test? I???m in!,Kevin
YOLO! [singing and dancing],Oscar
What? [everyone is confused],Phyllis
It???s a thing. It means ???you only live once???.,Oscar
"Yeah, we???re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.",Kevin
Well???,Oscar
"Alright everybody, who???s in? [everyone except Angela puts their hand in the middle of the group, like a huddle] Angela? [Angela shakes her head] Don???t make us come over there.",Kevin
"No, I don???t??? no.",Angela
"Alright, let???s go. [starts shuffling the whole group towards Angela]",Kevin
Can???t I just agree without putting my hand in?,Angela
Absolutely not!,Nellie
No way.,Kevin
"Oh, fine. [puts a napkin on top of everyone else???s hands and reluctantly puts her own hand on the napkin]",Angela
"Ok guys, ???we all drink them all???.",Kevin
"[Meredith, Phyllis, Nellie, Angela, Creed, Oscar, Stanley] We all drink them all!",Everyone

Yes!,Oscar
Whoo!,Nellie
"Hey, where???s my ring?",Phyllis
I???m sure it???ll turn up.,Creed
"[in the background] Yes ma???am, you want to go east on Franklin, take that all the way to Commonweath. You???ll see us on the right side, you can???t miss us.",Athlead Employee
???And I want to reach every demographic possible.,Dennis
"No, I hear what you???re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?",Jim
"We???re talking weeks here, not months, right?",Dennis
"Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.",Jim
Alright. Good.,Dennis
"Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. [To Pam] Hey! How are you?",Jim
Good!,Pam
What are you doing here?,Jim
I just wanted to see you!,Pam
That???s so great!,Jim
"Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!",Darryl
"It???s pretty great, right? I mean, we???re coming along??? [to coworker] Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis???s timeline",Jim
Okay,Wade
"[back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.",Jim
"???But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark???s getting out of my car. He???s a good boy, does whatever I say.",Dwight
"[sighs] I can???t relate to that, my son hates my guts.",Suit Store Father
Oh??? really.,Dwight
"Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that?",Suit Store Father
"[fumbling] Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they???re not even good. Really, they???re bad. Like you and your son.",Dwight
"[enters] Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but??? God I missed you!",Clark
"What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?",Dwight
"[confused] I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.",Clark
You???re being disrespectful!,Dwight
"???And I love you, for saying that.",Clark
[whispers to Clark] We don???t get along.,Dwight
[catches on] Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is??? our relationship is??? terr-,Clark
Terrible!,Dwight
Terrible.,Clark
"Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!",Dwight
"Wow, this place is??? so great. I had no idea ??? on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.",Pam
"Well, I mean, I don???t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so??? These things go down all the time.",Jim
"If this company???s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.",Darryl
[to Pam] Are you cool to just hang out?,Jim
"Sure, no problem.",Pam
Yeah? [to Darryl] You ready?,Jim
Yeah.,Darryl
Let???s do it!,Jim
"The pen delivery went amazing, and now I???ve got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I???m not one of those people who???s just like, ???Uh, sure. I???ll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back???s turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand??? they are just sitting here. Pam didn???t tell me not to unpack them. Don???t want to be a busybody, but I don???t want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it???s insane! I???m sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I???ve never had an espresso before. They???re good though.",Erin
A-bam! [slams espresso cup on table] My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I???ve tried so far is Alpine Select!,Nellie
Yes! [giggles and picks up Angela],Kevin
Ugh!,Angela
One! [as he picks Angela up in the air],Kevin
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!,Angela

"So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing.",Clark
I heard that before???,Suit Store Father
"Well, I understand, but ???",Clark
"I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.",Dwight
"Here we go again, another lecture from the old man.",Clark
Listen to him. He created you.,Suit Store Father
"Maybe if you listened a little bit, you???d improve. No wonder women despise you.",Dwight
Women don???t despise me???,Clark
"His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam???s apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn???t see it, or didn???t wanna see it.",Dwight
"Alright, that???s enough, ???cause I can say some things about him too.",Clark
Yeah? Like what?,Dwight
"Like the time that you got drunk and, and then??? Killed those kids on their way to prom!",Clark
That never happened. He???s always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught ???saving treats??? from the kitty litter box.,Dwight
Really shameful???,Suit Store Father
So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-,Clark
Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.,Dwight
"There???s obviously a volume discount uh, if you-",Clark
"Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going ???please kitty, may I have some more???? You can???t make this stuff up!",Dwight

"Here he is, my son.",Suit Store Father

I usually take a siesta about now.,Stanley
"[to Erin] Stocking pens, huh? You???re like the new office administrator.",Pete
"No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it???s the truth, I swear.",Erin
"Pam! Pam, look out! Erin???s gunning for your job!",Kevin
"No, I???m not! [Kevin imitates gunfire] It???s not like that at all! Forget it, I???m so sorry.",Erin
"Pam, look out!",Kevin
"Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you???ve had.",Erin
"By the way, Jim talks about you all the time.",Athlead Employee
That???s sweet that he talks about me.,Pam
It???s too bad he still hast to work part time in Scranton though???,Athlead Employee
"Well, that???s funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia.",Pam
We can???t wait until you move here.,Athlead Employee
"I???m sorry, you guys are here to sell us paper?",Suit Store Son
Do you mind? The men are talking.,Dwight
Sons used to idolize their fathers.,Suit Store Father
Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?,Dwight
"I???d love to! Sam Junior here, he runs the business now. Kind of pushed me out, truth be told. I???m just here for human contract.",Suit Store Father

"They???re the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It???s like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don???t blame Cece.",Pam
So I???m like a three year old girl in this scenario???,Darryl
Say they don???t hire you. It???s not like you???re out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.,Pam
"And I???d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I???m??? I???m not so sure I???d like living in Philadelphia.",Darryl
Right? Thank you! It???s just Philly. Everyone???s acting like it???s New York or Paris or London.,Pam
Who needs it?,Darryl
Not us.,Pam
"[enters] Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They???re going to make you pay for the fish, and??? they wanted to know when you can start.",Jim
What? [Jim shrugs] How about yesterday?,Darryl
Congratulations.,Pam
"Oh, thank you.",Darryl
I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.,Pam
"Yes, I love Philly! Two-One-Five or die!",Darryl
"No, I???m not upset. I???m really excited for Darryl??? Maybe I???m a little disappointed that we???ll be losing him.",Pam

Does that suit come with a fire extinguisher? [Clark chuckles],Suit Store Son
"You know what Dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, I???m going to need one right? If I???m ever going to get a ???real job??? and move my ???lazy ass??? out of your ???G.D. house???.",Clark
He???s got you there???,Suit Store Son
[to Clark in dressing room] That???s Italian silk. Very comfortable. Very tasteful??? Although expensive.,Suit Store Son
"Yeah, you don???t want Italian. You???ll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you???ll be doing life in Rikers Island.",Dwight
"Well, that???s better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.",Clark
"That place doesn???t exist. It???s not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?",Dwight
[emerges from dressing room wearing a sharp black suit] How do I look?,Clark
Actually??? You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I???ll take one too.,Dwight
"Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don???t we move the copier into the annex like we???ve always wanted to?",Oscar
Whoo!,Nellie
Frickin??? A!,Meredith

"Kevin, move. I can???t pull up the rug if you???re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.",Oscar
Well I can???t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.,Kevin
"Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?",Angela

"You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That???s what happened. The pens happened.",Erin
???Are the pens here?,Pam
"Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. ???Scranton Mimeograph Corp???? I don???t think we???re doing business with them any time soon.

"I think I???m a little too busy these days to s--- [whispering] Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.",Jim
The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.,Jim
I don???t get it.,Kevin
Aha! A lightbulb.,Dwight
A lightbul--,Kevin
A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. [holding note over lamp] Invisible ink.,Dwight
Whoa.,Kevin

"So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative?",Nellie
"Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.",Erin
Wow.,Nellie
It???s just Pete in sunglasses.,Erin
Oh.,Nellie
And then we had him ???Like??? Dunder Mifflin.,Erin
"Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them ???Like??? Derek???s ???Likes.???",Pete
"So far, we???re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.",Erin
You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together.,Nellie
All right.,Erin
Pete and I work well together -- not that there???s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I???m into girls. Not that I???m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?,Erin
Hey.,Jim
Hey Jim. Peter Rowley at Bridgeport Capital requested a meeting at lunch.,Co-worker
"Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.",Jim
Uh sure. No problem.,Co-worker #2
"Cece???s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I???ve been working with her on her move. It???s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It???s kind of like this. It???s pretty cute, right?",Jim
"Pfft, ???Athlead???? Please. They???re too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it ???Stumpany,??? for ???Stupid Company.???",Dwight
"Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That???s why I???m doing it.",Darryl
You???re working for ???Stumpany??? too?,Dwight
"Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I???m switching over.",Darryl
What?,Dwight
Yep.,Darryl
"[on phone] Hey, Halpert, what???s the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you???re stealing Darryl too. When will it end?",Dwight
"Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.",Jim
You won???t stop until you???ve poached us all.,Dwight
Yeah. Even you.,Jim
No. I???ll be damned if I???m gonna let us lose me.,Dwight

"I have no information. But I???m sure as soon as they know, they???ll call you.",Angela
"Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I???m just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let???s be realistic.

"Well, I???m heading out to Cece???s dance recital.",Pam
Aw.,Oscar
"Hey, Cece, Daddy???s gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?",Pam
Yeah.,Cece
Let???s call him.,Pam
Hey. I was just about to call you.,Jim
"Hey, Hon, are you close?",Pam
"I am still in Philly, actually.",Jim
What?,Pam
"It???s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I???m stuck here trying to keep him on board.",Jim
"Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren???t gonna make it.",Pam
"Pam, I couldn???t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.",Jim
I want Daddy.,Cece
"You???re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy???s gonna record it. So we???ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?",Jim
Of course.,Pam
Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?,Jim
"Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.",Pam
"Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you???re not the best with the phone.",Jim
"I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we???re getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, ???Bye, Daddy.???",Pam

"No, you go -- okay.",Erin
"All right, all right.Okay, start over.",Pete
"Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man. ?????Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously.??? I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie.",Nellie
"Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.",Dwight
[murmuring],All
You???re welcome.,Dwight
Wait. This says ???Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge????,Phyllis
"This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.",Dwight
???Loyalty pledge????,Oscar
"Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I???m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.",Darryl
"Yeah, we???ll see about that.",Dwight
"Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you???ve got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? ???Infuriating, irresponsible???...",Dwight
"They got us set up with Windows 95, ??so you???re kind of dreaming here.",Clark
"Okay, I???m gonna need you to print it out.",Dwight
[writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it???s an idea. But what does it mean?,Dwight
"Ooh, it???s when you get a free sandwich after you???ve already eaten ten sandwiches.",Kevin
Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.,Dwight
I wouldn???t say a rage.,Mr. Romanko
"Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It???s very unlikely it would happen again.",Darryl
Thank you. Thank you.,Mr. Romanko
"No, you???re not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? ??L--",Dwight
Loyalty.,Darryl
Loyalty.,Dwight
Loyalty is exactly right.,Nellie
Thank you.,Dwight
"Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let???s all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships?",Nellie
That???s none of your damn business.,Stanley
Darryl is ???dating??? Dunder Mifflin.,Nellie
Darryl is dating Val... still.,Darryl
But he???s flirting with Jim???s company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to.,Nellie
I???m sorry. Do I still need to be here?,Mr. Romanko
Yes.,Dwight
"I???m having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let???s-- let???s use an example. Take Erin. Erin???s boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean.",Nellie
Yeah.,Dwight
"So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example?",Nellie
Let???s try it out.,Creed
"No, let???s-- let???s-- let???s not say Creed. Let???s say Mr. X.",Nellie
"Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.",Angela
"Oh, I???m sorry. Didn???t you cheat on Andy?",Erin
Yes. And he didn???t like it.,Angela
"Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?",Phyllis
"Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that???s the guy that Erin???s flirting with?",Kevin
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Little Ladybug Ballerinas.",Dance Teacher

"[whispering] Um, I???m sorry. I have to go. My daughter???s a ladybug. I know that doesn???t make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you.",Pam
You???re very rude.,Parent in audience #2
"Yes, very rude.",Parent in audience #1
Shh! Kids are dancing.,Pam
"Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. [chuckles] So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?",Dwight
"Dwight, look, I???m sorry you???re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.",Darryl
It can???t be more fun than selling paper and paper products.,Dwight
It can.,Darryl
"Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?",Dwight
"Well, Andy???s cute, but he???s too vanilla, whereas Pete - he???s just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.",Phyllis
I???m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven???t done anything.,Erin
"Yeah right. With slammin??? bods like that, they ain???t playing checkers.",Meredith
"People, it???s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?",Oscar
"Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that???s the end of it. Right, Pete?",Erin
"That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from?",Pete
Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis.,Kevin
[groan],All
"Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I???m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.",Erin
"I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah.",Nellie
"Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You???re welcome, Andy. And you???re welcome, my own ass.",Nellie
"Listen, I appreciate you taking the time with me.",Investor
"Peter, please. We completely understand your concerns here. Let us just show you the latest projections. Jim?",Co-worker
"Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he???s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--",Jim
"Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he???ll be calling in any second.",Jim
"[on phone] Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something.",Pam
"Hey boss, you gotta jump on a delivery.",Lonnie
I don???t do that anymore.,Darryl
That???s what they told me.,Lonnie
[sighs],Darryl
"All right, let???s get this over with.",Darryl
You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! [laughs] Here we go! Yeah!,Dwight
"Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!",Dwight
How far is this place? [turns off radio],Darryl
"Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl]",Dwight
Fun.,Darryl
"Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there.",Toby
"Oh, thank you. I don???t know, I sort of thought--",Nellie
"[hugging Nellie] So proud of you, Hon.",Toby
"Oh, I don???t know. Okay.",Nellie
"I???m just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin?",Toby
"Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one.",Nellie
"Pete???s a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat.",Toby
I didn???t really think about it like that.,Nellie
"Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have.",Toby
???What we have????,Nellie
Mm-hmm.,Toby
"I just remembered... I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no.",Nellie
Yes. Fast food. I???ll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.,Dwight
They have fast food in Philly.,Darryl
Not like this.,Dwight
Exactly like this.,Darryl
And your milkshake.,Fast Food Worker
Thank you.,Dwight
It???s 30 degrees out. You drinkin??? a mildshake?,Darryl
"Nope. [throwing milkshake] Fire in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now that???s what working at a paper company???s all about!",Dwight
"Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.",Dwight
You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.,Darryl
"It???s a youtube thing! Let???s go. Let???s go. Come on, they???re coming.",Dwight
Anyone want to see the video from Cece???s recital?,Pam
"Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that [picks up piece of paper].",Angela
I???ll watch it. Let???s get this over with.,Oscar
"All right, you don???t have to.",Pam
"Let???s get this over with, Pam.",Kevin
Okay.,Pam
Oh.,Oscar
Wait. What?,Pam
"[recorded on phone] Excuse me, I have to get back to work.",Pam
"Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.",Pam
User error. I???ve heard of that happening to other people.,Oscar
"Oscar, don???t rub it in. I???m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.",Angela
"Well, it was an important phone call.",Pam
"I haven???t told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he???s always like, ???Beesly!??? I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- ???Beesly!??? [chuckles]",Pam
Hey.,Pete
"Hello, Peter.",Erin
[cleaning up milkshake in restaurant] It barely even feels like a prank anymore.,Dwight
You missed a spot.,Darryl
Fire in the hole! [throwing milkshake] Go! Go! Go! Go! [tires screech],Drive Thru Customer
"Ha ha! Yeah, joke???s on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!",Dwight
I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force.,Nellie
"Oh, no, I really don???t think that???s a good idea.",Erin
"Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it.",Nellie
"Well, okay, then.",Pete
I guess we don???t have a choice.,Erin
Nope.,Nellie
yeah.,Pete
Yeah.,Erin
Lady...you never stop surprising me.,Toby
[sighs],Dwight
[clears throat],Darryl
What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?,Dwight
No. I was clearing my throat.,Darryl
Good night.,Meredith
Night,Pam
Night,Creed
"Night, Creed.",Pam
Hey.,Pam
Hey.,Jim
"So, how???s it going?",Pam
"We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It???s like everything I did, he just wouldn???t go for it.",Jim
I???m so sorry.,Pam
"I have no idea where we???re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.",Jim
"[sighs] Oh, I???m sorry. I feel like you???ve already been working insanely hard.",Pam
Can you figure out how to upload Cece???s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.,Jim
"Um, actually, funny story -- I didn???t get it. I shouldn???t have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.",Pam
"You???re not serious, are you? You didn???t get any of the recital?",Jim
"No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.",Pam
"Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.",Jim
"Yeah, okay, I???m sorry. I???m sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.",Pam
"Oh, great. So we???ll see somebody else???s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it???s really not that hard to film a video.",Jim
Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?,Pam
"Look, Pam, I don???t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It???s gone. That moment???s just gone. I missed it.",Jim
"I don???t know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there.",Pam
"You???re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I???m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You???ve agreed to this.",Jim
You know what? I-- I-- I don???t think you want to start a conversation with me about what???s fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --,Pam
"Pam, I???m not explaining this to you-- Pam, I???m not going over this again.",Jim
Jim. We need you.,Co-worker
"I don???t know how else to tell you, okay? I???m doing everything I can every week to bring home something...",Jim
"I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.",Pam
"I???m doing this just for me? Is that what I???m doing? I???m doing it just for me. If that???s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?",Jim
Yep.,Pam
We???ll talk tomorrow?,Jim
Yep. I???ll talk to you tomorrow.,Pam
Okay. I???ll talk to you tomorrow.,Jim
"Bye. [quietly crying, sniffling]",Pam
"Hey, you okay?",Brian
"What am I doing wrong, Brian?",Pam
Nothing. You???re doing the best you can.,Brian
Brian.,Cameraman
Give her a minute. Give her a minute.,Brian
[crying],Pam
"Hey, it???s just a tough situation, all right?",Brian
It???s getting tougher. I just didn???t know that it was gonna be this hard.,Pam
"Yeah. Let???s turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough.",Brian
Thank you.,Pam
[on video] Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go!,Guy
"[watching you tube video, laughing]",Darryl
"[on video] I nailed that guy, dude. Oh yeah.",Guy
And replay.,Darryl
"[on video] Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go! I nailed that guy, dude. Oh, yeah.",Guy
[sighs] I???m gonna miss the paper business.,Darryl
"Hey Brian, you got a sec?",Pam
"Yeah, hold on a sec.",Brian
I feel awful.,Pam
It???s fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you. [phone rings],Brian
"[in background] Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.",Erin
"Well, thanks for being a good friend.",Pam
"Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away?",Brian
"Yeah, mostly.",Pam
"Pam, phone call.",Erin
"Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa.",Pam
Will do.,Brian
Okay. Thank you.,Pam
Sure.,Brian
"Hey, boom guy.",Meredith
"Oh, hey Meredith.",Brian
When are you gonna boom me?,Meredith
"Uh, listen, they???re cracking down on us talking to the subjects. It???s a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna??? I, I???ll see you later.",Brian
Got it.,Meredith
"Hey, so I hear you???re bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?",Clark
"That???s right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.",Dwight
"Well, uh??? see, you raised it.",Clark
"Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.",Dwight
"Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim???s desk while he???s away in Philly. Finally I???ll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It???s like, ???Really, Jim? You don???t understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.??? Wow.",Dwight
"You know what, man? I deserve this job.",Clark
Mm-hmm.,Dwight
"I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond??? and under.",Clark
"You know what? You???re gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you???re going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.",Dwight
"Clark has no chance. I mean, he???s up against my buddy Rolf, for God???s sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor ??? he???ll make you laugh so hard, you???ll puke your pants.",Dwight
"This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.",Clark
Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.,Dwight
"You could???ve just called that an alliance too, right?",Jim
I chose my words very carefully.,Dwight
"Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that???s only gonna make things worse.",Jim
[sighs] You interviewing for the sales job too?,Clark
No. You???re interviewing for it. I???m getting it.,Rolf
"Well, I wouldn???t be so sure about that. I mean, I???ve been working here 12 weeks. That???s a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we???ve seen.",Clark
I???m Rolf. Rolf Ahl.,Rolf
Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl.,Clark
Go to hell.,Rolf
There he is.,Clark
"Hey. Come on, buddy. Let???s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first. You don???t compare. When you???re with the R-O-L-F, you???re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]",Dwight
Nice.,Rolf
"Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.",Dwight
When are you talking to David Wallace?,Pam
"I???m talking to him this afternoon, but don???t get your hopes up.",Jim
Too late. My hopes are up.,Pam
"Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we???re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix ??? me asking the boss of the company I???m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So??? problem solved. Thanks, guys.",Jim
And this chair???s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!,Dwight
I???m on the phone. I???m on the phone.,Jim
No doy!,Dwight
I???m just gonna call you back. Thanks.,Jim
"I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I don???t do earbuds.",Rolf
[laughs] No earbuds! [both laugh],Dwight
I???m sure he???s just nervous.,Jim
[sighs] It???s fine. It???s just a seating arrangement. Doesn???t matter.,Pam
"So I???ve got your resume here, but it???s not telling me everything.",Dwight
"Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you???re qualified to evaluate me?",Rolf
"Well, I???m the one offering the job.",Dwight
What are your credentials?,Rolf
I???ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I???m an Assistant to the Regional Manager.,Dwight
I think I???ve heard everything I need to hear.,Rolf
"Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I???m sure he???d give a reference.",Dwight
"Thank you, Dwight. I???ll be in touch.",Rolf
"Well, they can???t all be winners. But Trevor???s next and he???s a real professional. You say, ???Jump,??? and he says, ???Oh who???? He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.",Dwight
What makes you think you???d be an effective paper salesman?,Dwight
"Ooh, okay. Didn???t see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it.",Trevor
"Well, it???s a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.",Dwight
Pass. Next one.,Trevor
All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?,Dwight
"No, no and no.",Trevor
There were only two options.,Dwight
"Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking?",Trevor
This is a bus transfer.,Dwight
[chuckles] Nothing gets by this guy.,Trevor
"Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?",Clark
"Sure, yeah, go ahead.",Jim
"Thanks, dude. You???you sure it???s okay? ???Cause you???re kinda???",Clark
"Yeah, absolutely. Do people like sitting next to you? You???re clean, right?",Jim
"Oh, Dove Men.",Clark
"Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don???t listen to it at all because we???re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so???",Jim
"Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this?",Clark
"Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.",Jim
"Thanks, dude.",Clark
Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.,Jim
Why?,Clark
I need you to breathe in my face right now.,Jim
[exhales],Clark
"What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?",Jim
Wintergreen.,Clark
"I knew it, I knew it.",Jim
"Yeah, good nose.",Clark
"I looked at you coming around, and I said, ???Wintergreen.???",Jim
"I can???t hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.",Dwight
"Okay, here???s one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock. You can???t rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.",Dwight
That???s just a classic no-win situation.,Clark
Thank you.,Dwight
So I???d Kobayashi Maru it.,Clark
"Damn it! Perfect answer, again.",Dwight
Yep.,Clark
"Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ???",Dwight
"You know what, Dwight?",Clark
And anoth???,Dwight
"This interview???s over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru???d the whole process.",Clark
No.,Dwight
Yeah. Star Trek rules.,Clark
"It does, but still no.",Dwight
"Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?",Clark
"Oh, you think they???re my only friends? I???ve got way more friends than that, and they???re all better than the losers who work here.",Dwight
This is not natural.,Stanley
Just ??? I don???t wanna make assumptions based on people???s physical appearances.,Oscar
"Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?",Pam
They smell so bad.,Darryl
"If I ever get that bad, you???d tell me, right?",Meredith
"Meredith, I tell you all the time.",Kevin
[chuckles] Walked right into that one.,Meredith
"Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He???s got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I???ve got big expectations, Mose-wise.",Dwight
What quality would make you a good sales associate?,Dwight
People person.,Mose
It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.,Dwight
That???s right.,Mose
"You know we live together, right?",Dwight
Yes.,Mose
"And I???ve never seen you go to work, ever.",Dwight
Okay.,Mose
So why is this on your resume? [door slams],Dwight
So how???d you guys hear about the position?,Clark
My???my mom.,Gabor
"Dwight called my house, but he didn???t realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I can???t stay out of her stuff.",Nate
"Dwight???s my cousin, so I overheard him telling my brother Mose about the job opportunity in the shower.",Zeke
You were in the shower or he was in the shower?,Clark
"Everyone was in the shower. It???s a cow shower, so there???s like, a ton of people in there.",Zeke
So you guys all know Dwight already?,Clark
"I was his babysitter, and then we dated for a while. He was a passionate lover and the sweetest little baby.",Melvina
I knew you looked familiar. You used to pick up Dwight from school.,Gabor
You went to X-Men school too? [exhales],Melvina
X-Men school?,Clark
"When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier???s School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out.",Dwight
"Oh, I have a few powers. Night hearing. Dogs understand where I point. And our training included picking carrots, scrubbing tubs, sewing imitation Levi???s. A lot of telemarketing.",Gabor
I don???t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.,Angela
I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn???t work then. And now look what he???s doing to us.,Stanley
"Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault.",Nellie
How is it my fault?,Jim
"Here???s an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others.",Nellie
But it???s Dwight who???s bring in all the weirdos.,Jim
"Yeah, but Jim, Dwight???s a weirdo. We can???t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.",Oscar
"Hey, I???m the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim???s away. I???m in a position where I???m rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. [sighs] Forget it. I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.",Pam
"[on phone] Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later.",David Wallace
"Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input???",Jim
[presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don???t lie. I can tell if you???re lying.,Dwight
"Hey, Dwight. It???s David.",David Wallace
David.,Dwight
Jim says he???d like some say in the hiring process.,David Wallace
"Really? That???s interesting. ???Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who???s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.",Dwight
"I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife???",Jim
"Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work.",David Wallace
Oh. Um???,Jim
Yeah.,David Wallace
Okay. I can???t say that that???s not fair.,Jim
"Sounds fair to me, David.",Dwight
And I know we have a call scheduled for later ???,David Wallace
"Oh, yeah, so we???ll just do that later.",Jim
No. Why not do it now?,Dwight
Yeah. What???s up Jim?,David Wallace
"Uh??? [clears throat] Well, it???s about Athlead. I???m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?",Jim
"I???d love to be in the loop, David.",Dwight
"It???s okay. Go ahead, Jim.",David Wallace
There???s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor ???,Jim
"Okay. Jim, I???m gonna have to stop you right there.",David Wallace
"Yes, okay. Bye.",Jim
[whispers] I???d love to invest.,Dwight
"No, thanks.",Jim
I???d like to give you $100 million. [snickers] [phone ringing],Dwight
Why you make trees into bushes? You don???t make paper from bushes.,Hide
"Hide, they???re giving out jobs upstairs. Why don???t you go up and get one?",Pam
Thank you.,Hide
Yeah.,Pam
Whoops.,Troy
[patting Darryl???s hair] It???s dense. Like bread.,Zeke
"Dwight, you can???t just hire someone ???cause they???re your friend.",Jim
I???m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.,Dwight
"They???re freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.",Nellie
You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.,Dwight
"Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating.",Darryl
"Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch.",Wolf
"Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.",Dwight
"Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ???em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.",Dwight
Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.,Dwight
Do you want this paper?,Wolf
I sure do.,Dwight
It???s not very good.,Wolf
I will pay you whatever it takes.,Dwight
I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad.,Wolf
"No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.",Dwight
Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. It???s over.,Wolf
Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You???re still at the 570 number?,Dwight
I am.,Wolf
"Okay. Good, good, good. [sighs]",Dwight
I have eight years experience selling electronics in Sanyo store in downtown Tokyo. I was a doctor. And I have a business degree from Tokyo University.,Hide
This isn???t gonna work out.,Dwight
Thank you. [chuckles],Hide
"Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He???s a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I???m hesitant. Why can???t I pull the trigger on any of them?",Dwight
"[groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door]",Dwight
Do you need to be changed?,Melvina
I do that myself now.,Dwight
Mm. Are you going to make a decision soon? I???ve been double-parked for five hours. I???m wondering if I should move my car.,Melvina
"No, you???ve been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.",Dwight
"Well, the joke???s on them. I live right next to the tow yard. All they did was save me some gas.",Melvina
"Hey man, we get how difficult this is. And no matter how you choose, we???re still gonna be your friend.",Trevor
"Yeah, whether it???s me or Troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvina???",Wolf
Or none of you [chuckles],Dwight
"Yeah, you???d bring us all down here, put us through the wringer and then choose none of us.",Wolf
Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you.,Trevor
I wish I could hire all of you.,Dwight
I could start Monday.,Zeke
"Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.",Dwight
"Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I???m not looking south, I???m not livin???. That???s what I always say.",Jim
Just act natural. [grunts],Dwight
And I was thinking it???s only fair that you help make this decision since they???ll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.,Dwight
But you know I wouldn???t hire any of these all-stars.,Jim
"Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it???s your call.",Dwight
Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?,Jim
I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn???t picture any of them in the old gold and gray.,Dwight
I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.,Jim
Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.,Dwight
"Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?",Jim
Yes. Thank you. Amazed.,Dwight
"And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.",Jim
I???m sorry?,Sensei Ira
What? This is such bullcrap!,Dwight
"Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.",Jim
Wow. So much crap. It???s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?,Dwight
Too much now.,Jim
Okay.,Dwight
"Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep.",Nate
"Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert???s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.",Dwight
That seems inconsiderate.,Jim
"No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Don???t open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe.",Rolf
"Guys, it wasn???t up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn???t my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.",Dwight
"Well, my day???s shot.",Trevor
"Yeah, it???s that weird hour where it???s too late to start a slow roast and too early for a Swanson???s.",Rolf
I got it. Paintball.,Wolf
"Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?",Dwight
[yelling] And what are we supposed to do until then?,Trevor
Okay.,Dwight
"Let???s just go, you guys.",Wolf
"Yeah. No limit on weapons class, right?",Rolf
All right. I think that went well.,Jim
"So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that???ll print out???Hey. Meet your new desk mate.",Jim
What???s up good lookin????,Clark
"Oh, cool. Hey Clark.",Pam
"Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.",Jim
"Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.",Pam
Okay. I???m really sorry I told the guys I???d be there for the board meeting.,Jim
Of course.,Pam
I???ll call you when I get there.,Jim
Okay.,Pam
All right.,Jim
Bye.,Pam
Take care of my wife. I will be back.,Jim
They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.,Dwight
"Hey, Pam, I???m going to the kitchen. You want anything?",Clark
I???m good.,Pam
"Oh, hey, I???ll take a coffee.",Dwight
"Oh, I???m sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee.",Clark
[scoffs],Dwight
"Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?",Pam
"Who, me?",Dwight
Us.,Pam
"Absolutely, I do. [giggles]",Dwight
"Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I???ll distract him, you take that.",Pam
"Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that???s great.",Dwight
[shushes],Pam
[laughs],Pam & Dwight
Aah!,Dwight
No!,Clark
"Welcome to the club, pig! [laughs]",Dwight
"No, Dwight!",Pam
Aah!,Dwight
"No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I???m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.",Jim
Have you seen Darryl?,Nellie
He's around here somewhere.,Erin
"Mmm. [exits, Erin smiles deviously]",Nellie
"Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. [checks for anyone around] Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies.",Erin
"Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun.",Erin
"[as Darryl descends stairs, Erin ascends carrying a giant teddy bear] Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.",Erin
How much did you pay for that?,Darryl
"Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.",Erin
"Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.",Darryl
"[exiting Darryl's office] Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! [to Phyllis] That guy's hilarious. He's here today. [giant teddy bear is viewed in Darryl's office]",Erin
"I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together... [sees mural] Oh my god! [camera pans to mural with butts painted over it] Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts? [to warehouse crew] Huh? No way. No way!",Pam
"Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.",Angela
"Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids.",Erin
"No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.",Angela
"Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... [pulls cash from wallet] 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation...",Kevin
"No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.",Angela
"[undertone] Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.",Oscar
What?,Angela
He said he wanted me there for support.,Oscar
I'm his! His... wife.,Angela
"Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. [laughs] Me.",Oscar
"[on phone with Robert] We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.",Angela
[in Darryl and Jim's Philly apartment] Hey.,Jim
Hey.,Darryl
We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.,Jim
"Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates.",Darryl
"And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.",Jim
Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.,Darryl
I'm couching it!,Jim
Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.,Darryl
"And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?",Jim
"I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to [quote-unquote fingers] soak... He hooked me up with a job.",Darryl
"[ascends on lift, using megaphone] Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand. [no one replies] Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want? [descends on lift] Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice.",Pam
"I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. [boom microphone bumps her head, she smiles] I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.",Pam
"Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.",Jim
Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.,Darryl
[to camera] Who is this guy? We are killing it.,Jim
Yes sir. [notices Jim's using his coffee mug],Darryl
Yeah!,Jim
[entering office] Conference room. Everybody. Now!,Pam
You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.,Dwight
"Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting.",Pam
"You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?",Dwight
Yeah.,Pam
"Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!",Dwight
[to everyone in conference room] I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.,Pam
I thought that's what you were doing.,Erin
"Yeah, but this is different.",Pam
Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?,Erin
"I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So...",Pam
I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.,Erin
"Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.",Pam
"Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83.",Meredith
"Uh, 6783's also a good time. Less mileage.",Creed
"Pam, what can be done?",Oscar
Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question.,Pam
I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.,Oscar
What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.,Pam
David Wallace called this meeting?,Phyllis
"Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.",Pam
"[as everyone begin to leave] No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go.",Pam
"Pam, I'll help you.",Dwight
You will?,Pam
"If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime.",Dwight
Thank you.,Pam
"I am in too, Pam.",Nellie
Yeah?,Pam
"Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored.",Nellie
Great.,Pam
"I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.",Pam
[enters quickly] You need my pitchfork?,Dwight
[approaches Dwight as he leaves] Hey!,Angela
What is it? I have vengeance to exact.,Dwight
"Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.",Angela
"Ah, I'm not interested.",Dwight
What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.,Angela
"If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics. [exits]",Dwight
"Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?",Kevin
No.,Angela
"OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.",Kevin
"Aw, crap.",Angela
"[in warehouse] I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own.",Dwight
You're gonna to compare 'um to the butts up there. [gestures mural],Frank
"Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.",Dwight
I'm not drawing a butt.,Glenn
"All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws.",Nellie
Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.,Dwight
"OK, OK. I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go.",Val
"Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts...",Dwight
"Well, this is getting us nowhere.",Nellie
"We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. [they notice Nate struggling with a box] Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.",Pam
We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. [holds up phone] Nate. Your mother is dying. [Nate reacts with grief],Dwight
"See, I feel bad about that.",Pam
It's all right. It's all right.,Dwight
"So, she's gonna pull through again? [all nod] That's great. Can I talk to her?",Nate
No. She needs her rest again.,Dwight
"Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business.",Nellie
"You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.",Dwight
"Gum's gotten mintier lately. Have you noticed? Like, some of it's just too minty. It's like they're literally trying to hurt...",Nate
[interrupting] Tell us who defaced the mural!,Pam
[points at Warehouse Worker Frank] He did it.,Nate
All right. You can go. Give him his gum.,Pam
There's no gum. There never was any gum.,Dwight
[leaving] That's really rude.,Nate
"[at Phillip's party] Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck.",Kevin
[noticing a portrait of Angela on the wall] That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?,Oscar
"Ladies and gentlemen, Senator and Angela Lipton. [guests applaud]",Party Announcer
"Thanks, everybody. Thanks for coming. Phillip had no idea he was so popular.",Senator
"[laughs] Oh, Robert, you're horrible. [to other guests] Simon, Maxine. [sarcastically] Who let you guys in here?",Angela
[points to Jim and Darryl] This is the team.,Athlead Employee
"Nice job, man.",Jim
You too... Darryl.,Darryl
"[confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.",Jim
It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes.,Darryl
"Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?",Jim
That's my go-to thermos. That's all.,Darryl
"Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.",Jim
No big deal. No big deal.,Darryl
"No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.",Jim
"Nah, nah...",Darryl
No big deal.,Jim
"[as Jim empties thermos into trash] Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that.",Darryl
"Honestly, I don't mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or...",Jim
I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?,Darryl
[after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos],Jim
Thank you.,Darryl
"So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?",Nellie
"[to Nellie] Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. [Nellie nods] Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.",Pam
"[Warehouse Worker Frank remains silent, picks ear] You sort of deserve an apology here. Frank?",Toby
I'm sorry I didn't like your crappy doodles. I drew a butt. Big deal. Butts are funny.,Frank
"Well, I didn't think that butt was funny.",Pam
"Well, maybe if you got the stick out of yours.",Frank
What was that?,Pam
"You know what? You people can't fire me. So, screw you. [exits]",Frank
Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?,Pam
Uh... it... compliment...,Toby
The first 'sorry' sounded sincere.,Nellie
There were two or three 'sorry's in there. [mumbles along with Nellie],Toby
That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.,Pam
"Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.",Dwight
We should just take him down.,Pam
Wait. Are you saying...,Dwight
I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.,Pam
"Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.",Dwight
He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.,Dwight
Yes!,Pam
A little eye for an eye action.,Dwight
Yes!,Pam
Go all Hammurabi on this clown.,Dwight
We need an infiltrator.,Pam
I know just the man for the job. [looks at Clark],Dwight
Clark?,Pam
He even looks like a mole.,Dwight
One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.,Oscar
You two seem very close.,Party Guest
Yes. We're good friends. Good friends.,Senator
Yeah.,Oscar
"You know, I suppose that may ruffle a few feathers. For a long time, our party has turned it's back on the Hispanic people. Well, that is not who I am. [puts arms around Oscar] I am a friend of the Latino community. And if you ask me, it's time we bid bigotry hasta luego. [guests laugh] Now, does my embrace of Hispanics make me more electable? Given demographic trends? I don't know. And I don't care. What I care about is Oscar. [slaps Oscar's cheek] My friend. Mi amigo. Oscar. [guests applaud as he hugs Oscar]",Senator
"Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me. Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.",Oscar
"Oh, hey.",Darryl
Hey.,Jim
I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool?,Darryl
Yeah. Totally.,Jim
All right.,Darryl
[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry.,Jim
I didn't say anything.,Darryl
I don't think you had to.,Jim
Excuse me?,Darryl
"I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?",Jim
"What you need flour for, Jim?",Darryl
That's not the point.,Jim
What? You making bread?,Darryl
"No, I'm not making bread.",Jim
What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?,Darryl
"Darryl, it doesn???t matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.",Jim
"All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all.",Darryl
It's all good. Are we all good?,Jim
We good.,Darryl
What's that cooler?,Jim
Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It's mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys?,Darryl
"Oh, crap. Were those yours?",Jim
[pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?,Dwight
"Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys.",Clark
"Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.",Dwight
"OK, boss. [quietly] Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you're smarter than this.",Clark
"Shh, shh.",Pam
This is never gonna work.,Clark
Shh. Remember your lines.,Pam
What lines?,Clark
Go move some paper!,Dwight
"[to Darryl on phone] Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?",Pam
"He's not my hire, but I know who he is.",Darryl
OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...,Pam
What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?,Darryl
"Yeah, something like that.",Pam
I know he loves his pick up truck.,Darryl
"Oh, great! [to Dwight] His truck!",Pam
Great. Get the plate number.,Dwight
OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?,Pam
So we know which truck to van...,Dwight
"Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?",Darryl
Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair],Pam
"Hold on a second. Uh, Sandeep? Let's get you closer to the senator. Just about there. Great. And, Oscar? I'm gonna need you to step a little closer to the senator, as well. Somewhere there.",Party Photographer
He's blocking me.,Angela
"It's only a photo, honey.",Senator
"[to party waiter] Excuse me, uh, what's your name?",Party Photographer
Sean.,Party Waiter
LaShawn. Great. You wanna be in a photo? Right this way. [notices overweight man following] Not you. No.,Party Photographer
He put me here.,Oscar
He put you right in front of me?,Angela
Let's just wheel Margaret right in front...,Party Photographer
Ow! Robert?!,Oscar
Angela.,Senator
Smile. [Angela attempts to get in front of Oscar as pictures are taken],Party Photographer
I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?,Pam
"Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.",Dwight
"Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet.",Pam
Let's see yours.,Dwight
"Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid.",Pam
This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?,Dwight
Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.,Pam
I saw that. That's great!,Dwight
Yeah. I feel better.,Pam
"Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.",Dwight
"I know. You miss Angela, don't you?",Pam
Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.,Dwight
"I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...",Pam
[exiting building and approaching Pam] Lady! My truck? You had no right!,Frank
"No, you had no right!",Pam
"It's a $40,000 truck!",Frank
So? You started it!,Pam
So? So someone need to shut you up! [attempts to attack Pam],Frank
"Hey, hey, hey! [knocks Frank down with boom microphone]",Brian
Whoa.,Pam
[as Frank gets up] Easy! [Frank grabs him],Brian
You son of a bitch!,Frank
You're gonna hit a woman?,Brian
Thanks so much for coming. Thanks so much. [to Oscar and Angela] Well. Have we all calmed down yet?,Senator
Yes. Sorry about that.,Oscar
It was all my fault.,Angela
"Let's all try to do better next time. Kevin, great to see you.",Senator
"Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.",Kevin
I beg your pardon.,Senator
"You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good. [Oscar and Angela exit looking pleased]",Kevin
"Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers.",Pam
"No. No, it's...",Brian
"You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.",Pam
"It's all good. I knew what I was doing. It's... I'm sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that.",Brian
Forget about my mural. It's stupid.,Pam
"No. You, you worked hard on that. That guy's an animal. I'm glad they're firing him too.",Brian
"It's crazy. Brian, I'm so sorry.",Pam
"Look. I don't, I don't wanna put myself where I don't belong. If you ever need me, you just call me. And I'll be there for you.",Brian
"Thanks, Brian.",Pam
Seeya.,Brian
"Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.",Jim
[playing video game with Jim] Oh. Come on!,Darryl
Oh. Oh!,Jim
Damn!,Darryl
[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?,Jim
"That felt really good, actually.",Darryl
[to Jim] Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day.,Pam
"It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.",Jim
[makes magic trick hand gesture] Alakazam!,Pam
"By the way, they do need an extra day next week.",Jim
"And, poof! He disappears. [Jim snaps, playing along]",Pam
[to Pete] Hey! Wanna play hookey today?,Erin
"Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind?",Pete
We can do anything you want.,Erin
"I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend.",Erin
"Erin says she's gonna break up with Andy, but I'm not sure. He's coming back tomorrow and surprise, today, she wants to do whatever I'd like. You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog who go real sick and we had to 'send him to a farm'. And on his last day, we did everything he loved.",Pete
[has an idea and reveals a frisbee from under her desk] Wanna play catch in the parking lot?,Erin
[slightly surprised] Sure.,Pete
Great.,Erin
I'll get my coat.,Pete
Perfect. [Pete walks away eying the camera knowingly],Erin
"[knocks on Andy's door, then pretends to answer as Andy] Come in.",Dwight
"[talking to Andy's empty chair] Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.",Dwight
"[pretending to be Andy] I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.",Dwight
"I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. [thinks for a moment] Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown.",Dwight
"Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk.",Kevin
"[to entire office]OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.",Kevin
I say we all have one last fun boss-less day.,Nellie
"Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences.",Meredith
"Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your [to Nellie] boyfriend. But, I mean, if you don't have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness.",Phyllis
"Phil, I'll pretend to be your husband. I'm already sick of you, so it'll seem realistic.",Stanley
Oh...,Phyllis
They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. [to Meredith] They use a watch repair kit.,Angela
[to Angela] Ew! I'll be your foot buddy.,Kevin
"Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount.",Nellie
It's what I do. [everyone begins to leave],Clark
"Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...",Oscar
"No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.",Darryl
"All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my...",Oscar
[interrupting] Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it.,Darryl
[eating] These are gross.,Pam
They are terrible.,Jim
"Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.",Pam
Oh my god. That's so romantic.,Jim
It's with Brian and Alyssa.,Pam
Oh my god. That's less romantic.,Jim
"I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.",Pam
"Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?",Jim
That sounds nice.,Pam
"I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.",Jim
"Oh, tiny, poor lady is back. Oh, get the baby clipper. [other nails stylists gush over Angela]",Nail stylist 1
[to Clark] You take off your glasses.,Nail stylist 2
Kay. [removes glasses],Clark
[nail stylist 2 giggles] What?,Nellie
Your boyfriend. He look like a pretty girl.,Nail stylist 2
"My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn't he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra. [both laugh at Clark]",Nellie
"Oh, you guys think this is funny? You know what? No more discount. [to nail manager] Excuse me. [gesturing he and Nellie] Full price. We're not together.",Clark
"Oh, come on!",Nellie
She's living a lie.,Clark
"Turns out, I can't even be in a pretend relationship.",Nellie
[to nail manager] Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.,Oscar
No. No discount for two men. Two men are not a couple.,Nail manager
We are together. Romantically.,Oscar
"Two men? [other nail stylist speaks Korean to manager, both laugh] [gestures index fingers bumping together] Doesn't work. No discount.",Nail manager
"Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere. [Oscar and Darryl exit holding hands]",Darryl
"[enters restaurant with Pam] Hey, Brian.",Jim
Hey.,Brian
Sorry we're late.,Pam
"Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread.",Brian
"Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK.",Pam
What?,Jim
He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly.,Pam
Oh.,Jim
"It's, uh, great to see you guys. Thanks for coming.",Brian
Yeah.,Pam
"Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.",Jim
"It's fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, I'm fully available.",Brian
"Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.",Pam
"That's... OK, great. Does he pay well?",Brian
Where's Alyssa?,Pam
"Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssa's, she's not gonna make it today.",Brian
Oh.,Pam
"Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up.",Brian
[to Andy's empty chair] I have yet another sales order for you to sign.,Dwight
[acting as Andy] Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.,Dwight
"[in his office doorway, bearded and unkept] Hi Dwight.",Andy
You're back. [surveys Andy] And you're disgusting.,Dwight
"[as everyone returns to the office] Ah, geez. My nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours.",Phyllis
"Well, well, well, look who it is.",Andy
Andy.,Phyllis
"I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived.",Andy
Andy!,Erin
Hey! Sweetheart! [approaches Erin] I have missed you so much.,Andy
"[obviously avoiding Andy's embrace] Yes. [gives Andy high fives] Welcome back, buddy.",Erin
[attempting to hug Erin as she resists] I have been dreaming of this moment.,Andy
Me too. So much. I'm so happy.,Erin
"I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.",Erin
What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.,Oscar
"Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin. Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. [removes wooden instruments from bag] Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. [removes g??iro and begins playing and singing] Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe. [sings while Kevin echoes]",Andy
"Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.",Dwight
"Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart. [tries to embrace Erin but she begins playing cloppers] But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting.",Andy
Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?,Clark
"No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. [Andy stalls] Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?",Dwight
"I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe.",Andy
He only emailed me four times.,Erin
Question. Where's Jim?,Andy
He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch.,Phyllis
For two hours? Really?,Andy
"So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?",Oscar
"If the shoe fits. [plays g??iro and sings, Kevin echoes]",Andy
"We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb.",Brian
"Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.",Jim
"Yeah. That's the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasn't until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, it's over. [overcome by emotion] I'm sorry, this is... oh my god, OK. [to Pam] We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other.",Brian
[obviously flustered] Yeah.,Pam
What?,Jim
At least my crying won't get you fired.,Brian
Crying?,Jim
I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.,Andy
Thank you.,Dwight
And you sold it to Jan too.,Andy
Yes!,Dwight
I mean... I'm impressed.,Andy
[laughing together] Yeah!,Dwight
"Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.",Andy
You were on a boat.,Dwight
I was...,Andy
On a boat.,Dwight
That...,Andy
In the ocean.,Dwight
OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? [Dwight resists] Just say the word 'coolio'.,Andy
I'm not gonna say it.,Dwight
Say it.,Andy
Not a word.,Dwight
Coolio.,Andy
No! [Andy makes a call] What do you think you're doing?,Dwight
Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.,Andy
Don't you dare! Andy!,Dwight
[on phone] Hello?,Jan
"Hey, Jan. Nard dog here.",Andy
"Oh, Andy.",Jan
I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.,Andy
Really?,Jan
Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.,Andy
Hmm.,Jan
[whispers] Coolio.,Dwight
Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?,Jan
Coolio. Coolio.,Dwight
"No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.",Andy
Yeah.,Jan
Coolio.,Dwight
"It, it's, it's actually just an issue...",Andy
"You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.",Jan
"No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.",Dwight
"Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but...",Andy
Tell Angela to send me a final invoice.,Jan
"Well, ah, ah...",Andy
"Please Ja, Ja... [Jan hangs up]",Dwight
Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.,Andy
"[approaching Accounting] Hey, everybody, great job. [to Angela] Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks.",Andy
"Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays. [hands Andy a folder]",Angela
All right. Thank you very much. [examines checks] Looking good. [after noticing something on Angela's desk] Who's that little fella?,Andy
It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter.,Angela
"Wow, that's wonderful!",Andy
A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.,Oscar
Uh-huh.,Andy
Uh-huh.,Angela
"Uh-huh... [after awkward pause] Uh-huh. [Angela hands him the bonus check] Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed.",Andy
Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.,Dwight
"[emotional] Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week.",Clark
"He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?",Kevin
"God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.",Dwight
"I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.",Dwight
"I'm not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don't you?",Nellie
Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?,Meredith
Hey!,Erin
"Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her?",Pete
"Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands.",Erin
"Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.",Dwight
"[appears approaching group, shaved and in a suit] What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on. [singing] Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy! [resumes talking] All right. Back to work.",Andy
"OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?",Pam
"I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.",Jim
I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress.,Pam
"Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.",Jim
It's not Brian's fault.,Pam
"No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.",Jim
OK.,Pam
I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.,Andy
"Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.",Dwight
"Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. OK?",Andy
[enters] Hey guys.,David Wallace
"Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.",Andy
"Sounds great. Don't let me interrupt. What ever you guys have been doing this last quarter, I couldn't be happier with the numbers.",David Wallace
Thank you.,Andy
"Well, finish up. I'm gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes?",David Wallace
Great!,Andy
"[leaving] Great job, everybody!",David Wallace
[whispering] We had to let a warehouse guy go?!,Andy
"You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank...",Kevin
[interrupting] ??? lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.,Dwight
What?!,Andy
Yeah.,Dwight
There was a fire in the warehouse?,Andy
The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.,Dwight
Whoa.,Kevin
"This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?",Andy
We started selling balloons.,Phyllis
What?!,Andy
"Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin.",Clark
No kidding?,Andy
"Yeah. In the European billboards, she's gonna be topless.",Clark
Wow. Go Kathy. She's like 50.,Andy
They're tasteful.,Clark
"Good, good. What else?",Andy
"Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.",Andy
What fire?,David Wallace
The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes.,Andy
It looked fine to me.,David Wallace
"[catches on to the ruse] I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.",Andy
OK.,David Wallace
I think you'll agree I explained that pretty well.,Andy
"[preparing to leave] Thanks, Andy.",David Wallace
Thank you.,Andy
All right. Everyone! [waves to office and exits],David Wallace
[enters Andy's office to find him playing g??iro] Fish sounds great.,Erin
"Yeah, I guess.",Andy
"Really playing the scales, huh?",Erin
"Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?",Andy
I don't love you anymore.,Erin
What?,Andy
"I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you.",Erin
"OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.",Andy
I just said there isn't love.,Erin
"On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.",Andy
I guess.,Erin
"I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.",Andy
You got really sunburned.,Erin
"I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.",Andy
Ugh.,Erin
"I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again.",Andy
You really think we can get that back?,Erin
Yes. [hugs Erin] Come on. Totally.,Andy
You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.,Jim
Oh?,Pam
"Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?",Jim
Are you sure?,Pam
I just feel like we're gonna fight.,Jim
[obviously hurt] Yeah.,Pam
So... how 'bout let's not?,Jim
OK. [they begin to leave],Pam
"Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.",Jim
"[sees it's a drawing of hers, framed] Wow. I didn't know you kept this.",Pam
"Yeah, yeah.",Jim
Thank you.,Pam
No problem.,Jim
I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.,Pam
You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day?,Jim
"Yeah, I do.",Pam
"OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.",Jim
Hi.,Erin
"Hey, you OK?",Pete
I couldn't do it.,Erin
Oh.,Pete
I'm sorry.,Erin
"Oh, you don't have to apologize. I just... I just want you to be happy. OK? [Erin smiles and kisses Pete]",Pete
"[bursts into Andy's office] We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.",Erin
"[on phone] Hey, Andy. It's David. Still here. What was that about three months?",David Wallace
"...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!",David Wallace
"I resent that. I, I never lied to you.",Andy
"Really? [reading from phone] ???Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA.???",David
And all was good in Scranton PA that day.,Andy
"???By the way, Oscar says 'hi'???",David
Oscar says ???hi??? all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. ???Hi??? ???Hello??? ???Hola??? You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say ???hi????,Andy
Andy.,David
But you're calling me a liar.,Andy
Andy!,David
"By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately.",Andy
Watch it Andy!,David
"Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. [Reading from phone] ???Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick.??? Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!",Andy
My wife?,David
This has been a really tough time.,Andy
Yeah?,David
Yeah.,Andy
Has it?,David
"Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.",Andy
Shh.,David
It was like a security blan-,Andy
Andy.,David
-ket,Andy
Shh. I'm not gonna fire you.,David
You're not?,Andy
No.,David
That's awesome.,Andy
I wouldn't own the company if it wasn't for you. So...I owe you that.,David
"David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it.",Andy
We are even...now. Understand? Got it?,David
Crystal.,Andy
"You are on very- Hey, very thin ice.",David
Vanilla. [David looks confused] Vanilla Ice. It was a band.,Andy
Good morning.,Andy
Good morning.,Erin
"And how are you on this fine- [chokes up, runs into office and slams door pulling the blinds closed]",Andy
"[Crying] Ok, we ready? [cut] Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.",Andy
[Moaning from office] Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh,Andy
He sounds like a wounded animal.,Pam
Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her.,Stanley
"I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad.",Phyllis
I'm the same way with horny people.,Stanley
Ok. [Andy continues moaning],Pam
Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.,Erin
"[taking paper from Kevin] Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you.",Pam
"Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. [laughs] I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.",Pam
"[on phone] No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.",Dwight
[Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you.,Dwight
Ahh! Dwight!,Angela
"And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.",Dwight
What? What is it?,Angela
"It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.",Dwight
"Dwight, that's awful.",Angela
"You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was ???poisoned??? by Aunt Shirley.",Dwight
What do you mean by ???poisoned????,Angela
"Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.",Dwight
"Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt.",Angela
Thank you.,Dwight
But I don't see how this is my problem.,Angela
"Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-",Dwight
Ugh.,Angela
And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.,Dwight
Gah.,Angela
"There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.",Dwight
It's fine.,Angela
"It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?",Dwight
"Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll-",Angela
It's a divet...,Dwight
I'll help you!,Angela
"..where it was and it needs, it needs a...",Dwight
Ugh.,Angela
Where are you going?,Andy
"Uh, not on a three month boat trip.",Pam
"Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?",Andy
How dare you?,Dwight
I'm still the boss!,Andy
I...,Erin
The answer is yes.,Andy
..just have some messages for you.,Erin
Are they from you?,Andy
"Well no, they're from clients.",Erin
"Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.",Andy
I can't. I-,Erin
"Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.",Andy
These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.,Erin
I don't want to talk about work right now.,Andy
Well I only want to talk about work right now.,Erin
Then I want my big blue sweater back.,Andy
"Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.",Erin
I've got the seat adjusted right.,Pete
"Perfect height, yeah.",Clark
She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?,Andy
I was just leaving.,Pete
"Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.",Andy
I don't know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men.,Pete
"Survey says: ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?",Andy
"Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you've got your freedom now.",Clark
Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.,Andy
"There you go, good for you.",Clark
No.,Andy
"You just let it all hang out, that's what...",Clark
"May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you. [Andy leaves]",Andy
I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.,Clark
"Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight.",Dwight
"Oh, lookie here. It's big city Dwight. Careful you don't get mud on those fancy town shoes, big city Dwight.",Shirley
Hello Aunt Shirley.,Angela
Who's this little kitchen witch? She's so tiny like a little kitchen witch.,Shirley
"This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!",Dwight
New clothes? What for? [Aunt Shirley's boob shows],Shirley
OK,Dwight
"Oh, God.",Angela
"You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.",Dwight
Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?,Angela
How would you like a mean cold slap? [slaps Angela],Shirley
Ow!,Angela
"Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?",Dwight
I could do that.,Shirley
Ok.,Dwight
No. No.,Angela
"Yeah, trust me.",Dwight
No.,Angela
"It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.",Dwight
Step on it!,Shirley
"Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.",Andy
"Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping.",Phyllis
"I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen.",Andy
You're clearly snooping.,Oscar
"That's kinda uncool, man.",Creed
"Ah, come on.",Meredith
Andy!,Phyllis
That's her private property.,Oscar
Tell us!,Meredith
"Uh, hello! Who's snooping on who now?",Andy
What does that even mean?,Phyllis
What's it say?,Meredith
Put it down.,Phyllis
"Everyone please, just-",Andy
It's not cool.,Creed
Put it down,Phyllis
Andy. That is her private property.,Oscar
Boo.,Meredith
Oh my god.,Andy
Uh huh.,Stanley
See?,Phyllis
That's where nosey'll get you.,Stanley
Told you so.,Phyllis
"Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.",Andy
"Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.",Darryl
Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?,Andy
Pete...,Kevin
Hmm.,Clark
Pete what?,Kevin
"It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete.",Pete
[whispers] hello!,Pam
Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?,Jim
"Hi! Hey, do I look ok?",Pam
You look great.,Jim
Ok,Pam
Yeah.,Jim
[pointing to Jim's bluetooth headset] What's that? Is that a-,Pam
"Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]",Jim
"Gotta go, VIP just walked through the door.",Isaac
"How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.",Pam
It's a phone?,Isaac
"Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.",Pam
"Of course, anything for Team Halpert. You're gonna crush it, Pam.",Isaac
Thanks.,Pam
"You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.",Jim
"Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.",Pam
[touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?,Jim
Ha ha.,Pam
"Hey, Jim! We've got Trent Edwards on the line.",Athlead Coworker
"I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!",Jim
Bye.,Pam
"Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.",Angela
"In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.",Dwight
[coughs and laughs in her sleep],Shirley
"Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.",Dwight
Spray her down?,Angela
"No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.",Dwight
Hey.,Pete
"Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted [reading computer screen] shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh?",Andy
Yeah. [long pause] You were gone.,Pete
I knew it!,Andy
"For a long time, Andy.",Pete
You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!,Andy
"Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap.",Pete
No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!,Andy
What?,Pete
"Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. [singing] So you had a bad day-",Andy
Andy?,Pete
..The camera don't lie!,Andy
Andy.,Pete
You're being an idiot get..,Andy
I'm trying..,Pete
"Out of my office, turns out you're fired...",Andy
Andy.,Pete
Because you suck.,Andy
You can't fire-,Pete
And you're fired...,Andy
If you want to talk to me,Pete
So you had a bad day...,Andy
I'll be in the annex.,Pete
Rut ti doh doh...,Andy
Alright? I'll be in the annex.,Pete
Rut tit doh doh...,Andy
Toby!,Pete
Rut ti doh doo doh,Andy
Toby?,Pete
"You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right?",Toby
No.,Andy
"Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You can't just get rid of people over grudges.",Toby
Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.,Andy
"Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin.",Toby
"They already have a contract? [Reading] ???Mutually agree to-??? Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.",Andy
"It's just boiler plating, you don't have to read it.",Toby
"Well, I'm not signing away my rights.",Andy
I already signed it. I was just showing you.,Toby
"Ok, well we'll see about that. [crumples paper]",Andy
"Andy, it's not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy. [Andy throws paper at him and leaves, Toby straightens paper out] It's the original.",Toby

"Oh, hi. They call me Marky Mark around here, because here at Simon Realty, we are one funky bunch! Come on you guys, raise the roof when I say that! I- what are you all temps again today? Let's go, Gangnam style. [laughs] He's heard Gangnam style, he knows it. Right? That's cause he's American. This is Carl. Uh, he's from here. Our neck of the woods. But Gangnam style is great, isn't it?",Mark
Oh my god. He's Michael Scott.,Pam
Time to get clean!,Shirley
"It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.",Dwight

Yes ma'am.,Dwight
Good.,Angela
"This is not an office so much as it is a uh, rec room with a bunch of computers in it. Frankly, if I had my way, I'd toss the computers in the gar-bage. But unfortunately we use them for practically everything we do. So. That ain't gonna happen. He's a temp, don't worry about him. Alice! Alright, stay awake ok?",Mark
Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up.,Toby
Um.,Nellie
Y'know I've been going over my notes from the trial...,Toby
Oh no.,Nellie
...feel like I may have glossed over a few...,Toby
No no no no.,Nellie
...minor points.,Toby
"No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes.",Nellie
I've been drafting a letter.,Toby
For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don't want to hear it!,Nellie
"My aunt Joan. Oh, uh well, she uh, she worked here before I did, so there's no nepotism involved. In fact, to be honest with you I'm probably a little harder on her than I am on the rest of these people. Ah, cute. Not work on this...work on this months. Ok Nana? Uh, when I say ???Chillax??? people chillax. Watch this. Hey Roger, chillax! Must not have heard me.",Mark
No. I heard you.,Roger

"Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk....",Meredith
Ugh.,Andy
Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.,Meredith
"Come on Andy, they're a good match.",Phyllis
That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.,Andy
"Hey, Andy.",Darryl
What?!,Andy
You've got a booger bubble going on there.,Darryl
[wipes nose] Sorry.,Andy
It's ok.,Darryl
My whole life is a booger bubble!,Andy
This is a tiny resume. Papa Smurf! Come back to the mushroom. [Pam laughs] From The Smurfs movie.,Mark
"Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-",Pam
"What does this say here? To ti te per tat... what language is this? Swahili? Oh wait a second, now I can read it.",Mark
"Oh, cause it was upside down. [both laugh]",Pam
You're a good audience. [Pam laughs],Mark
So um-,Pam
Unlike some of these people around here.,Mark
"Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-",Pam
"Yeah, we don't have a lot of call for doodling around here. But I like this resume and here's why. It shows that you stick around. Yeah. You don't jump ship easily. Like a lot of these people. I mean they worship me you know? But do they like me? I mean...you think they like me, Pam?",Mark
Yes.,Pam

Hey. You got a sec to talk?,Pete
Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation: penis. Translation? My manhood.,Andy
"Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you've gotta move on.",Pete
"Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.",Andy
"Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.",Erin
Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.,Andy
"Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now.",Pete
See? We can all be friends!,Erin
Yeah.,Pete
"Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward.",Erin
I do think we can have a fair....,Pete
"Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun.",Andy
"Nothing to see here! Boss at work. This will be your desk. Right up front. Best seat on the roller coaster, you must be this tall to ride this ride. No pregnant women allowed. Are you? Uh, yeah I don't- not allowed to ask. So...",Mark
I am not pr-,Pam
You're not.,Mark
"Pregnant, no.",Pam
I didn't ask her if she was pregnant. She just offered it. The last three girls here all got pregnant.,Mark
Wow.,Pam
"Don't be afraid, it's a different chair. I don't want a guy up here. I want to you know, see a woman come in and do a great job. Something that, I have to look out this window, I want someone-",Mark
I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.,Pam
"It is. Yeah, you would uh manage this office. Answer the phones and forward the calls and uh you know, go for a coffee run now and again.",Mark
"So, kinda like a receptionist.",Pam
"Yeah, like a receptionist, but we call you the office manager because uh, it's less demeaning. By the way, how long are these uh, cameras gonna be following you around? Because I think this is pretty cool. Pretty pretty cool. Larry David, Curb Your Enthusiasm. Do you like that show?",Mark
Yes.,Pam
"Well, I think they indulge themselves a little too much. I like scripted.",Mark
"I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't.",Pam
Ow! The braid is too tight.,Shirley
Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.,Angela
Yes ma'am.,Shirley
"I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.",Angela
Ok.,Shirley
There.,Angela
Thank you Angela.,Shirley
I'm going to the prison. This afternoon. I'm gonna talk to the strangler.,Toby
Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler.,Nellie
Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.,Darryl
Well I just wanted to say I'm doing it. [Toby leaves],Toby
He's doing it.,Nellie
[on phone] hey!,Pam
"Hey, how'd the interview go?",Jim
"Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-",Pam
"I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.",Jim
Eight? Really?,Pam
"I'll make it worth your while, I promise.",Jim
"Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight.",Pam
"Alright, love you.",Jim
Love you.,Pam
Hi.,Alice
Hi.,Erin
I'm here from BCI Marketing Consultants to meet with Andrew Bernard.,Alice
Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.,Erin
"Ok, great. Thanks.",Alice
Fresh meat! Fresh meat! [Making kissing noises],Meredith
"Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way.",Erin
Nice to meet you. Cute sweater.,Alice
"Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk.",Erin
I'm Kevin.,Kevin
Pete?,Alice
Alice. Oh man.,Pete
"It's uh, been a while, huh?",Alice
"What, do you two know each other?",Erin
"Yeah. We uh, have a history.",Pete
Oh.,Erin
"History. Wow, ok. We dated for two years.",Alice
That's so random.,Erin
Well. Is it?,Pete
Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. [runs to front office],Erin
"Hey Erin, look who's back. The bird man.",Creed
Hello beautiful.,Gabe
Didn't you two used to do it?,Kevin
We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.,Gabe
She's looking good.,Creed
"Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb.",Toby
"This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it? [imitating Humphrey Bogart] I think this is a start of my first friendship.",Toby
So Pete was a librarian?,Clark
He worked as a librarian freshman year.,Alice
Was he like the sexy librarian?,Clark
Ok.,Pete
Is there like somebody who's in charge of marketing? Maybe I should sit near him or her.,Alice
Hi.,Andy
Hi.,Alice
"Hi, how's it going?",Andy
Hi. [laughs] Good. I'd love to discuss strategy with you if you have a marketing p-,Alice
Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?,Andy
"Andy, that is really inappropriate.",Pete
Awkward.,Andy
It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you've contrived.,Pete
[high pitched] Really uncomfortable situation.,Andy
Yeah.,Pete
"It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta ???move on???. Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm. [leaves]",Andy
So there's no marketing department.,Alice
No.,Clark
No.,Pete
"You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, I've lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, it's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin.",Gabe
So Andy just called you up out of the blue?,Erin
Yeah. He told me you two broke up.,Gabe
Yeah.,Erin
You must be pretty horny. [Erin shakes head no],Gabe
"well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal? [Toby nods] One week? [Toby shakes head] Ok, two weeks? [Toby nods] Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isn't that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave.",Nellie
I feel like a show pony.,Shirley
And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.,Dwight
You're welcome. Would you like some stew?,Angela
By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?,Dwight
Mmhm.,Angela
Would you like the stink sack?,Dwight
Is it any good?,Angela
"No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.",Dwight
Thank you. [both laugh],Angela
"So, when's the wedding?",Shirley
"Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.",Angela
That's what Mose said about his lady scarecrow and look what he did to that poor thing.,Shirley
Hello?,Pam
Hey! Back here.,Jim
"Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?",Pam
"Si, senor.",Jim
"Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job.",Pam
Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?,Jim
"Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate.",Pam
Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.,Jim
[laughs] You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.,Pam
"Alright. So, tell me all about it.",Jim
"Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.",Dwight
"It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight.",Angela
"Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.",Dwight
"No, Dwight. The Senator.",Angela
"Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.",Dwight
"I can't be your monkey, Dwight.",Angela
I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.,Dwight
I made a vow. I gave my word.,Angela
Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.,Dwight
"Good night, D.",Angela
How are you doing? Is it really rough?,Erin
It is so unpleasant. You?,Pete
"Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.",Andy
Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day?,Andy
"Honestly, it was a little weird.",Gabe
"Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?",Andy
I still wear Erin's button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like we're still in a relationship-,Gabe
Gabe!,Erin
...a lot of the time.,Gabe
"And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.",Andy
"Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy.",Pete
"Ok, while we're rewriting history, you never had a drinking problem.",Alice
It was college. That is what you do.,Pete
"Yeah you're also supposed to go to classes, so there's that.",Alice
"Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?",Erin
"We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?",Andy
[laughs] Oh no no no no no no. She wouldn't even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out.,Gabe
"Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.",Erin
I got a tattoo for you.,Gabe
I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!,Erin
Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing.,Gabe
"So you're dating a secretary now? Moving up in the world, Pete.",Alice
She's nice to me.,Pete
How's that P.E. degree coming? That's what he wanted to be. His dream in college was to be a gym teacher.,Alice
"Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-",Erin
I technically cannot. I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle.,Gabe
Oh my god.,Pete
"What kind of music are you into, Peter?",Gabe
"Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe.",Pete
Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan?,Gabe
No!,Pete
"Erin, are you even hearing this?",Gabe
He didn't even say that.,Erin
"He is not a very sophisticated man, I mean he can't even use chopsticks, so. Do I need to say anything else?",Alice
"Erin, I've been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night.",Gabe
"Gabe, I don't-",Erin
Give me one night with you...,Gabe
What is that supposed to mean?,Erin
I have shaved everything...,Gabe
I don't want you to shave everything.,Erin
"I wasted two years of my life on you, you realize that right?!",Alice
I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man. [Erin and Gabe argue in background],Pete
I am as smooth as a porpoise. {Erin argues],Gabe
Why don't you say in the beginning: ???This isn't really going that well???,Pete
Shove his sashimi!,Gabe
What do you-!,Erin
Because I had to wait- [all argue],Alice
"Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? [Erin & Gabe and Alice & Pete argue in background] Yeah. Yeah, it does.",Andy
"So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.",Pam
Tell me about the cologne. How much?,Jim
"Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least.",Pam
You're definitely hoarding this by the way.,Jim
Guess what poster he had on his wall?,Pam
Austin Powers.,Jim
MmMm.,Pam
Ferris Bueller.,Jim
MmMm. You're getting colder.,Pam
Not Night at the Roxbury.,Jim
[laughs] No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.,Pam
"I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?",Jim
"I don't know, but it's interesting right?",Pam
It's fascinating.,Jim
He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.,Pam
"That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?",Jim
Mmhm.,Pam
"So, next interview has to be better.",Jim
I don't know.,Pam
What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.,Jim
"I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this.",Pam
[long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.,Jim
"Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.",Pam
And I have started a business in Philadelphia. [Pam shrugs],Jim
My grandfather know. Mah Jong will be here to stay. Hobbies of the East continues in a moment.,Oscar's Computer
"You could all be doing this, just saying.",Oscar
"I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.",Oscar
Why can't you just do regular sit-ups?,Stanley
"I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright [tries to pull himself up] Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?",Oscar
"Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now?",Kevin
Can someone please help me?,Oscar
"Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please? [Erin moves Oscar out of the way for Phyllis]",Phyllis
"Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me? [Kevin shuts door] I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good. [Oscars computer reads: Coming this May: The Office: An American Workplace. Ten years in the making, a look at the lives and loves of an average American small business office.] Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?",Oscar
[as elevator door closes] Hold it!,Dwight
[notices something new about Dwight] New glasses.,Creed
"Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.",Erin
I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.,Dwight
"Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?",Pam
"I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.",Dwight
My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.,Dwight
My condolences.,Jim
Keep them.,Dwight
"OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?",Jim
"In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.",Dwight
[after Dwight tosses dirt on her face] What color is it?,Erin
It looks pretty black.,Phyllis
"[after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right.",Kevin
"[while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.",Oscar
Excuse me?,Dwight
"I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...",Oscar
OK. That's not... [tosses red dirt in Oscar's face],Dwight
I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.,Oscar
[as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.,Jim
I really hope so. [unexpectedly tosses dirt in Pam's face],Dwight
OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.,Jim
I miss her so much.,Dwight
OK.,Jim
You know? [Dwight screams and throws dirt ball at Jim],Dwight
[playing guitar and singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning'] Zeke's here.,Mose
Zeke.,Dwight
"Hey, Dwight. Mose, Mom says 'hi'.",Zeke
Hi' to Mom.,Mose
Are you going?,Dwight
Will there be ghosts there?,Mose
[simultaneously with Zeke] Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.,Dwight
You get in the sidecar.,Zeke
Get...,Dwight
"[at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here?",Dwight
You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.,Oscar
"[smirking] Oh, yeah.",Dwight
[as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?,Oscar
"Jeb, my brother.",Dwight
You have a brother?,Oscar
Uh-huh.,Dwight
I didn't really see a better parking spot. [drives into the dug grave] Whoa! Look what I did. It's a rental. [Dwight approaches and hugs him] You wanna go in? [both attempt to put the other in the dug grave],Jeb
"[upon seeing Todd Packer enter the office] Oh, gosh.",Erin
"Hey, Moonface. Nice to see those shiny, little Chinese eyes of yours.",Todd Packer
[to Pam] Who's this guy?,Clark
??? bad.,Pam
"Hi, all.",Todd Packer
"Why are you here, Todd?",Phyllis
"OK. Let's get right to it. I guess. My name is Todd Packer and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous and step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did.",Todd Packer
"Packer, we accept. [others disagree]",Kevin
"Actually, they have a specific way I need to do this. And, I have to go through examples of stuff. OK. Uh, where to begin. [to Pam] Hey. Pam-pam and her pam-pams. Wow. I have said some crude things about those. But, they are beautiful. And, I guess that's why I acted out. Pam, I'm sorry I objectified you. And, personified your breasts. Sorry, guys. [to Phyllis] Oh boy. I have not been nice to you. Philly, I'm sorry for the things I said about your size. To your face, behind your back, and in the form of drawings. Actually, that goes to all you double XLs. Stanley, Kevin, [points to Clark] this kid in a few years.",Todd Packer
"Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology.",Pam
"Why can't I just be nice? Truth is, I really like you guys. I really do. OK. The apology???s just half of it. The big thing is making amends. And, that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown Mall and I got you all cupcakes. From that place 'Nipples'.",Todd Packer
I think it's called 'Nibbles'.,Pam
"Huh. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? [hands cupcake to Erin] There you go.",Todd Packer
"Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake.",Pam
We are here today to join this woman and the ground. Man is born of woman and his life is full of turmoil.,German Minister
[gathers and tastes soil] Huh. It's crap soil. Nothing's going to grow here.,Jeb
Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery.,Dwight
"Yeah, well, I'm just saying it's garbage soil, that's all.",Jeb
"Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.",Dwight
It's fine 'cause they're not going to grow.,Jeb
"Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.",Dwight
Good. I agree. Don't worry about it. You won't get any.,Jeb
Would the family care to say something?,German Minister
You had black hair and then gray hair.,Dwight
"You were the aunt to my cousins. Most of your life you were 5'4???, at the end you were 5'1???.",Zeke
They're a descriptive people.,Oscar
[approaches and hugs Dwight] I see you started without me.,Fannie
"You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?",Dwight
"Well, I told you...",Fannie
"Hi, Fannie.",Jeb
Hey.,Fannie
Who is that?,Oscar
Dwight's sister.,Zeke
Dwight has a sister?,Oscar
Yeah.,Zeke
She's beautiful.,Oscar
Blugh.,Zeke
"[to his nephew Cameron] Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. [after a weak handshake] What is this? Oh, god. [after a truck with many girls in the bed pulls up] Henry.",Dwight
Dwight.,Henry
I see Esther's back in town.,Dwight
Hi Dwight.,Esther
Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.,Dwight
This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn.,Esther
"Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.",Dwight
We're at a funeral. There's a funeral going on here.,Fannie
OK.,Dwight
Anyone mention her height?,Henry
Yep.,Zeke
"Land size? [all shake heads] [removes hat] Shirley, at 1600 acres, you have the largest farm in the area. Sharing borders with six other farms. Including my own farm. And your nephew Dwight's. [replaces hat] OK. [drives away]",Henry
"So, let's get it going.",Dwight
"[approaches Fannie, offering a shotgun] Would you want to do the honors?",German Minister
"Oh, right. Uh, you know, I don't think we have to do this.",Fannie
"We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.",Dwight
[after Dwight opens coffin and begins firing into it] That's it for me. [exits],Oscar
I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction.,Pam
"I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy.",Phyllis
"We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?",Pam
"$3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen.",Creed
"I never forget a number. Names? In one ear and out the other. Places? Nope. Faces? That's rich. But, numbers? I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant.",Creed
"Hey, man. I don't think we've met. I'm Clark.",Clark
"Oh. I'm Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat, little runt earlier.",Todd Packer
You didn't actually say that.,Clark
No? Wow. I'm in this mode now where I'm apologizing for thoughts that are in my head. [Clark fake laughs] Hey. I have a crazy feeling [hands Clark a cupcake] that you are really gonna like this.,Todd Packer
"Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. [to Nellie] And you did fire him.",Stanley
"I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong.",Nellie
Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?,Pam
Do they even have a bakery anymore?,Angela
"They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day.",Kevin
"So, it really is just about the cupcakes.",Pam
"Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes.",Andy
"So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?",Phyllis
[as all agree] OK.,Meredith
OK. Packer can go to hell.,Phyllis
"[on a recorded video] Thank you for coming to my funeral. As I gaze at life's big sunset, I can't help but wonder where it all went wrong. You've all disappointed me greatly. Fannie. A single mamma in the city.",Aunt Shirley

"I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.",Dwight
"We can't just sit by and watch our family farm disappear. So, here are my terms. Dwight, Fannie, Jeb. If you come back home, I will leave you my farm. So, there, you have it.",Aunt Shirley
Is she crazy? [as Dwight considers] Dwight?,Fannie
Buddy? Buddy?,Jeb
"No, no, no.",Fannie
Snap out of it. Dwight?,Jeb
Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.,Dwight
"No, no, no. I'm not moving back here. Are you crazy?",Fannie
Of course you are.,Dwight
"Look. I, I don't want to be mean or like insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it's just that farm life lacks a certain... sort of sophistication.",Fannie
Oh my god.,Dwight
"That Cammy and I are drawn to. And, I don't know. The men are just... it's almost like there's a... a willing ignorance.",Fannie
"Yes. I, thank you for asking me. I actually have written a little bit of poetry. That's crazy. And, I was recently published. Which is just... [reaches in to bag, removes folded paper] maybe I have. Yep. I do. Here it is from the um, Hartford Women's Lit Quarterly.com. A Willing Ignorance by Fannie Schrute.",Fannie
"Totally. Yep. The people here are like [makes farting sound, laughs] Like a fart. You know what I'm saying? Like a fart?",Jeb
You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.,Dwight
Couple of nights couldn't hurt.,Jeb
"Uh, somehow how I think a couple of nights could hurt.",Fannie
"You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes.",Dwight
[as Dwight says 'yes'] Absolutely.,Zeke
"Growing up with Dwight and Mose was not easy. Uh, Dwight was obviously the cool one. And, Mose was the visionary. Which left me to be the comedian.",Zeke
That doesn't work on me.,Fannie
OK.,Dwight
"By the way, that's not...",Fannie
[counts down in French],Dwight
"Very funny. OK. Oui, oui, oui.",Fannie
Oui.,Dwight
Oh my goodness.,Fannie
"[while everyone is gathered playing and singing ???Sons & Daughters???] People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.",Dwight
"[after seeing Dwight lay something down in front of Esther] So, I forgot about this old custom. If a man is interested in courting a woman, he may throw the beaks of a crow at her. And then, if she's interested in accepting the courtship, she has to destroy the beaks. [Esther crushes the beaks leaving Dwight satisfied]",Fannie

"I am going through a twelve-step program. I'm currently on step zero. Which is have a [expletive] of fun. I spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and then layering in a variety of drugs, some legal, some not. Some laxative, some constipating. You don't fire the Pac-Man and expect to get away with it.",Todd Packer
"Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. [after noticing Angela easting cupcake] Hey!",Pam
"What, Pam?",Angela

Kevin?,Angela
"[after long choking and refusing help from Meredith] Oh, that was fantastic.",Kevin
"[after following Dwight to the chicken coop, before sunrise] Is it dangerous to take the eggs in front of them?",Cameron
"Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.",Dwight
I was just asking you something I didn't know.,Cameron
"Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit.",Dwight
[after grabbing an egg] Are we gonna eat these today?,Cameron
If you want.,Dwight
Is that a guillotine?,Cameron
"This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking.",Dwight
[referencing goat] That's a cow?,Cameron
Did you just ask me if this was a cow?,Dwight
[after seeing Dwight smelling milk] What are you doing now?,Cameron
Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?,Dwight
I don't know.,Cameron
"Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?",Dwight
I don't know any of that.,Cameron
"OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?",Dwight
I never met him.,Cameron
"Good morning, Erin.",Pam
[looking disheveled] Hey.,Erin
"Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's OK.",Pam
"I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.",Phyllis
Phyllis!,Pam
Packer laced the cupcakes.,Clark
No!,Pam
Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?,Meredith
Some of us got both. [raises hand],Angela
Oh my god! Is everyone OK?,Pam
"Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.",Phyllis
"Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet.",Nellie
Me too. [holds up four fingers],Stanley
"I went Christmas caroling in March and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So, not my best night. But, not my worst night.",Clark
"What did you do, Andy?",Phyllis
"Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. [cuts to him arm wrestling Kevin] Na, nothing really. Kevin?",Andy
Why would you ask me?,Kevin
"I'm not, a... I'm just. I don't know. [cuts to him spinning a plate like a record and Kevin dancing] Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um. [cuts to he and Kevin sitting on a table touching each others face] Pretty normal night.",Andy
[he and Andy embrace each other in tears] My night was just like that. [cuts to him and Andy trading clothes] Meaning normal.,Kevin
Yeah. I didn't see you last night at all. [cuts to him dancing by prostrate Kevin],Andy
Nope. I did not see you either.,Kevin
Wow. He is officially the worst human being.,Pam
[as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake],Kevin
"But, Kevin that's...",Pam
"Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand.",Kevin

"That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.",Darryl
"Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.",Jim
It's OK. I'm over it.,Todd Packer
Oof. This is no nine-acre worm farm. This is a beast. Whoever's managing this thing is gonna have a hell of a job. Not it.,Jeb
Not it.,Fannie
"It. [to Fannie] That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that.",Dwight
All right.,Fannie
Uh oh. She's doing it again.,Kevin
"Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey. Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um...",Pam
It's porn.,Clark
Yeah.,Pam
"[Phyllis rocks her chair into his provocatively] Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.",Dwight
Why?,Phyllis
"Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public.",Darryl
"Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.",Pam
Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish.,Meredith
Ugh. Ew.,Group
What?,Andy
Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak.,Dwight
Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?,Angela
He- he can't do that. Turns out she's allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal. It doesn't become a violation until she physically acts on it.,Toby
No!,Group
"Toby, how do you propose that we-",Oscar
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?",Andy
She's listening to 50 Shades of Grey.,Pam

What the hell?!,Phyllis
"It's OK guys, she's no longer horny.",Dwight
"Excuse me, dirty birdie [takes Phyllis' iPod]",Andy

"Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.",Dwight
Oh.,Clark
[laughs] What do you think?,Dwight
The same thing that you think.,Clark
A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.,Dwight
"God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air.",Clark
"Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.",Angela
Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther. She's coming here this afternoon with her father. Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart! [laughs],Angela
[on phone] Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week.,Pam
Oh man. [laughs],Jim
I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'.,Pam
"Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.",Jim
[laughs] Um.,Pam
What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?,Jim
You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?,Pam

"[sighs] Um, Ok. Well?",Pam
"Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?",Jim
"Yeah, sounds good. Ok.",Pam

Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.,Kevin
"This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.",Kevin
[Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction],Kevin
Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.,Angela
"[Pam smiles as she watches the promo with her and Jim on the roof] Oh my god, is that you and Jim?",Clark
Uh huh.,Pam
"Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really? [laughs] Yikes. That is awful.",Clark
It wasn't so bad.,Pam
"Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing. ???Banjo at 0:19 is aight??? Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy. I mean that's the guy's name, right? ChobbleGobbler?",Andy

I bet she does. I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.,Angela
Did I tell you about her teeth?,Dwight
"Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper.",Erin
Yes.,Angela
"Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome.",Dwight
Fine office you have here. Sturdy walls.,Mr. Ruger
"Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always.",Dwight
Thank you. [Dwight kisses her forehead],Esther
"I guess men find Esther attractive. I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing.",Angela
Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.,Pam
[eating soft pretzel] We've all changed.,Stanley
"With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number.",Jim
"And we all know, baseball does not last forever.",Darryl
"I look at these actors on TV and I think: ???C'mon, I can do that.???",Ryan Howard
Right? [laughs],Jim
Watch this: Eat Fresh. Now what does that make you think of?,Ryan Howard
Subway sandwiches.,Darryl
Yep.,Jim
How? I didn't say Subway sandwiches. It's called playing the subtext.,Ryan Howard
Wow.,Jim
"I actually wrote a screenplay, it's called ???The Big Piece???",Ryan Howard
"Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical.",Jim
"Half biopic and half superhero movie. A mild mannered professional baseball player, Ryan Howard-",Ryan Howard

"Ok, great.",Jim
"Andy, are there documentary groupies?",Kevin
Of course there are!,Andy
Of course.,Kevin
"A little ironic that I'm going to be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flendermen novel [groups groans] was based on a murdered TV star. The small screen-",Toby
"Oh, I don't care.",Nellie
"Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark.",Oscar

It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.,Oscar
Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?,Phyllis
Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified],Angela
"There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.",Angela
Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.,Oscar

Hey.,Erin
Oscar.,Angela
I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.,Oscar
"I have been very honest with you guys. In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine. You're not going to use any of that, are you?",Oscar
"People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon says: ???You guys are killing it!??? I mean, we're internet sensations guys!",Andy
I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.,Angela
"Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something]",Stanley
"Ok everyone, turn off your mikes.",Oscar
We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?,Angela
I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar. Did they film that?,Erin
My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more [Angela and Oscar make disgusted faces] I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone.,Nellie
"Ok, Pam. Why don't you visit your buddy, the crew guy that got fired? Find out what they got.",Pete

The lift capacity's up at two thousand pounds. That's a lot of beets.,Salesmen
"Let's talk terms. If you agree to a forty sixty split on this tractor, I'll store it in one of my barns.",Mr. Ruger

No.,Dwight
Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.,Clark
What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?,Dwight
I don't even know what an auger is!,Clark

How much stuff you got.,Pam
Pretty much everything.,Brian
"Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?",Pam
"They've got parabolic mikes, they can pick you up a hundred yards away, so...no if you were around there, they got you.",Brian

"Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could???ve met in the lobby. It???s time to go out on a sale! Here we go.",Dwight
"Son, you???ve lost your mind. I???m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.",Stanley
"The buyer is your sister???s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that???s an order.",Dwight
"You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.",Stanley
Your morning 3-by-5. Coming right up.,Pete
"Well, we won???t be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.",Pam
"Oh, your mom???s watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? [chuckles] Oh, um, Embassy Suites. ???Do Not Disturb??? sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor.",Nellie
[laughs] I wish.,Pam
"[chuckles] What, then?",Nellie
"Oh, nothing that exciting.",Pam
Marriage counseling?,Nellie
Hmm.,Pam
Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had?,Nellie
"You know, Jim???s kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.",Pam
Mmm.,Nellie
"I mean, we???ve having issues. It can???t hurt to talk about them, right?",Pam
"Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.",Jim
"Oh, sure.",Toby
"It???s a little, uh, personal.",Jim
Let???s do it. Let???s get personal.,Toby
I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.,Jim
Whoa.,Toby
"Sorry. I???no, no, no, what I meant???what I meant actually was???",Jim
"Oh, yeah, no, it???s okay. I can handle it. Um, so???",Toby
You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.,Jim
"[chuckles, snorts]",Toby
Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple???s counseling.,Jim
"Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren???t in couple???s counseling, are you? Oh, God.",Toby
"No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we???re just starting couple???s counseling. Uh, which doesn???t sound any better.",Jim
"Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So s???hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here.",Toby
My mistake.,Clark
"Yes, it is your mistake. He???s lingering. So annoying. I???m gonna kill him. How can I help? I???m here.",Toby
That???s all right.,Jim
"Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I???ll hold. I???m sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye. [hangs up phone]",Andy
"Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. [Stan??closes limo door]??Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.",Angela
Don???t worry. I???ve scheduled a press conference for later today. We just need to face the camera together. A beloved public servant and his devoted wife. And move on.,Robert
"All right, if I have to be the good wife, I???ll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I???m a better wife than that. [sighs]",Angela
Andy???[knocks] I need to talk to you.,Dwight
"Yeah, come on in. I???m just on hold with another talent agency. It???s insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there???s more. 251. 252. I can???t even keep up!",Andy
Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.,Dwight
[grunts intensely] I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That???s final.,Andy
"So what I???m hearing you say is, ???Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible????",Dwight
"Yes! I???m sorry I???m being curt, it???s just I???m about to land a top talent agent.",Andy
Mm-hmm. Good luck.,Dwight
[on the phone] Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.,Andy
"For five years I???ve held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it???s time for me to just let that thought go. It???s kind of painful, but it???s also freeing in a way. Now it???s all about my instincts.",Dwight
"Hey, Dwight.",Clark
"Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.",Dwight
Pass.,Stanley
"Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?",Clark
"Don???t worry, it???s just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It???s just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.",Dwight
"Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha???",Stanley
[fires tranquilizer gun at Stanley],Dwight
Holy [bleep].,Clark
"No, you didn???t. Sick of you and your???ooh???",Stanley
[fires tranquilizer gun twice],Dwight
[falls to the floor with a loud thud],Stanley
It???s all right. Andy approved it.,Dwight
"Man, he???s really in twinkle town now.",Meredith
"Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren???t those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?",Clark
"Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley???s got way more body fat than they do.",Dwight
You gave him three shots.,Clark
Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. [claps] Grab his feet. [grunts] Let???s go!,Dwight
All right.,Clark
"Move it! One, two, three. [grunts]",Dwight
"He???s like a manatee. Ready? Let???s go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! [Stanley???s head hits the door frame] Oh, God.?? No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.",Dwight
We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something.,Clark
Yes.,Dwight
"[grunts] Okay, we???re good. We???re good. Let???s go. Push!",Dwight
I am!,Clark
Any good weekend plans?,Clark
I might see a movie.,Dwight
Nice.,Clark
What about you?,Dwight
"Uh, I don???t know yet.",Clark
[grunts] Let???s take him???,Dwight
I was thinking about???,Clark
"Let???s go right to the top of the stairs, okay?",Dwight
And then what?,Clark
"Okay, listen. I???m kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I???ve never actually done this before.",Dwight
"Well, if I may, you???re a natural.",Clark
"Thank you. I mean, I???ve rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh???",Dwight
That???s a little weird.,Clark
I know. Evel Knievel.,Dwight
[wraps tape around Stanley???s body],Dwight
[connect helmet straps around Stanley???s head] That???s about as good as that???s gonna be.,Clark
"Okay, now here???s the plan. I???m gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.",Dwight
Catch?,Clark
Yeah.,Dwight
"I can???t catch him. He???s like, 250 pounds.",Clark
"You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He???s gonna be moving slowly. It???s only???",Dwight
Blunt?,Clark
"It???s 15 feet down, it???s at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it???s like your catching a medicine???",Dwight
"Dude, this size of my haunches??? [Stanley???s body slips down the stairs and his head thumps into a wall]",Clark
Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.,Dwight
"We should probably call a doctor or something, dude.",Clark
[slides down the stairs and lands next to Stanley] You okay?,Dwight
"So how does it work? It???s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or???",Jim
You???re really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.,Toby
Mm-hmm.,Jim
"He might start by asking each of you, ???Why do you think you???re here????",Toby
"He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he??shouldn't??be rewarded for that.",Pam
"If I didn???t do certain things without telling Pam, she???d be married to Roy. [chuckles]",Jim
"I feel like he???s always making these decisions for the family, and then I???m left playing catch-up.",Pam
"If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I???this will be so huge for our family.",Jim
"Well, what???s a little while?",Toby
What do you mean?,Jim
"I mean, what???s the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn???t know when it???s gonna end.",Toby
That???s kind of an impossible question.,Jim
"Oh, guys, it???s starting! Hurry!",Erin
"Ooh, there???s Angela! I work with her!",Kevin
"Huh, yeah. [chuckles] I mean, I???m happy Angela???s the first one getting famous, but it???s a little weird, no? I mean, she can???t sing or act, so it???s actually kind of insane, if you think about it.",Andy
Her hair looks beautiful.,Phyllis
"Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin??? movie star! [kicks trash can]",Andy
Andy!,Erin
[on the computer screen] I would just to start by saying that there have been some rumors about my personal life that I would like to settle once and for all. As my long-suffering wife can attest??? I am gay.,Robert
[surprised chatter],Crowd
"Senator, were always gay, or did your wife turn you gay?",Reporter #1
Question for the Senator???s beard.,Reporter #2
[on the computer screen] I???ll say it again for mis amigos latinos. Yo soy homosexual.,Robert
Poor Angela.,Pete
Yeah. Poor Angela.,Phyllis
I once believed that a gay person could be somewhat straight. It wasn???t until my marriage to Angela that I realized how???charmless I find the female body.,Robert
Oof. Always hurts to hear that one.,Meredith
There???s someone else I need to thank. His name is Oscar Martinez.,Robert
Come on!,Andy
Oscar is the one who opened my eyes to who I really am. For the first time???,Robert
Oscar is with the Senator too?,Erin
"Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn???t know, you didn???t know, and you didn???t freaking know. But I knew! [claps]",Kevin
He knew!,Oscar
"Yes, we did it!",Kevin
"You did it, Kevin.",Oscar
"Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.",Kevin
"--with this new self-awareness, I was finally able to find love at long last. With my amazing??? Chief of Staff Wesley Silver.",Robert
What?!,Oscar
Wesley Silver???s gay?,Creed
[surprised chatter],Crowd
[gasps],Angela
Ohh.,Kevin
They make a nice couple.,Creed
[gags],Angela
Almost there. Almost there. [opens car door] Okay. We???re running late. Let???s get him inside.,Dwight
We can???t just leave him bubble wrapped like this.,Clark
Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that???s stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.,Dwight
That???s actually really smart.,Clark
Thank you.,Dwight
"God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.",Clark
Let???s get him inside.,Dwight
"Carla Fern is not just an actor???s agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate.",Andy
Actor?,Andy
"Oh, no. [chuckles] Well, I have an act. Dog, cat, mouse.",Man
"Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that?",Andy
"Eh, you go through a lot of mice.",Man
"If started by accident as these things tend to do. You know, I was setting down my cat, and I accidently put her on top of my dog, and I was, like, so mad at myself at first. And then I was, like, wait. Wait a second.",Man
Does anything go on top of the mouse?,Andy
Yeah. Little hat.,Man
"Aw, that???s cute.",Andy
Yeah.,Man
What???s the mouse???s name?,Andy
"Eh, you know, it really doesn???t make sense to name the mice. They???re kinda like cannon fodder, you know? You???re not one of those PETA guys , are you? [cat jumps off dog] Oh, great.",Man
"Hey, wait, wait, how???how are we doing this?",Clark
"Well, I???ll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.",Dwight
"Just say ???arms??? and ???legs,??? okay? That just???that???s the vernacular that I???m comfortable with.",Clark
"Fine, let???s go. [grunts]",Dwight
[sighs],Clark
Hoist his shank on three.,Dwight
Wha???What???s a shank?,Clark
It???s by the tenderloin.,Dwight
"Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he???s slouching. Okay, can you???sl-slouch him into the seat. [sighs] Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt. [grunts]",Dwight
All right.,Clark
Got it?,Dwight
Yeah???yup yup.,Clark
[grunts and closes car door] Get in the back.,Dwight
What?,Clark
Get in the back.,Dwight
"Aw, come on.",Clark
Get in.,Dwight
Damn it.,Clark
"Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we???re about to do?",Dwight
Helllloooo!,Stanley
"Okay. We, hey???hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay?",Clark
Pigeons.,Stanley
"Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we???ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.",Dwight
"Isn???t the client, like, best friends with his sister?",Clark
"New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let???s go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let???s go.",Dwight
"I???m sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don???t want him to do it anymore, and I don???t want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly.",Pam
"Well, if Pam says she won???t go, then???[chuckles] we???re gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.",Jim
That was exhausting.,Nellie
Blah blah blah blah. Jim.,Toby
"Well, they deserve each other, then.",Nellie
They do. That they do.,Toby
That is for sure.,Nellie
[whispers] That they do.,Toby
"And for???oh, whoopsie daisy. [chuckles]",Dwight
"Stanley, what is going on here?",Mrs. Davis
He???s fine. He gets carsick really easily.,Dwight
Driving.,Clark
"It???s a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we???re talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?",Dwight
"Ooh-hoo, look at that baby???",Stanley
Stanley.,Dwight
Ohhh???,Stanley
That???s Benji in the middle.,Mrs. Davis
"That???s Benji. Oh, he???s precious. That???s a healthy-looking baby.",Stanley
Very special little boy.,Mrs. Davis
Look at him. I???ve never seen such a beautiful child.,Dwight
"Funny sense of humor. If you push on his nose, he???ll go, ???eee.???",Mrs. Davis
Like this? Watch.,Dwight
Eee.,Stanley
[laughs],Everyone
Like that.,Mrs. Davis
A beautiful family.,Stanley
[laughs] Right? Come on!,Dwight
"Yeah, maybe I???ll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it???s the most pleasant I???ve ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.",Dwight
"So, what can you do?",Carla
"[Australian accent] Well, what can???t I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn???t noticed, I???ve got a pretty good British accent.",Andy
Can you drive a car?,Carla
"At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here.",Andy
"Why do you have, uh, a high school musical here on your resume? What are you, like, 40? 45?",Carla
"My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal???s going out on.",Andy
"Gyllenhaal, got it. Can you juggle and crap?",Carla
: Yes. And yes. [chuckles],Andy
"Would you dress up as, say, a birthday clown and go to a kid???s party, let ???em throw pies at ya?",Carla
"Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility. [sniffs] I???m all for it.",Andy
"Well, Mr. Bernard, I???m gonna be honest with you.",Carla
"Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.",Andy
"Uh, no. We???re???we???re gonna take you on as a client.",Carla
"You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me.",Andy
"We are extremely excited to be working with you too, sir. Pay Todd on your way out.",Carla
"Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots.",Andy
"Uh, it doesn???t include headshots.",Todd
It doesn???t include headshots.,Andy
No.,Todd
"Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though.",Andy
"So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?",Stanley
"You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn???t even know it. I???ll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. [chuckles] Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.",Dwight
"Oh, no, I???m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.",Stanley
"Well???no, no???n???",Dwight
[stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground],Stanley
[stomps on the ground] We need a winch and a hoist.,Dwight
"Oh. Hey, champions.",Erin
Good morning.,Toby
Quater finals in an hour. Hope you got some sleep cause I am going to be haunting your nightmares tonight.,Clark
I did. I got some really good sleep.,Erin
Did you? [pushes pencil cup at Erin],Clark
[grabs pencils out of cup quickly as cup falls] Bzzz.,Erin
"Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest. It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. [whispers] Practically made of plastic.",Dwight
"We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill [cut to Kevin flying paper airplane], others relied on showmanship [cut to Dwight throwing airplane at Nate with an apple on his head] others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is. [cut to Creed throwing a melon] And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster.",Nellie
"Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep. [Pam's plane hit Toby in the eye]",Toby
Ow! Ow!,Toby
I didn't see you! You should have yelled ???Crossing!???,Pam
[crying] I'm sorry!,Toby
"Ok, so is that my spot?",Pam
"We are now down to an elite eight. Well, seven and Toby.",Nellie
"[Reading from script] Be careful of that beaker, it contains dangerous acid!",Andy
It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.,Darryl
Well I'm just trying to bring some life to it.,Andy
"Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols. It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brother's Brad Pitt. And boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs Two.",Andy
Andy?,Toby
"Go away, we're running lines.",Andy
You wanted to see the gooey eye.,Toby
"Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. [moves to lift Toby's eye patch] Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go.",Andy
"Alright, it's getting gooier so we'll just do it later.",Toby
"Yeah, Ok. [Closes door] Alright. Where were we?",Andy
Something full of acid.,Darryl
And remember: Do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water. You will only exacerbate the flame. The dangerous flame.,Andy
"[claps] That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here.",Darryl
W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere. I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times.,Andy
Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.,Jim
Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.,Pam
"So, we had couple's therapy.",Pam
No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.,Jim
And we have homework.,Pam
"Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.",Jim
And we're also supposed to speak our truths.,Pam
Mmhm.,Jim
"Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy.",Pam
"Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do ???opportunities.???",Jim
"Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, let's get it done tomorrow. Carla Fern got me a gig.",Andy
Hey!,Pam
Yeah.,Andy
Who's Carla Fern?,Stanley
"Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator.",Andy
Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.,Oscar
Little raw. Not cool Oscar.,Andy
But you just!,Oscar
Not cool.,Andy
"Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds.",Nellie
"Who's pumped for the quarter finals, huh?",Robert
I'm pumped!,Dwight
Clark's a dead man.,Erin
"Alright. Sounds like somebody wants to walk away with this. [holds up large check for $2,000]",Robert
Oh my god!,Angela
Whoa.,Group
Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.,Angela
"Oh yes I did, I told you all. It was..um, cause that's an awful lot of money for me to forget.",Nellie
Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.,Stanley
I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense.,Nellie
"Nellie, this is a competition. Please take it seriously.",Erin
Oh please. [Dwight watches Angela folding paper airplane],Nellie
"Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator. But my new studio apartment is just fine [camera shows small cluttered space with excessive cats and Phillip crying] for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.",Angela
[cries],Phillip
"Come here, come here. Let's go.",Angela
"I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.",Angela
"I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now. She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.",Dwight
"Oh, wide wings, interesting.",Clark
Hey. Why don't you back off?[looks at Pete]...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.,Erin
"Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.",Erin
Are you in that paper documentary too?,Carla Fern
Yep.,Darryl
Do you need an agent?,Carla Fern
"No. He's- I mean, you've never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage.",Andy
I was in The Whiz in high school.,Darryl
That's the cleaky clacker! He clicks that and then the guy says ???action.???,Andy
"Hey, I made them get you a chair. All my clients sit.",Carla Fern
Can I take your picture?,Woman
"I guess it's starting. Um, yeah. Of course. Yeah sure. Tell you what. I'll put my arm around you and then I can take it-",Andy
We just need a picture of the top of your head in case we burn some of your hair off.,Woman
"Got it. [lowers head to show hair, but keeps looking up just as she tries to take the picture]",Andy
"No, if you could just keep it down until..",Woman
Sorry.,Andy
"OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. Kevin versus Angela.",Nellie
Yes!,Kevin
"Hey, that is a really nice plane. You make that yourself?",Dwight
Uh huh.,Kevin
"Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.",Dwight
Of course.,Kevin
"Kevin, did you make that yourself?",Nellie
Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.,Kevin
Oh man.,Nellie
I call for a refold!,Dwight
No.,Kevin
Really? [to Dwight] Thank you.,Angela
This is flatter.,Kevin
It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.,Dwight
"Ok, that's enough. This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one.",Nellie
"I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.",Kevin
You have to choose one now.,Nellie
"Fine. [throws plane, doesn't fly]",Kevin
Angela advances.,Nellie
Nice.,Erin
[clapping] Whoo!,Dwight
Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.,Angela
I'm not giving up. I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.,Kevin
An Earl Grey tea for the lady.,Jim
"Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.",Pam
"Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.",Jim
"Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March. There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.",Pam
We are rolling and...action!,Director
"[Happily] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death.",Andy
"Ok, um, stop. Um, why are you smiling so much?",Producer
Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job.,Andy
"Ok, well maybe no smiling on this one.",Director
"So how do you want, how should I do it?",Andy
"I don't know, just like you're reporting the news or something. Ok?",Director
[ridiculous news voice] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols.,Andy
Ok.,Director
"It's Tom Brokaw, it's a newscaster.",Andy
Who was that?,Director
Tom Brokaw!,Andy
Come on Clark!,Dwight
"Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther]",Angela
Whoa!,Dwight
Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!,Erin
"We've still gotta work together, so we should keep it civil.",Clark
"[Snorts and grunts] I can't hear what you said. [snorting, grunting] You got your slop? [Squeals]",Erin
"You know what, this is completely unnecessary. You already won...",Clark
Erin! Erin! Just stop.,Pete
What?,Erin
Relax.,Pete
Next up we have Dwight and Phyllis.,Nellie
You can do it baby!,"Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration"
"No you can't baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck.",Angela
Watch and learn.,Dwight
Wow.,Erin
Oh!,Group
"Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals.",Nellie
Yes!,Dwight
Whoo!,Angela
"Oh, Esther.",Dwight
Hey.,Esther
What are you- [Esther kisses him] You're here early.,Dwight
"Yeah, I plucked the chickens extra fast cause I knew I was seeing you tonight. There might just be a little feather in your nuggets or a little bit of meat inside of your pillow.",Esther
I like a little feather in my nuggets. [both laugh],Dwight
"Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, Angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars.",Nellie
Yeah!,Erin
"Ok here you have just knocked over the beaker, the chemicals splashed in your eye.",Director
Which is insanely painful.,Andy
Yeah.,Director
"And I've already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain.",Andy
"That's great. So what you're gonna do then is come over here to the eye washing station and then just kinda flush out your eyes. You know, get the chemicals out. Alright?",Director
So I just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later?,Andy
What water special effect?,Director
"Yeah, yeah just hold your lids open with one hand and let the stream bathe your eyeballs.",Producer
"I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to, I'll go full Lena Dunham but I-",Andy
"Dude, we don't need you to go nude, OK? So just do the eyewash, Ok? That's all we're asking.",Director
"Darryl, what do I do?",Andy
"Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope.",Darryl
They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene.,Andy
So?,Darryl
I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball. I've never even used an eye dropper.,Andy
"So Andy, so you know how to use this. You step on the pedal, water squirts in your eyes.",Production Assistant
Carla! Carla!,Andy
It is time for a little T & A. I give you: Toby and Angela.,Nellie
[throws plane far] Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.,Angela
"Well, Angela is the winner.",Nellie
Yes!,Angela
[to Dwight] Is there a reason that we're excited for that little woman?,Esther
"Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.",Dwight
Oh. Is she a gambler?,Esther
"In a way. But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.",Dwight
Hmm. That is sad.,Esther
"[grabs Andy by the cheeks] Andy! If you don't stick your eyes in that machine, I'm going to call every production in North Eastern Pennsylvania. You won't even make an appearance on a security camera! [Andy starts to cry]",Carla Fern
What's the hold up here?,Producer
The actor's crying.,Director
Oh god.,Producer
She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't.,Andy
Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.,Darryl
Do you believe in me?,Andy
I believe I want to go home.,Darryl
"[throws plane far] Yeah! Ok! Beat that! [Erin throws plane, loses, Dwight laughs] Whoo! Ok.",Dwight
"Dammit! Dammit, god. [To Pete] Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I???m really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels.",Erin
Yeah. [Erin kicks box] Whoa!,Pete
Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!,Erin
"Ok [tries to help her] Hey hey hey, whoa.",Pete
Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just...,Erin
"Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.",Pam
"Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.",Jim
I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.,Pam
Thank you. Your mom is a treasure.,Jim
"Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- [Jim's phone rings, he answers]",Pam
"Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.",Jim
"Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. [Jim hangs up phone] I appreciate the sacrifice.",Pam
"Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.",Jim
"Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth?",Pam
I guess I will swallow my truth.,Jim
"Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds.",Clark
We're not high.,Pam
I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up.,Pam
The Mark 47 is ready for launch. [throws plane but it sticks to his hand] Less paste.,Kevin
Here we go. Rolling and... action!,Director
[doing eyewash] AHHH! AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!!,Andy
And cut. We can fix the sound in post.,Director
Yeah.,Producer
I can do a better one.,Andy
"That's fine, we'll move on.",Producer
I said I can do a better one. Darryl...,Andy
Action!,Darryl
[eyewashes again] AHH! AHH! AHH!,Andy
Kid can act!,Carla Fern
Yeah! Yeah.,Andy
Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes.,Nellie
After you.,Dwight
Thank you. [plane loops up and falls at her feet] Oh god!,Angela
"Angela's first throw, terrible. Dwight.",Nellie
"[fake throws and drops plane] Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. [Angela smiles]",Dwight
We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely. [Angela looks disgusted],Esther
Alright.,Dwight
"Don't you dare tank this. [Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane]",Angela
And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over.,Nellie
Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me.,Creed
"[To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.",Angela
"I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok.",Angela
"I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?",Jim
Ok. [intense moment where Jim leaves and Pam seems conflicted. She notices his umbrella and runs out to follow him],Pam
Jim! [hands him umbrella],Pam
Thanks.,Jim
"Alright, have a good trip.",Pam
Bye.,Jim
Bye. [walks away],Pam
"Hey! [Runs after her and looks into her eyes] I... [hugs her tightly, Pam doesn't hug back]",Jim
"[Flashback to Jim & Pam's wedding] Love suffers long and is kind. It is not proud. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. [Pam hugs Jim back finally] And now these three remain: Faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. [Pam kisses Jim]",Pastor
I love you.,Pam
I love you.,Jim
"I???m taking some time off from work???well, my other work???because we needed it.",Jim
It???s great.,Pam
It???s great.,Jim
The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.,Pam
But that doesn???t matter. This does. It???s the only thing that matters. We???ve had some really nice days together.,Jim
"Nice morning, too.",Pam
"Beesly! Oh, my god.",Jim
Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent???s putting me up for a furniture commercial.,Andy
"Ah, definitely blue.",Jim
"Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what???s up? Back in the small pond?",Andy
"For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin???",Jim
Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.,Andy
"Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can???t give 100% to two things at once you know.",Jim
"Tell me about it, you know? I???ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don???t know if I???m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.",Andy
"Huh. Well, you know, you can???t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what???s most important. That???s my new thing.",Jim
[noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?,Oscar
No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.,Angela
"Wait, all of them?",Kevin
"Two sacks??? worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.",Angela
"That???s???that???s awful, Angela. I???m so sorry.",Oscar
"It???s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She???s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.",Angela
I???ve never met anyone like that.,Kevin
"And they???re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.",Angela
"Angela, you still have your son.",Oscar
I guess.,Angela
"Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and???",Dwight
Smasher!,Jim
"Smasher? No, where???d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city???s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.",Dwight
"I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don???t spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.",Dwight
"I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.",Dwight
Fireball!,Jim
Ah! [throws punch] That???s how it???s done.,Dwight
That???s pretty good. I feel safe.,Jim
"Hey, Erin. Is Andy in?",David Wallace
"Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said ???is Indian??? and was like, ???Is Indian what???? Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.",Erin
"Lately, I???ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy???s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.",Erin
"Yes, there???s Andy! Andy is in. I???m a good receptionist, I know he???s in.",Erin
"David Walrus, in his native habitat.",Andy
"Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?",David Wallace
Yeah.,Andy
"This isn???t going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, ???The kind that???s good for head shots.??? And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it???s gonna boost office morale. Now, he???s a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired.",David Wallace
Andy???,David Wallace
"I???m gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it???s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream.",Andy
"Uh-huh, but???",David Wallace
"Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I???ll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense.",Andy
So you think you???ve been too focused on your job?,David Wallace
"At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany.",Andy
So you???you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?,David Wallace
"Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don???t???it just??? I owe it to myself and my future fans.",Andy
"Uh, well, I guess I can???t stand in the way of a man???s dream. And it seems like you have the gift.",David Wallace
"Thank you, David.",Andy
"There???s probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?",David Wallace
Nope. I have made up my mind. I???m really sorry.,Andy
"Well, good luck.",David Wallace
Thank you. Not gonna need it.,Andy
Okay.,David Wallace
Well that kind of worked out.,David Wallace
"I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.",Creed
"Oh, Clark. I???m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.",Jim
"Right. Yeah. But, you know, I???ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I???ve earned this. I mean, you know?",Clark
You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I???m here.,Jim
"Right. Well, I???m here to sell paper.",Clark
Wow.,Pam
"All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And???and Wallace is here today. And I don???t him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?",Clark
it???s okay. You can sit in the annex.,Pam
What?,Jim
I???ll come visit you.,Pam
Okay. The annex it is. I???ll be sitting at your desk if that???s okay with you.,Jim
"That???s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete???s beautiful, dead eyes.",Clark
"Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I???m taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever.",Andy
"I can???t say we didn???t see it coming. But it???s a sad day when anybody is fired. We???re so sorry, Andy.",Oscar
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired.",David Wallace
"I wasn???t fired. What are you talking about? I???m fired up, yes. Guys, I???m???I???m leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous.",Andy
"Oh, Andy.",Pam
"Yeah, so, I???ll see you on the red carpet. See, that???s how it works.",Andy
Andy sings beautifully. And he???s really good at dancing. He???s a good speaker. But there???s just something there you don???t want to look at.,Phyllis
"Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.",Jim
"Yeah, a little bit.",Pete
"Oh, wow. But, um???Oh, I get that.",Jim
"Oh, no, no, no. No it???s cool.",Pete
I get it.,Jim
"It???s cool, man. I???m sure you and I will have our own thing.",Pete
"Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don???t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.",Jim
I just think you???re going into this a little fast.,Darryl
"I???m 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?",Andy
"Show business is cold. Let???s say you get a job, which you probably won???t. They???re not gonna cut you any slack. You???re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.",Darryl
All right. I get it.,Andy
"The male is a funny species. We don???t just tell each other how we feel, that???s chick stuff. So instead of saying, ???Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don???t want you to leave.??? You say something like, ???Hey, Andy, you???re making the worst mistake of your life. You???re not talented.??? Well??? right back at you, Darryl.",Andy
[hugs Darryl] I???m gonna miss you too. Mmm!,Andy
"Andy???s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?",Stanley
"Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don???t know. You know who???s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can???t fly right. I???d pay to see him. But I don???t have to cause the park is free!",Kevin
I will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts.,Sensei
He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!,Dwight
"It???s not a large room, I think they heard me.",Sensei
"Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. [thrusts hips at Ira]",Dwight
That???s really ok. I???m mostly focused on the belt here.,Sensei
Just slip it off my???Slip it off my hips.,Dwight
"Hold it???Take a step back. Take a step back. [they bow, then Dwight thrusts again] Okay, okay. I can???t???I can???t do this if you???re gonna be thrusting like that, okay? I think we???re gonna have to cut this off.",Sensei
He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.,Dwight
"Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.",Angela
There it is. [everyone applauds],Dwight
Congratulations.,Sensei
"We did it, we did it. I love you.",Dwight
Okay.,Sensei
Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You???re gonna watch me right?,Dwight
"Yes, I will. [Dwight starts doing karate]",Sensei
"Sensei, you???re not watching.",Dwight
"Yeah, I???m watching. Just do it.",Sensei
Watching?,Dwight
I???m watching.,Sensei
"Watch this part, okay?",Dwight
"Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?",David Wallace
"Uh, you can just call me Billy. And no. No, but Dwight insisted. He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world.",Sensei
"He said that? He???s an odd guy, isn???t he?",David Wallace
"Yes. Irritating, also yes. But I gotta hand it to him, he???s one of the most tenacious and determined men I???ve ever met. [Dwight finishes his routines and everyone applauds]",Sensei
"Oh! I???m am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue.",Esther
"I really felt like I almost lost her, and???and nothing is worth that.",Jim
"Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn???t even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.",David Wallace
"Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.",Clark
You did not just say that! You don???t know Pam. She is really cool.,Dwight
"All I???m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager???s chair. And I thought you wanted that job.",Clark
"Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It???s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I???d be happy to see Jim as manager.",Dwight
"So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.",David Wallace
Again.,Jim
"Again! And I???m looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?",David Wallace
Not at all. It should be Dwight.,Jim
You sure?,David Wallace
"You???re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh???",Jim
Yeah.,David Wallace
"Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don???t want to meet that person.",Jim
"Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.",Nellie
It???s now or never.,Andy
"Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive.",Nellie
"Yeah, sure. What???s your question?",Andy
Our question is???it seems dumb.,Kevin
"Well, it???s better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?",Andy
"Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and ???full-ass??? it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?",Nellie
Nah. I like my plan better.,Andy
"Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You???re too character-y to be a lead and you???re not fat enough to be a great character actor.",Kevin
What?,Andy
"No, I don???t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can???t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?",Oscar
"Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?",Jim
Yes. Yeah.,Pam
"I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.",Jim
"Oh, boy. Um???",Pam
"If you could help me out, that would be???",Jim
I could give you some beginner stickies?,Pam
Anything would help.,Jim
Here you go.,Pam
"Oh, also, while you???re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.",Jim
Mm-hmm.,Pam
"Wow, that???s???",Jim
It???s all yours.,Pam
You come so prepared. Aspirin.,Jim
"You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.",Dwight
"Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It???s really great.",Jim
Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager???s job?,Dwight
No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.,Jim
"Yeah, right. I???m afraid that ship has sailed.",Dwight
I wouldn???t be too sure about that. Just saying.,Jim
Hello.,Dwight
"Well, hello.",Andy
Big day for you.,Dwight
Big day for you.,Andy
Thank you.,Dwight
Love the belt.,Andy
"Oh, yes.",Dwight
"You know, I don???t know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog???s outta here, so letting it all hang out!",Andy
This is exciting! You???re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.,Dwight
"Thank you, I appreciate that. ???Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.",Andy
"Oh, I doubt you???ll make it. Very few do who???ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you???ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?",Dwight
"No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.",Andy
"Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don???t quit your day job.",Dwight
"[cockney accent] Nothing is impossible to him who will try. [normal] Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.",Andy
You???re bad.,Dwight
I???m gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.,Andy
"Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That???s something you can???t take back.",Andy
"So true. Is there a question, or are???what?",Erin
"Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?",Andy
"Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.",Erin
Thank you. [steps into conference room],Andy
"You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.",David Wallace
Thank you. [leaves],Andy
"Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?",David Wallace
Say it again.,Dwight
Will you be the new manager?,David Wallace
Where?,Dwight
Where?,David Wallace
What branch?,Dwight
"Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let???s go. It???s good news.",David Wallace
"I???m sorry. I???ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.",Dwight
What?,David Wallace
But this isn???t interim manager. No. It???s Dwight K. Schrute??? [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.,Dwight
Why do you already have this?,David Wallace
"In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.",Dwight
I know.,David Wallace
"I will never, ever let you down.",Dwight
"I know, Dwight. I know. [reaches out to shake Dwight???s hand, Dwight hugs him] Okay. Okay. All righty. You???re gonna do great.",David Wallace
Hey.,Pam
"Wow, hey.",Jim
Hi.,Pam
What???s up?,Jim
"Um, I have a question.",Pam
Okay.,Jim
"Oh, I had a question.",Pam
Really?,Jim
I did!,Pam
"Yeah, totally you did.",Jim
Super important.,Pam
I need you to stay right here while you think about it.,Jim
Okay.,Pam
All right? I???m gonna wait.,Jim
All right. I did not come back here just to see you.,Pam
I???m sure you did not. What was your question?,Jim
"I don???t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.",Pam
"Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I???m waiting.",Jim
Exactly.,Pam
"Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I???m gonna stay on in sales.",Andy
"Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.",Nellie
"Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don???t want to see you in a porn next year.",Meredith
Okay.,Andy
"Ooh, there???s a great play about a salesman.",Kevin
Death of a salesman.,Andy
I don???t think so.,Kevin
"Sure, ???Death of a Salesman??? by Arthur Miller, it???s a great play about crushed dreams.",Andy
"No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.",Kevin
[sits at Dwight???s desk] Got any hot leads?,Andy
"See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.",Pete
I had no idea. And here I???ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin??? sheep.,Erin
Look who???s back.,Jim
"I???m back. Oh, hey, look, and now it???s like a double date.",Pam
"Wow. Cause, uh [gestures to him and Erin and then to Pam and Jim with sound effects]",Pete
"Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That???d be fun.",Erin
"Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.",Pam
"Well, how about Thursday?",Erin
"Oh, well, Thursday???s tough, because of???",Pam
Weeknights are actually tough just because???,Jim
They are.,Pam
"That???s true, yeah.",Jim
Just forget it. Forget I said anything.,Erin
"Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute???",David Wallace
"David. Can I just do one thing while you???re making this announcement and then I???ll never, ever do it again?",Dwight
I don???t think so.,David Wallace
It???s just one thing. Just let me???let me do this???,Dwight
"Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on???what I was about to say was Dwight???[phone buzzes] Oh, I???m sorry, I gotta???This???ll be a second, sorry.",David Wallace
Just wait and send it to voicemail.,Dwight
Yeah.,David Wallace
Come on. Come on.,Dwight
[on phone] Then we???ll get him a new set of drums.,David Wallace
[climbs up on desk] Dwight Schrute is manager! [everyone cheers and applauds],Dwight
"Brava, brava.",Andy
[from atop his desk] Creed Bratton is the new manager! [nobody responds],Creed
What???s going on?,Pam
Dwight???s the new manager. He freaking did it.,Kevin
"[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, Dwight.",Pam
Pam.,Dwight
"[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, buddy.",Jim
"Thank you, Jim.",Dwight
"Congrats, Dwight.",Clark
Get out of Jim???s seat.,Dwight
But I fought for this seat.,Clark
"You???re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we???ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.",Dwight
It???s nice to have you back.,Pam
So???,Dwight
So.,Jim
I wanted to offer you a new position.,Dwight
Let???s hear it.,Jim
Assistant regional manager.,Dwight
Nope. Can???t accept that job. It???s not a real job.,Jim
Jim.,Dwight
I???ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I???d be proud to take.,Jim
"Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.",Dwight
"Don???t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.",Jim
"So, all the numbers adding up?",Dwight
"Hey, I didn???t get a chance to say it, but??? congratulations, Dwight.",Oscar
Thank you.,Dwight
Yes. Congratulations.,Angela
"Yeah, and Dwight, I???d like to be the first to say congratulations.",Kevin
This is a big day for you.,Angela
"Yes, it is. Carry on.",Dwight
"How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It???s cause I had a fallback. That???s the problem. When you have fallbacks, it???s just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.",Andy
Everyone! Changed my mind again.,Andy
"What???s it now, dream or no dream?",Phyllis
"Uh, dream. Goin??? with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn???t that right, Jim?",Andy
"Oh, don???t look at me cause I think you???re making a terrible choice.",Jim
All in! Whoo!,Andy
"Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all.",Andy
"Okay, then, Andy.",Toby
"Yeah, but here???s the thing. I can???t have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I???ll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners.",Andy
"Andy, you know I can???t do that. It???d be lying.",Toby
Seriously?,Andy
"Yeah, I???m???",Toby
"Come on, just do it.",Andy
I can???t.,Toby
"All right, fine, just know that you made me do this. [starts touching Toby???s thighs]",Andy
"[fending Andy off] Oh, come on. Andy, no.",Toby
"God, Toby, don???t???stop blocking my hand.",Andy
"No, no.",Toby
This is your???you brought this on.,Andy
"No, no. Andy.",Toby
"Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!",Andy
"[answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there???s a problem it???s clearly on your end. And???oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um??? what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn???t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should???ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]",Angela
What do you think that was about?,Kevin
"David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I???d just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite.",Andy
"We put the past behind us, though, Andy.",David Wallace
What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?,Andy
"Enough, Andy. Enough!",David Wallace
"Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?",Andy
Oh my god.,David Wallace
"Eleanor Roosevelt once said ???the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.??? [clip of him flipping off David Wallace] I think she???s right. [clip of David Wallace yelling at Andy to get out] I feel calm now. [clip of Andy taking a dump on a car] I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I???m doing the right thing.",Andy
Andy.,Angela
Yeah.,Andy
What are you doing?,Angela
"Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don???t squash my knickety-knacks on top.",Andy
"Yeah, okay. That???s not what I mean. You don???t have to leave because you said you would. Don???t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It???s not worth it.",Angela
"Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too???",Andy
Ugh.,Angela
But I just???it???s in the past. And I feel like we shouldn???t???,Andy
"No, that???s not???",Angela
Rehash???,Andy
"No, none???No, stop. It???s just???",Angela
Exactly.,Andy
"Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.",Angela
"Thanks, Angela. You too.",Andy
Thanks.,Angela
"A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how.",Andy
"Oh, good lord.",Nellie
Can???t you just leave?,Stanley
"You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.",Jim
"Tuna, I???m a performer. And perform I shall. [sings ???I Will Remember You??????everyone is slightly impressed]",Andy
[whispering] You okay?,Dwight
[crying] It???s just a really nice song.,Angela
[everyone applauding] Awesome!,Kevin
Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He???s not terrible.,Phyllis
Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.,Stanley
"No, he???s good.",Phyllis
He was good.,Stanley
"Good night, Kevin.",Oscar
"Night, Oscar.",Kevin
Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.,Oscar
"Well, I???ve changed my mind.",Angela
Wait a minute. You???re not thinking of living in a???,Oscar
"Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?",Angela
"Okay, I???m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.",Oscar
"Oh, god.",Angela
Come stay with me.,Oscar
You don???t want me at your place.,Angela
I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won???t be long. It???s the least I could do.,Oscar
Well???,Angela
Separate bathrooms.,Oscar
Thank you.,Angela
You???re welcome. Let???s go get Phillip. Then we???ll get your stuff???,Oscar
Okay.,Angela
And get you the hell outta that place.,Oscar
Are you allowed to have pets?,Angela
"Oh, Angela.",Oscar
"Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.",Dwight
You talk to Wade and Colin?,Darryl
"No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What???s up?",Jim
We got an offer on the table.,Darryl
What kind of offer?,Jim
A buyout.,Darryl
What?,Jim
"We???re in play, baby.",Darryl
"Oh, my god!",Jim
"We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it???s not just a Philly play, so get this: they???re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.",Darryl
"Wow, that is??? wow.",Jim
"Yeah, we did it.",Darryl
"Yeah, we did. Hey, how long???how long do we think that???s gonna take?",Jim
Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.,Darryl
"Oh, man. Yeah, I can???t do it.",Jim
Can???t do what?,Darryl
"This, man. I can???t do this to Pam.",Jim
"No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.",Darryl
I know. And I can???t do it.,Jim
So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?,Angela
"No, it???s neat and tasteful, like most gay men???s homes. The stereotype holds up.",Oscar
I wouldn???t know. I never lived with a gay guy.,Angela
"Angela, you just were???",Oscar
[starts sobbing] I love him.,Angela
"I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You???you can???t???",Oscar
"No, not the senator. I love Dwight.",Angela
The tea in Nepal is very hot.,Erin
But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office],Kevin
"Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project: increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they???re protecting America???s real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day???s security codes. Something that???s been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It???s not the KGB, but it???s a start.",Dwight
The tea in Nepal is very hot.,Erin
But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.,Dwight
Close.,Erin
"This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?",Dwight
Colder.,Erin
The coffee in Paraguay is colder?,Dwight
"No, I meant you???re getting colder. The correct response is, ???the coffee in Peru is much hotter.???",Erin
"Ah, much, ok.",Dwight
"But, that???s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?",Erin
"No, no. Give me the steam.",Dwight
"It???s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I???d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.",Dwight
[while getting steamed] Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!,Dwight
"[carrying in clothes on hangers] Oh, I???m saving a fortune on dry cleaning.",Creed
Mama!,Philip
"Angela, someone wants you.",Oscar
"Ok, coming. Hi, baby.",Angela
"Angela???s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it???s Angela who???s living in the closet. Hey-o.",Oscar
Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.,Oscar
"Go get ???em, honey.",Esther
"Oh, don???t worry. They???ll get got.",Dwight
Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check??? on that later today. This is my grandmother???s ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother???s buttock bullet ring.,Dwight
"Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that???s premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick.",Andy
"Ok, thanks. Go ahead and get in the back of the line.",Check-in guy
Yes!,Andy
"Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America???s Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It???s a really cool show, it???s like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!",Andy
Sales form for you to sign.,Jim
"You know what to do. [waits for Jim to put form in inbox, signs it and returns it to outbox] Ok",Dwight
"Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.",Dwight
"Aw, thanks, man.",Jim
"Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we???ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War???",Dwight
No.,Jim
Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.,Dwight
Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.,Jim
"Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.",Pam
"All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.",Jim
Is that them again?,Pam
Yeah.,Jim
Maybe you should call back?,Pam
I will. I will.,Jim
"The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that???s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I???m not risking that again.",Jim
"When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he???s giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he???s certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.",Pam
Welcome.,Dwight
He welcomes you.,Jim
Please take an agenda item.,Dwight
Your agenda-taking pleases him.,Jim
"Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. ???Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.??? [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.",Dwight
"Let???s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you???re expecting a fax today, please don???t yell out, ???Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.??? Ok? That???s nonsense.",Jim
Question.,Pam
"Yes, beautiful girl in the front.",Jim
"We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they???re delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, ???Nice jugs????",Pam
That???s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?,Jim
[overlapping] Zero. No nonsense. You can???t have nonsense.,Everyone
[as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on?,Dwight
Daycare won???t take Phillip anymore.,Angela
Why?,Oscar
"Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won???t forgive. So, hi.",Angela
"Hi, buddy.",Oscar
"Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.",Dwight
"Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who???s excited?",Jim
"I???d better come out of this smelling like a rose. I???ve been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn???t for the cameras, I would???ve done some truly vulgar crap.",Meredith
"Over the course of this documentary I???ve had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble: my wife did it.",Stanley
"I???m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.",Dwight
"Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard???s. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.",Kevin
"I can???t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.",Oscar
"This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.",Creed
This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang ???I Dreamed a Dream??? from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.,Andy
"Whoo-hoo! Casey Dean! Cincinnati, Ohio! [singing] Doctor, doctor, gimme the news, I got a great Casey Dean for you.",Casey
No!,Andy
America wants it!,Casey
"No, this is my time! You don???t belt on my time! I belt on my time.",Andy
[singing] Casey Dean!,Casey
[vocalizing over her] Casey Dean!,Andy
"Man, those are some nice pipes.",Casey
Yeah.,Andy
What???s your name?,Casey
Andy. What???s yours?,Andy
Why didn???t you pack the apple snacks?,Angela
Why didn???t you pack the apple snacks?,Oscar
Guys.,Kevin
"Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.",Angela
Guys.,Kevin
Why don???t you pack it?,Angela
Guys.,Kevin
"Kevin, what?",Angela & Oscar
Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says ???bold front??? instead of ???cold front???? It???s insane.,Kevin
"Not now, Kevin. Can???t you see we???re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.",Angela
"Seriously, Kevin. I???m just gonna have to go to the store.",Oscar
"Ok, you go to the store.",Angela
"Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It???s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.",Kevin
Not now! Private time!,Dwight
I love Star Wars as much as the next guy???,Jim
"Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box]",Dwight
"My god, I???m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.",Jim
"Which is, of course???",Dwight
Potential future nonsense.,Jim
"Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.",Dwight
I???m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You???ve got a regional manager.,Jim
The power source.,Dwight
"Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.",Jim
"A loyal, but bungling apostle.",Dwight
But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?,Jim
Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.,Dwight
Exactly.,Jim
"I???d have to get some more wire and string, but it???s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?",Dwight
"Yeah, right. I mean, unless they???re willing to pass some tests.",Jim
I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?,Dwight
"Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?",Jim
"That doesn???t sound crazy, Jim. That???s the sanest thing I???ve ever heard.",Dwight
What???re you listening to?,Casey
"Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.",Andy
"Oh, sweet.",Casey
"A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch.",Andy
"What???s up, everybody? And welcome to America???s Next A Cappella Singing Sensation!",Mark McGrath
Ah! It???s Mark McGrath! Oh my god! You???re gorgeous!,Casey
"Thank you, thank you so much. And thank you for your patience. And we hope to see you guys within the next five to seven hours. Now, just to give you a couple parameters of the show, each of you will sing a song for thirty seconds, after which our judges will decide if they want you in their a cappella group. Now, each group will start with 90 singers, which will compete in a series of singing and physical challenges. Oh, and look out for that pesky mole!",Mark McGrath
There???s a mole?,Andy
"Oops. I???m not supposed to???I???m not supposed to say that. All right, no mole. Forget I said it, all right?",Mark McGrath
What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.,Andy
"Good man right there. I???ll see you guys inside. Good luck, all right?",Mark McGrath
Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me!,Andy
What? On a roll much?,Casey
I don???t know where it came from.,Andy
"That was amazing, man!",Casey
"Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.",Andy
"Yeah, you made a personal connection with him.",Casey
"I did, I felt it.",Andy
Big time.,Casey
What are you so excited about?,Pam
Nothing.,Jim
What are you up to?,Pam
"Members of the office, hear ye.",Jim
"That means ye, Plop!",Dwight
Plop? Still?,Pete
We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?,Dwight
Fine.,Pete
Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.,Jim
"Aw, heck ya!",Erin
Nice.,Pam
"You???ll always have the upper hand, when you???ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.",Dwight
"This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that???s for fueling only. No savoring.",Jim
"Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.",Dwight
He envies you.,Jim
"You don???t need to repeat right now, when I???m saying it.",Dwight
Alright.,Jim
"By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.",Jim
What up?,Darryl
What???s going on? How was the delivery?,Glenn
"Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I???m here.",Darryl
"I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.",Darryl
"A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?",Jim
"Uh, two.",Meredith
"985,000,000,000,017.00",Jim
"Not even close, Meredith. Come on!",Dwight
"Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?",Jim
Theme song from Saved by the Bell.,Pam
"Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.",Jim
"Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other???s minds. You???re trying to give your wife this job.",Dwight
"That???s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?",Jim
A horse.,Pete
"Ew, the exact opposite, actually.",Jim
What???s the opposite of a horse?,Pete
Come on.,Jim
Sea horse.,Jim & Dwight
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna???,Jim
Say that? Uncanny.,Jim & Dwight
"Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?",Jim
Yeah.,Clark
Do you want a corn dog?,Jim
I would love a corn dog.,Clark
"We???ll see. You are an assistant who???s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.",Jim
"[reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went.???",Clark
"No, no, no, no! You don???t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There???s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don???t have diplomatic relations.",Dwight
Uncanny.,Jim
"I just hope that if my buddies who are still in Afghanistan see me win, they???ll feel like anything is possible.",Soldier
"Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.",Andy
"Over at the porta-potties, they were interviewing a homeless, single mother with three kids.",Casey
What?,Andy
Yeah.,Casey
Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?,Andy
I don???t know. But I???m getting really worried here.,Casey
Me too. Hold my place in line.,Andy
Where are you going?,Casey
They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.,Andy
"Thanks, man.",Darryl
Thank you.,Hank
Yep. Take care.,Darryl
"Darryl, hey.",Pam
Hey.,Darryl
"Cool, are you coming back to say hi?",Pam
"No, no, I???m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn???t say goodbye to.",Darryl
Aha. How???s Athlead?,Pam
We livin??? like rock stars. I???m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.,Darryl
Wow.,Pam
Jim really doesn???t want to come?,Darryl
He says he doesn???t want to.,Pam
Wow. Man. I hope he doesn???t regret it.,Darryl
"Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.",Pam
"Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?",Darryl
That???s what he says.,Pam
"If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.",Darryl
"An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?",Jim
A thousand times more.,Dwight
I???ll try this one.,Phyllis
"Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.",Jim
[grabbing the coffee] Hot!,Phyllis
"Yeah. It???s real. It???s the only way you???ll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She???s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!",Jim
"[over Jim] No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?",Dwight
Look at that form.,Jim
"[running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here???s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!",Dwight
Uncanny. [everyone applauds],Jim
Darryl?! Darryl!,Erin
Whoa.,Kevin
"Oh, hey. Hey, what???s up, y???all?",Darryl
You left us without saying goodbye.,Erin
"Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody.",Darryl
Hey! No way!,Meredith
That???s totally uncool.,Kevin
Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.,Erin
I don???t think I sh-,Darryl
"Get upstairs, mister!",Erin
Yeah!,Meredith
Right. Now.,Kevin
Guess I???m going upstairs.,Darryl
"You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing???none of these people are good enough.",Jim
I know.,Dwight
"What I???m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I???ve ever said.",Jim
"Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-",Dwight
Is-,Jim
Me.,Dwight
The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.,Jim
Yes! [weak applause] Thank you.,Dwight
"I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That???s it. You look really, really good.",Jim
"Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?",Dwight
Hey.,Jim
Hey.,Pam
You all right? What???s going on?,Jim
Are you happy?,Pam
"Yes, I???m happy.",Jim
"No, I know that you???re, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.",Pam
Yeah.,Jim
And that was fun. But what about a year from now?,Pam
What?,Jim
What about five years from now?,Pam
Pam.,Jim
"Because I???m so glad you???re back, baby, but I???m just???I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you???re giving up so much.",Pam
"This was my decision, not yours.",Jim
Okay.,Pam
You didn???t force me.,Jim
I kind of forced you to do it.,Pam
You did not force me to do this.,Jim
"Yes, I did.",Pam
I don???t know how else to tell you.,Jim
I???m afraid that you???re gonna resent me and I???m afraid that???,Pam
Resent you?,Jim
This is not enough for you and I???m afraid that I???m not enough for you.,Pam
Is that really what you think?,Jim
"Not enough? I don???t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it???s against the rules but I???m gonna need a favor from you guys.",Jim
"Okay. You got it, man.",Camera Crew
I didn???t realize we were this close.,Darryl
We???re all a little hormonal with the doc airing.,Phyllis
Are you gonna come to Poor Richard???s and watch with us tonight?,Meredith
Uh??? yeah. Depending on traffic.,Darryl
He ain???t coming.,Stanley
"Oh, god!",Erin
These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.,Darryl
"Well, it???s been great.",Darryl
Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he???s gone for who knows how long.,Phyllis
Maybe forever. Anyhow???,Darryl
"Did we ever have lunch together, just???just the two of us? You know what, I???m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino???s.",Oscar
Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?,Meredith
"Oh, oh, I???m sure we did.",Darryl
"Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.",Meredith
"Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.",Clark
"Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl???s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we???ll get this started.",Erin
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that???s on me. But I???m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you???re feeling sentimental.",Darryl
You have to! [everyone grumbling],Meredith
"Hey, hey, hey. I???ll do one thing with y???all.",Darryl
Which thing?,Phyllis
"I don???t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.",Darryl
"Kevin, Kevin.",Angela
"Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]",Kevin
"Kevin, could you not do that?",Angela
"What? I???m moving the ink down in my pen, for work.",Kevin
"Here, use my pen.",Oscar
Don???t tell me what to do!,Kevin
Shhh!,Angela & Oscar
"No, I don???t need this! And you obviously don???t need me.",Kevin
"Kevin, where are you going?",Angela
Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.,Kevin
He just won???t go down. It???s as if he???s excited by all this paper.,Oscar
I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.,Angela
Smart baby. That???s the most flavorful bond.,Dwight
"Hey, what???s goin??? on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young???uns?",Andy
You???re back!,Casey
"No, it???s me, Andy!",Andy
"No, I know.",Casey
"No, no, no. I???m wearing makeup.",Andy
You did a really great job. You even look shorter.,Casey
"Oh, I took out my lifts.",Andy
Oh.,Casey
"Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.",Andy
Oh.,Casey
"All day long, it???s moo the cows and cluck the hens. Get the sheep baa-ed. Oink the pigs.",Esther
"Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip]",Dwight
"Dwight, I???m telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight?",Esther
The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.,Dwight
"[puts his grandmother???s ring away] Thank you, Esther.",Dwight
Bye.,Esther
"You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?",Jim
I need you to perform a test.,Dwight
Perform a test.,Jim
On an innocent baby.,Dwight
"Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I???m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don???t worry, he???s the best in the biz.",Jim
Damn straight.,Dwight
Unless you think he can???t handle it.,Jim
"Hey, he can handle it.",Dwight
All right.,Jim
"[holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley???s sleeping. You don???t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?",Oscar
I heard that.,Stanley
Mama.,Phillip
"Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there???s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.",Dwight
He does have a gift.,Pam

Mama.,Phillip
Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager???s office before?,Dwight
"Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It???s called ???Schrute or Consequences.??? You???re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?",Dwight
Beet.,Phillip
"Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you???re no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.",Dwight
"Sorry, folks, the judges are totally swamped. We are all done taking auditions.",Check-in guy

But thanks for coming out and be sure to watch America???s Next A Cappella Sensa???,Check-in guy

Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don???t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.,Oscar
That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he???s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.,Dwight
He???s not that smart. He doesn???t know where I hid his duck.,Kevin
"[interrupting contestant singing ???Beautiful??? by Christina Aguilera] Hi. You???re still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You???re like, my three favorite people ever.",Andy
What is this?,Santigold
"[shushing contestant] Sweetheart, you???re amazing, okay? You???re obviously gonna be on the show, so it???s someone else???s turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right, [old man voice] my name is Ezra Cornell and I???m just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart.",Andy
"No, you???re a middle-aged man with a lot of makeup on.",Aaron Rodgers
"Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.",Andy
"No, we do not want to hear you sing.",Clay Aiken
Gabriella was our last audition. Thank you. Goodbye.,Santigold
"Nope! Can???t end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss???s car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.",Andy
Flag on the play.,Aaron Rodgers
"That???s???that???s what???yeah. Okay, all right, well, here???s the song. [singing] Far above Cayuga???s waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater???",Andy
What is this song?,Santigold
Are you insane? It???s the Cornell fight song.,Andy
"Listen, all right, thank you very much, we???re not interested.",Clay Aiken
You didn???t let me finish. That???s not fair.,Andy
"Look, man, you???re not terrible. We???ve heard a lot of really good singers today and you???re just not good enough.",Aaron Rodgers
"Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that???s the show. Let me try a different song, okay?",Andy
Can he do this?,Aaron Rodgers
"[singing] Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you???re never fully dressed without a smile. [falters at the judges??? reactions] Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly???",Andy
"Look, you gotta go. [Andy falls to his knees, sobbing] You can???t just sit here and cry.",Santigold
Oh I can so just sit here and cry!,Andy
[addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.,Jim
"Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?",Oscar
Can???t hear you. I???m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?,Kevin
"Okay, I guess, it???s just that Phillip got you something.",Oscar
"Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes.",Angela
"I think there???s, like, $7 left.",Oscar
"It???s just his way of saying, ???Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.???",Angela
Phillip got this for me?,Kevin
Sure.,Oscar
That was a really cool move.,Kevin
Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That???s Kevin.,Angela
Whoa.,Kevin
Easy.,Oscar
What a chubbers. Whoa.,Kevin
"Okay, watch it.",Angela
I???m losing my balance.,Kevin
"No, Kevin, no.",Angela
"Hey, no.",Oscar
Whoa!,Kevin
No horseplay.,Oscar
Stop it.,Angela
You wanna play with the cactus?,Kevin
"No, no!",Angela
"So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we???re gonna be best friends. He???s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.",Kevin
We have our decision.,Erin
You chose one thing?,Darryl
We want to dance with you.,Erin
You want to dance?,Darryl
"One dance, all of us together.",Erin
This is what you want?,Darryl
Absolutely.,Erin
"Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we???re gonna do this right.",Darryl
"Yes! [Stanley, Creed, Meredith and Creed all cheer]",Erin
Hey. You wanted to see me?,Angela
Door. Chair. It???s about Phillip.,Dwight
I am sorry he???s here today but I had???,Angela
"I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.",Dwight
How thoughtful.,Angela
"Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let???s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man???s closet.",Dwight
"If he is your son, that???s a great plan. But he???s not. He???s not your son.",Angela
Very well.,Dwight
Can I go back to my desk now?,Angela
Yes.,Dwight
What is this?,Pam
"Well I???ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn???t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.",Jim
Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.,Dwight
"OK, I don???t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.",Jim
[throws ???now??? beanbag at Jim] Now.,Dwight
"I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.",Jim
Jim. I???m not kidding. I need you.,Dwight
Go ahead.,Pam
"Ok, um, this is??? [leaves DVD with her]???I???ll be right back.",Jim
What do we got?,Jim
I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.,Dwight
"Wow! Congratulations, that???s a really big step.",Jim
"She???s got a ton of great qualities. She???s young, she???s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we???re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn???t technically incest.",Dwight
Right in the sweet spot. I think you???re gonna be really happy.,Jim
"Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.",Dwight
[whistles] That???s a lot of pros.,Jim
"And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.",Dwight
So what is the problem?,Jim
Angela.,Dwight
"I don???t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I???ve been faced with a tough decision, there???s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.",Jim
Some sort of virus?,Dwight
Love.,Jim
Oh.,Dwight
"Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who???s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.",Jim
"You???re a good assistant, Jim.",Dwight
Not as good as you.,Jim
That???s very true. Get the hell outta here.,Dwight
You got it.,Jim
You watched it.,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
"Well, then I guess you???re ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]",Jim
What???s that?,Pam
It???s from the teapot. Everything you???ll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.,Jim
Thank you.,Pam
"Ok, everybody ready?",Erin
"Hit it, red! [???Boogie Wonderland??? by Earth Wind & Fire plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office]",Phyllis
I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I???m gonna miss these guys.,Darryl
"Ok, I???ve got my???",Oscar
"See you guys at Poor Richard???s, all right?",Meredith
"All right, Meredith.",Oscar
"Okay, bye.",Angela
See you there.,Oscar
"Bye, Phillip. High five.",Kevin
"Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother???s, and I???ll meet you at Poor Richard???s in an hour.",Oscar
Are you sure you don???t want me to drop him off?,Angela
She doesn???t know I???m living with a straight woman. I don???t want to get her hopes up.,Oscar
"All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye!",Angela
"Oh, my goodness.",Oscar
[in bullhorn] Pull over!,Dwight
Dwight?,Angela
Move to the side of the road!,Dwight
Why?,Angela
Pull over!,Dwight
"What do you???Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over]",Angela
[getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem!,Angela
"[on bullhorn still] Shut up, woman!",Dwight
Who drives like that?,Angela
Listen to me! I love you! And I don???t care that Phillip???s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!,Dwight
Can you put that down?,Angela
This expresses how loudly I love you.,Dwight
It???s too loud.,Angela
"[puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.",Dwight
"Okay, yes???yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!",Angela
I love you!,Dwight
And I lied to you.,Angela
What?,Dwight
Phillip???s your son.,Angela
What? Why would you say that???,Dwight
I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.,Angela
[excited] Get out! I???m a dad!,Dwight
You???re a dad!,Angela
"Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor???s up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can. [Dwight kisses Creed???s head] Oh!",Creed
You have to change the channel to PBS.,Erin
Yeah.,Kevin
College baseball is on.,Bartender
But there???s a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.,Erin
What???s it about?,Bartender
A paper company.,Erin
How many people want the game? [half the bar cheers] Who wants PBS? [other half cheers] Sorry. Tie means I do nothing.,Bartender
"Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.",Kevin
One more for the doc. [the office staff cheers],Andy
All right.,Bartender
Yes!,Kevin
"Hey, how was the singing show audition?",Clark
"Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal.",Andy
"Ok, thirty seconds to showtime!",Creed
I feel scared a little.,Kevin
"Yeah, I???m not ready for this.",Phyllis
No one is ready for this. You can???t be ready for this. We don???t even know what this is.,Stanley
"One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.",Oscar
Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of ???Pilot???],Jim
The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?,Dwight
We???re getting bonus footage for the DVD.,CameraMan
"pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore.",Dwight
It???ll be a pledge gift.,CameraMan
PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.,Dwight
"In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I???m getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there???s a mini-reunion. A kind of a ???where are they now??? panel at a local theatre. It???ll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven???t seen Kevin since we let him go.",Dwight
"[mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.",Dwight
"Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!",Kevin
"Ah, I???ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.",Stanley
Speech!,Meredith
No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is???for???Kevin.,Dwight
"Yes! Wait, why?",Kevin
Go ahead and just read the frosting.,Dwight
???Get out.???,Kevin
Uh-huh.,Dwight
What does that mean?,Kevin
"It???s a colloquial way of saying ???you???re fired,??? Kevin, which you are.",Dwight
"What? Dwight, you can???t do that.",Pam
The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.,Dwight
What?!,All
Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.,Dwight
Dwight???[overlapping objections],All
Based???on his merit.,Dwight
Ooh.,Oscar
Umm???.,Jim
I???m???good.,Kevin
"Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone???s ever been fired, Toby???s blocked it, so???",Pam
"Yeah. Yeah, I don???t think???",Toby
"Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here???s your cake. [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.",Dwight
[crying] At least I got chocolate.,Kevin
"I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it???s good for the environment too.",Jim
Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.,Jim
Whoo! Yeah,Crowd
[to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?,Jim
And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.,Jim
"[whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?",Pam
"[whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She???s disgusting. Those feet. They???re like the paws of an orangutan.",Angela
"I think she looks good. Now that she???s wearing sports bras, we don???t see her boobs as much.",Pam
That is all. Have a good morning.,Dwight
Thank you.,Meredith
[after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?,Dwight
[laughing] To remind you that our wedding???s gonna be wonderful.,Angela
Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.,Dwight
"D, it???s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.",Angela
"Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he???s been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him.",Dwight
I don???t???I don???t know why.,Angela
"I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band ???The Grass Roots??? in the 1960???s. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.",Dwight
"Oh, some fudge?",Phyllis
"Oh, thanks. I love your fudge.",Malcolm
Thanks.,Phyllis
I think I gained a couple of pounds since I got here.,Malcolm
"[laughing] Oh, you can afford it.",Phyllis
"After 16 years, it???s strange sitting across from somebody who isn???t Stanley. But???he???ll get there.",Phyllis
"Okay, the limo???s gonna be here at five. I need everybody to be ready ???cause I want to pack in a lot.",Jim
Party time! Whorehouse!,Zeke
"Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight???s night, okay?",Jim
"Well, you???re the bestisch mensch.",Zeke
Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He???s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I???ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight???only good surprises. ???Guten Pranken???. [chuckles],Jim
"Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won???t be necessary tonight.",Dwight
"Great, now we got three hours to fill.",Clark
"Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn???t going to show up?",Jim
"Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he???s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.",Dwight
Mose has been weird? That???s so unlike him.,Jim
"Yeah, sure, I???ll talk about it. Why not? American???s next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say",Andy
You can???t just sit here and cry.,Casey Dean
"Oh, I can so just sit here and cry!",Andy
Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.,Andy
[fake crying],Bill Hader
"Oh, Don???t. Aw, come on, Baby Wawa. Don???t be such a baby.",Seth Mayers
[crying and pouring eye drops in his eyes],Bill Hader
"Oh, No. It???s gonna be alright.",Seth Mayers
[pulling multiple tissues out],Bill Hader
It???s gonna be all right. For Weekend Update I???m Seth Meyers. That???s Baby Wawa. Good night.,Seth Mayers
[still crying] Bye!,Bill Hader
"After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. [pause] Not really my scene.",Andy
"[on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby???s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you???hold on.",Oscar
Hi. I keep seeing this symbol in the accounts from last year. It???s..it???s all over the place. I don???t know what it means.,Dakota
"That???s the reason Kevin got fired. It???s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] ???A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.??? He was home by 4:45 that day.",Oscar
"Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I???m looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can???t wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone.",Nellie
Hello! [laughing] Hello!,Toby
Oh.,Nellie
Hi! [goes to hug Nellie],Toby
No.,Nellie
Oh. [laughs nervously],Toby
How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?,Nellie
"Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?",Toby
No. And I thought I unfriended you.,Nellie
Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?,Toby
"[alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know ???cause they have to give you one month???s notice before they leave.",Toby
Hey-OH!,Andy
Andy?,Meredith
You???re back?,Oscar
Yeah.,Andy
"[whispering to Phyllis] That???s Baby Wawa, right? Oh, my God!",Malcolm
"Hey man, good to see you.",Jim
"Thank you. Yeah,",Andy
[hugging Andy]. Andy???,Phyllis
Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly.,Andy
"Andy, I???ve been worried about you. How are you?",Phyllis
A little warm.,Andy
"Poor, poor Andy.",Phyllis
[struggling] Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis.,Andy
"Hello, hello.",Darryl
Hey!,Jim
Darryl!,Meredith
Hey!,Andy
"Hey, what???s up?",Darryl
Didn???t I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?,Andy
What? Must???ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.,Darryl
Hmm.,Andy
"Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um???I didn???t call ???cause I figured you changed the number.",Darryl
No I didn???t change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.,Andy
What? Ooh!,Dwight
Surprise!,Andy
I thought you guys couldn???t come.,Dwight
"Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.",Darryl
"Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? ???Guten Prank??? number one.",Jim
You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?,Darryl
"Uh, better ask Jim.",Dwight
And Jim will say nothing.,Jim
[enters] Darryl! Andy!,Pam

"Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How???s the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.",Pam
I love it. And it???s Athleap now. And the city is amazing.,Darryl
Yeah?,Jim
"Yeah. Yeah, it???s hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are???for real.",Darryl
"Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo???s here. Let???s do this. Change if you need to.",Jim
"Whoo, whoo, whoo.",Oscar
"Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.",Pam
Yeah!,Oscar
Aw!,Andy
Woah-Oh! Haven???t been in one of these in forever.,Darryl
They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich??. I???m a man. So I???m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.,Oscar
WASSUUUUP! [laughing],Oscar
"Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn???t on the itinerary.",Dwight
Get out.,Jim
"Jim???wha??? Come on! What???what are you gonna whack me, Jim?",Dwight

"Jim, it???s fine. He???ll just get you on his cell phone and then that???ll go viral.",Andy
That happens a lot?,Darryl
"Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success.",Andy
"Well, I bet it was a smash.",Oscar
That???s how I got my new job in the admissions office.,Andy
Is that a volunteer program or???,Oscar
No. It???s a job. Things are going great.,Andy
"Let???s get a drink in you, huh?",Darryl
Yes.,Andy
Whoo-hoo. Let???s get this party started!,Meredith
Where???s my angel.,Rachel
This is my big sister Rachel.,Angela
"No, this is my big sister Angela.",Rachel

People love it.,Angela
They do.,Rachel
"[sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?",Dwight
"Hi, boys!",Stripper
Ohh???,All
Here we go!,Clark
"Oh, Thank God. We are famished!",Dwight
"Hey, did somebody order the chef special?",Stripper
Right there.,Darryl
"No, we haven???t ordered anything. No one???s even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special? [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]",Dwight
I bet you boys have a big appetite.,Stripper
"Oh, we do. So we???ll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.",Dwight
"Mm, I know what you want. I know exactly what you want.",Stripper
"Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that???s not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?",Dwight
"Ohh, shh. [places finger over Dwight???s lips]",Stripper
"Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef???s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won???t work. That???s no good.",Dwight

Angela???s special repairman is here.,Phyllis
"Wait, what is this?",Angela
Shut up. Jakey?,Meredith
Mom?,Jakey
"Wait, wait. What?",Pam
"Oh, man.",Jakey
"No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom???s not here.",Meredith
"Uh, that seems inappropriate.",Pam
"Give the good show, my little entrepreneur.",Meredith
Okay.,Jakey

"Rachel, are you all right?",Angela
I don???t know! I don???t know.,Rachel

Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela],Meredith
"Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.",Angela
Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey.,Meredith
"[Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It???s o???thank you. You know what? You don???t have to???oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It???s okay.",Angela
"Now, for the last time, I???d like a side salad with balsamic.",Dwight
"Dwight, for the last time, she???s not a waitress.",Clark
You???re telling me!,Dwight
"If you want her to leave, just tip her.",Oscar
"What for? We haven???t even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren???t deep fried, right?",Dwight
That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?,Angela
It???s just the wind.,Phyllis
Will you lock the door?,Angela
"Okay. [opens door] It???s just the wind, see? Nothing.",Phyllis
"Alright, see, you don???t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It???s the wind. Just come and shut???[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!",Angela
[screams],All
Phyllis!,Erin
What???s happening?,Rachel
"Oh, man, never thought I???d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]",Dwight
"Oh, it???s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela???s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.",Jim
Good old Mose. [laughing],Dwight
They think it was Mose.,Jim
"Oh, great. He???s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.",Dwight
What is that?,Oscar
"A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.",Dwight
Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you???d ever set foot in in this town?,Jim
Right. Which one is that?,Dwight
"Mm, hey driver. Why don???t you take us to 3030 Adams?",Jim
Is that Mose?,Jim
"Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!",Dwight
"Well, first, buy us a drink.",Mose
"If you want your bride, buy us a drink! If you want your bride, buy us a drink.",All
Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender! [Kevin turns around] Oh.,Dwight
"Well, well, well, well, well, well. That???s six ???wells.??? Did I get that number right, Dwight?",Kevin
"I heard you bought a bar, Kevin.",Dwight
Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!,Kevin
[to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim],Dwight
Ooh.,Jim
You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.,Dwight
"Nope, not a prank. I think it???s time for you to bury the hatchet.",Jim
Waste of a good hatchet.,Dwight
"Okay, just talk.",Jim
"Well, w???",Kevin
I heard you say ???well??? the first time.,Dwight
I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow???s his wedding day. You can???t be anything but happy on your wedding day.,Jim
It was nothing personal. It???s just that you were terrible at your job.,Dwight
You???re just saying that to make me feel better.,Kevin
"No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.",Dwight
Is that all it was?,Kevin
That???s it.,Dwight
Come here [hugs Dwight],Kevin
I missed you Kevin.,Dwight
I missed you!,Kevin
Ohh.,Dwight
Guten Prank.,Mose
"Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.",Jim
You???ve had your drink. Now where is my bride?,Dwight
"Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk]",Dwight
What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!,Angela
"Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or???",Jim
No. We can???t see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.,Dwight
Right.,Jim
Hey guys.,Stanley
Stanley!,All
How???s Florida?,Erin
"Oh, great.",Stanley
"Yes, I???m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.",Stanley
Am I the only one that???s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?,Jim
"No, no, I???m fine.",Pam
Doesn???t seem like anyone cares about us anyway.,Jim
I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.,Stanley
I???m sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.,Andy
[watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It???s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.,Kevin
"[laughing] Yeah, people hate you.",Kevin
I???ll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home. [walks down the hall],Andy
Hey! It???s Andy Bernard!,Man
Nard Dog! [cheers and claps] Ree-De-De-De-Doo! [repeats],All
Ree-De-De-De-Doo!,Andy
How did it feel to see your lives played out on tv?,Man 1
"It???s like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It???s kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn???t wanna know any of it.",David Wallace
With today???s modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it???s our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.,Dwight
"Uh, no one recognizes me. But not all my friends call me Plop. So??? thanks PBS.",Pete
"Uh, Jim, that DVD in the last episode was so romantic. And, um, I think we???d all love to know, Pam, what romantic thing did you do to pay Jim back for leaving Athlead?",Woman 1
"Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don???t know. I???m working on something.",Pam
She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that???s fine.,Jim
Awww.,All
O-Kay.,Jim
"All I can say is, if I had Jim, he would have a free pass to do anything. I mean if I lucked into that??? he could do anything. Anything.",Woman 2
[pause] I???m sorry. Is there a question?,Pam
"Uh, no.",Woman 2
"Pam, what was in that teapot letter?",Man 2
"Oh, um, well, you know, I??? I just??? I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you???d been filmed for nine years of your life, there???d be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.",Pam
I hear ya. What did it say?,Man 2
We???re gonna move on. Next question please.,Moderator
Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody???s actually filming you anymore?,Man 3
Yes.,Toby
I wanna know how everyone felt they were portrayed. Was it accurate?,Woman 3
"I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn???t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.",Meredith
"I have a question for Jim and Pam. Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how you???re soul mates. So, Pam, how could you doubt that when Jim moved to Philadelphia?",Woman 4
"Um, you know what, I actually didn???t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.",Jim
"Listen, um??? I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn???t want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he???s shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it???s better than a fairy tale. It???s like a long book that you never want to end. And you???re fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.",Pam
Like Harry Potter.,Woman 4
"Yeah, like Harry Potter.",Pam
I have a question for Erin.,Joan
Really?,Erin
"Yes. Um, the thing I found most compelling about the documentary was your search for your birth mother.",Joan
Thank you.,Erin
"So my question is, um, do??? don???t you hate her? I mean, I would just imagine that you were so angry at her that you would hate her.",Joan
"Maybe sometimes. But not like ???hate??? hate. More just like, ???Mom, I hate you!??? And then she would say ???go to your room, young lady.??? And I???d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we???d just have dinner together. But I don???t know. I???d have to meet her. Thanks.",Erin
Erin???,Joan
Yes?,Erin
"Um???Oh, Erin..",Joan
Yes? Is there a follow-up question? [realizes] Mom? [they hug],Erin
Erin??? Same question but about your dad? [they hug],Ed
"Well, this feels like a good place to stop. Let???s thank all of our wonderful panelists for being here on this wonderful panel today. [audience claps] Next week at the Scranton Cultural Center don???t forget, Irish Step Dancing semifinals. Winning team to Mid-Atlantic. [applause and scattering cheers]",Moderator

"Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?",Kelly
"No, this little guy is mine.",Ryan
"So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals]",Ryan
"Say ???hi???, Drake.",Ryan
Drake is your baby???s name?,Kelly
Yeah.,Ryan
That is an amazing name. I???m obsessed with Drake. His last album??? it just touched me to pieces.,Kelly
"No Kelly, he???s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It???s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.",Ryan
"Cool. Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I???m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.",Kelly
"They???re called premature, sweetie. It???s good to see you again Ryan.",Ravi
Let me help you us.,Phyllis
Thanks. [knees buckle] Oh. Ouch.,Angela
"Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.",Pam
"No, my heels aren't too high. It???s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn???t know. As long as I can get to the altar.",Angela
"Oh, I???m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.",Phyllis
You ready?,Jim
[chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars],Dwight
"Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um??? I don???t know how to tell you this, but??? we have a little bit of a problem.",Jim
"Oh, no. What?",Dwight
The minister just told me that it???s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.,Jim
"Oh, come on. I???ve never heard of such a thing.",Dwight
"I haven???t heard of it, obviously. But I???m out because I am significantly younger than you-",Jim
Not??? significant is a big word???,Dwight
"I think it???s definitely??? Well, okay. Either way???",Jim
I think you???re only a teeny???,Dwight
"Either way, Dwight??? I can???t be there for you. I???m sorry.",Jim
Jim.,Dwight
I just???really wish there was something I could do. [looks off],Jim
[turns around] [whispering] Michael. I can???t believe you came.,Dwight
That???s what she said.,Michael
Best prank ever.,Jim
"As it is traditional to the Schrutes, the lovers are standing in their own graves as a reminder that this is the only escape from what they are about to do.",Minister
"[to Joan] See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?",Nellie
"[reading] ???Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. ???",Kevin
I now pronounce you man and wife. [everyone cheers] Release the doves! [doves do not move right away],Minister
Oh.,Kelly
That???s not???,Kevin
"Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They???ll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab ???em on in there.",Dwight
Everybody!,Dwight
"[dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don???t owe me anything.",Jim
Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he???s hot.,Ryan
"Oh, no.",Ravi
I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?,Ryan
"Oh, yeah, you???re not feeling well little guy? Okay, sure. Should we go inside?",Ravi
"Actually, could you go inside? I???m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.",Ryan
Are you sure you don???t wanna go in?,Ravi
"Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn???t this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.",Kelly
Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.,Ryan
"I don???t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn???t look so good.",Kelly
He???ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He???s allergic but he???ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.,Ryan
You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss],Kelly
Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.,Pam
"[with Michael] Oh, my gosh, it???s choreographed!",Pam
He just so happy to have a family plan.,Pam
Where???d you learn to dance like that?,Ed
I don???t know. I???ve just always been really good at dancing.,Erin
[dancing with Pam] [sobbing],Toby
Is it me? Is it Nellie?,Pam
[sobbing] It???s everything.,Toby
[dancing with Stanley] I missed you.,Phyllis
I missed you too.,Stanley
Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson???s a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It???s me. It???s me.,Phyllis
I love you.,Ryan
[laughing] I love you too.,Kelly
We???re gonna be together forever.,Ryan
We???re running off into the sunset.,Kelly
I finally mastered commitment.,Ryan
[to Oscar] What was that stuff?,Kevin
"Hey, has anyone seen Ryan??? or Kelly?",Ravi
"Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.",Kevin
"Oh, that???s it. Here. [hands Drake to Kevin] Call child services and report an abandoned baby. We???ll find a better parent than Ryan in no time.",Ravi
"Oh, I don???t know.",Kevin

Good night.,Dwight
Good luck.,Toby
Great. It was really fun.,Val
Good evening.,Dwight
The Doc crew???s throwing a big after party in the warehouse tonight.,Val

"Oh, I don???t know. I might turn in early.",Toby
"It???s only 6:00. Come on, everybody???s going.",Andy
"You have to go, Toby.",Meredith
"Yeah, come on, Tobes.",Pete

I need to get out of this dress.,Pam
I gotta get out of this dress.,Jim
"Oh, I???m sorry Pam.",Carol Stills
What???s going on?,Jim
[sighs] [whispering] Why are you still here?,Pam
[whispering] I???m so sorry. They were an hour late.,Carol
"No, really, what???s going on?",Jim
"Okay, Okay. Um??? so??? this past year has been really great, and you???ve been great and I just??? I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn???t be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture??? and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.",Pam
"Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?",Jim
About 2 months,Pam
That???s why it???s so clean.,Jim
Yeah.,Pam
"I mean, you were gonna do this without me?",Jim
"Well, you??? you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.",Pam
Oh??? okay. Where would we go?,Jim
Austin? Maybe.,Pam
"I promise you, you don???t have to do this for me.",Jim
I???m doing it for us.,Pam
The last???,Jim
Okay. We???ll take it.,Buyer
[to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about???,Jim
"Hold on a second. [turning] Wait, what did you just say?",Pam
We wanna buy your house.,Buyer
You wanna do this?,Jim
I wanna do this.,Pam
You really want to do this?,Jim
I really want to do this!,Pam
[hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God!,Jim
"Hey, Darryl. [whispers in his ear]",Jim
What? All right!,Darryl
We???re so excited.,Pam
Cool.,Phyllis
"Oh, that???s for PBS executives only.",Woman
I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.,Stanley
"I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I???d love to contribute to your campaign.",David Wallace
Thank you David.,Oscar
"Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper???,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I???ve painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. [applause] And go ahead! [drape drops and everyone cheers]",Pam
"Everyone, Let???s take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just???I kind of meant just everybody from the office.",Pam
"[taking pictures] Very nice. Just a couple dozen more. Smiles, everybody, smiles. All right, that???s great. I got enough. Thank you, everybody.",Photographer
[whispering to Pam] Let???s go outside,Jim
Okay.,Pam
"Okay, I need a drink.",Stanley
"Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith???s drawer] What the???there???s only dandelion tea and raisins in here.",Kevin
"Hey, bottom drawer.",Meredith
Yes!,Kevin
"[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I???m sorry. Jim Halpert doesn???t work here anymore.",Pam
"I didn???t watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It???s just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It???d be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I???m a tragic person. I???m really happy now. But???it would just???just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself ???be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn???t that long.???",Pam
"If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it???s that if you film anybody long enough, they???re going to do something stupid. It???s only human natural.",Kevin
Hey guys.,Dwight
Hi.,Angela
Hey!,All
What about the honeymoon?,Pam
"Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?",Angela
"Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?",Dwight
You know what? Maybe we should talk.,Jim
"Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.",Darryl
What is it?,Kevin
[on the computer] You???re probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...,Andy
I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing???,Pam
Athleap.,Jim
And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We???ll come back to visit. But I think it???s time for us to officially???,Pam
"No, don???t say it. You???re fired! You???re both fired!",Dwight
"Dwight, come on. Don???t end on a bad note.",Jim
Don???t be an idiot. It???s for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you???ve been here. That???s the max.,Dwight
Thanks Dwight.,Pam
"Hey, and if you???re ever in Austin...",Jim
"Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you???re ever in the area, you???ll always have a place to stay???in my barn.",Dwight
There it is.,Jim
"Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don???t have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So??? have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let???s see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So???yes. I???d say I have gotten along with my subordinates.",Dwight
"[on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you???re about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.",Andy
"Oh, Yes!",Kevin
You did good. Real good.,Darryl
Thanks Dad???Darryl.,Andy
"I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I???m exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I???m still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they???re the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you???re in the good old days before you???ve actually left them. [pause] Someone should write a song about that.",Andy
"You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It???s not much. But if you see it in the right way???And that???s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn???t once show me doing my origami.",Oscar
[walking out of the bathroom discovered by all] Uh..ohh!,Creed
[playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn???t matter. ???Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same???,Creed
"Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes???and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that???s???an amazing gift.",Jim
"Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.",Phyllis
Thanks Phyl.,Jim
I still have my medal from that.,Creed
Do you even have a mattress?,Angela
"No, but I still have my medal from that.",Creed
Oscar. Oscar. [crying] I think I???m gay.,Kevin
Why do you say that?,Oscar
[sniffles] It???s just that I???m so emotional.,Kevin
"Yeah, but you???re not gay. You???re not gay.",Oscar
"No, but maybe the reason???",Kevin
You???re not gay.,Oscar
[still playing and singing] And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before.,Creed
"How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?",Erin
"Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?",Darryl
"It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But???[chuckles] no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home. [standing with two cops] Let???s do this.",Creed
I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they???re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You???re not alone sister. Let???s get a beer sometime.,Meredith
I???m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.,Phyllis
"I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn???t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid???wonderful???boring???amazing job.",Jim
I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all???I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There???s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn???t that kind of the point?,Pam
